The NHS is standing firm and says it has no responsibility to provide the treatment, known as Prep.  It says the onus should fall on local authorities instead.  Charities have called the decision "shameful", and warned that lives would suffer as a result.  Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a daily pill that can considerably lower a person's chances of catching HIV.  If taken correctly, it is almost entirely effective in preventing HIV.  NHS England has promised £2m in funding to treat about 500 people with Prep over the next two years.  But after considering representations from stakeholders, it still does not believe it should be the body responsible for offering the drug.  A statement on the NHS England website said: "'As set out in the Local Authorities (Public Health Functions and Entry to Premises by Local Healthwatch Representatives) Regulations 2013, local authorities are the responsible commissioner for HIV prevention services."  Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "Today is a shameful day for HIV prevention.  "This country used to lead the way in the fight against the HIV epidemic, but today, our national health service has washed its hands of one of the most stunning breakthroughs we've seen - a pill which, if taken correctly, is almost 100% effective in preventing HIV. A pill which is already available in America, Canada, France, Kenya and soon to be Australia.  "How did it come to this? It defies belief that, after 18 months of false hope, delays and u-turns in the battle to see Prep made available on the NHS to people at high risk of HIV, today we are in a worse position than when we started."  He said repercussions for those at high risk of HIV infection could be dire.  "It's not right that people who know themselves to be at high risk of HIV have to buy Prep themselves from the internet at considerable personal expense. Currently, only those who can afford it are able to access this life-changing treatment."  The NHS in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not yet made a decision on Prep.	health

A UKIP MEP complained about the pictorial instructions on how to vote, which show a pencil hovering over the Remain box.  The election watchdog said the graphic "shouldn't have been used".  Bristol City Council said it would amend the form and insisted it was not trying to influence the vote.  Follow the latest developments on our live page  Mike Hookem, a UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, said a constituent of his had been alerted to the Bristol area postal voting packs.  "Any ballot papers which have gone out with marks showing either remain or leave boxes being ticked in the example need to be recalled and the person responsible needs to be investigated" Mr Hookem said.  "It may be an isolated incident around Bristol but in the interests of democracy we cannot take that risk."  The Leave.EU campaign tweeted images of the postal ballot instructions and called on supporters to tell them if they had received the packs.  A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: "While it is unlikely that postal voters in Bristol might be persuaded to vote a different way because of the graphic in these instructions, clearly it shouldn't have been used.  "We are following up with the counting officer for Bristol City to ensure that it is amended before any further postal voting packs are issued to voters in the area."  A Bristol City Council spokesperson said: "This form is designed to explain the logistics of voting by post and not to suggest how someone should vote.  "The placement of the pen graphic was entirely incidental and we do not believe that anybody could reasonably be influenced by such a graphic.  "However, given current sensitivities, for all future postal vote dispatches the form and graphic will be amended."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36407596	Doctor urges compulsory mediation in patient care rows	The NHS could save millions of pounds if families and doctors were offered mediation when they disagreed on a treatment, a leading consultant said.  Dr Chris Danbury, an anaesthetist at Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital, said it should be made a legal requirement in England and Wales.  Examples of when mediation should be used include disagreements in whether to turn off life support, he said.  This would avoid a case going to the Court of Protection.  Another instance where mediation could be used was when a patient who is mentally competent did not want to accept a treatment they medically needed.  But one mother, whose son died of a brain tumour, said she was not sure mediation was the best form of persuasion for parents at a vulnerable time.  Dr Danbury, a consultant intensive care physician, said it was not just the cost of going to court that was the problem.  He said the legal route could have a damaging effect on the relationship between the medical team and the family involved.  Speaking at Euroanaesthesia 2016, Mr Danbury said of mediation: "This can be done informally, perhaps by getting another clinician within the institution to act as an 'honest broker'.  "If this fails, then a formal mediation process can be initiated with legal representation on both sides.  "Mediation costs a great deal less than going to court and often preserves the relationship between clinical team and their patient/representatives, which can otherwise be severely damaged by the rigors of court proceedings."  He highlighted one example in which a Jewish family refused to accept their family member had no hope of recovery.  They were offered mediation with the help of a local rabbi, which led to an improved relationship between them and the medical team and the family agreed to switch off the patient's life support machine.  "Sometimes misunderstandings can occur very easily - one doctor may not explain something very well to a family, but then once a colleague intervenes, the situation can be calmed down very quickly," he said.  "But if this should fail, then the default option should be to go to formal mediation by an independent third party.  "It's never too late to talk, and the cost savings to the UK NHS, or in fact any other country doing this, would be immense."  He told BBC Breakfast: "The hardest thing I do is talk to families of critically ill patients. Very occasionally the relationship between the family and clinical teams break down and we have to have a way of resolving that.  "Court is an incredibly pressured environment and it's much better to talk than litigate in our view. It's about allowing a conversation, which perhaps has broken down between the clinical team and the family, to continue and trying to take the pressure out of it."  Debbie Whiteley, whose son Tom died from a brain tumour when he was nine years old, said parents of seriously ill children in hospital were very vulnerable.  "We asked a lot of questions," she said. "You know you spend a lot of time on Google search. You become very institutionalised and it's a really vulnerable time.  "I worry about mediation because it's fine as a form of explanation but not as a form of persuasion.  "Whatever the outcome, you know you, as parents, have to life with that for the rest of your life."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36397725	Vote Leave launches £50m Euro 2016 football contest	The campaign to get Britain out of the EU has launched a contest to win £50m - if you can correctly predict the result of all 51 games in the Euro 2016 football championships.  If no one manages that then there is a £50,000 prize for the person who gets the most consecutive games correct.  Vote Leave has taken out an insurance policy to fund the contest.  But Britain Stronger In Europe has described the contest as a "con" - with odds of winning 8 billion to one.  The £50m represents the amount Vote Leave says Britain sends to the EU a day, a claim disputed by its critics.  The argument that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU has proved controversial because it does not take into account the rebate that the UK gets on its payments to the EU.  A Vote Leave source said the football contest could be a "game changer" for the campaign because it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.  Anyone entering will have to rate themselves on a scale of one to five as to whether they are more likely to back continued membership of the EU.  The campaign admits that the chances of winning the top prize are slim - but says it is "worth a punt".  But Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, said the long odds were the same as those for Vote Leave "coming up with a coherent vision for what life would look like outside the EU".  He added: "Once again Vote Leave put wild guesswork at the heart of their campaign and it is the British people who they are asking to take the risk."  Hosts France take on Romania in the first game of Euro 2016 on 10 June, with England and Wales in action the following day.  Vote Leave's campaign director Dominic Cummings said: "This is the chance of a lifetime - just imagine what you could do with the £50m we send to the EU every single day.  "We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP."  You are staggeringly unlikely to win this competition.  There are 36 games in the group stages of the tournament, when there could be a victory for either side or a draw.  Then there are 15 knockout games, which cannot be drawn.  The odds of picking all 51 games randomly are one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is a bit better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street.  Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages, which may go down to goal difference or even goals scored.  The competition is a based on a similar contest in the US, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest men, involving the annual men's NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness.  Vote Leave says the contest is free to enter and is open to anyone who is over the age of 18 who is registered to vote in the EU referendum.  Entrants must supply their telephone number, email address and home address to qualify for the prize.  Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to "opt out" from receiving campaign information "at any time".  The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over its £350m a week claim.  In a statement on the authority's website, Sir Andrew Dilnot said that he was "disappointed" that the campaign group continued to claim the full amount could be spent in the UK, saying it "undermined trust in official statistics".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36396069	UK spy agencies 'recruiting more women'	UK intelligence agencies say they are recruiting more female staff - and are targeting middle-age and "mid-career" women for jobs.  MI6 and and GCHQ advertised on the Mumsnet website for the first time this year, and MI5 has raised its target for women employees to 45% by 2021.  Flexible working and the importance of "high emotional intelligence" are also being stressed in recruitment.  The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women.  Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37% of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19% of senior civil servants in the agencies.  One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - "agree wholeheartedly" with the need for "diversity" in agency staff.  It says action has been taken since the report was published to "increase their focus" on "all aspects of diversity", including recruiting more women.  Recruitment targets, "diversity champions", events such as a recent "Women in Cyber" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion.  They also say they are doing more to "promote a flexible working culture" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles.  The three agencies also said they were always looking for "new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach".  MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women "not currently in work" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year.  GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its "fast-stream" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a "non-traditional graduate route".  The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5% to 46% of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40%. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 2016/17 after seeing a 4% drop in women - to 41% of new recruits.  The government also said career support for female staff was having a "real impact" with increased numbers of women applying for senior roles in MI5.	politics

More transparency is needed about the "complex" way decisions are made at the Council of the European Union, the European Scrutiny Committee said.  They want to gauge how much legislation "is simply nodded through" by ministers after talks between officials.  The government said it was "fully committed to high levels of transparency in EU decision-making".  A Foreign Office spokesman added: "That's why we pushed for and recently secured a greater role for national parliaments in scrutinising EU legislative proposals."  Along with the European Parliament, the Council of the EU is the organisation's main decision-making body.  In its report, the European Scrutiny Committee said the process for agreement at the Council was complex, could involve discussions by one of 150 working groups at the official level and at the ambassadorial level - Coreper - before being agreed by ministers.  It recognised that progress had been made in increasing the information available about the final outcome of negotiations between ministers.  But they said it was "still very unclear how those decisions are reached", with some having to be agreed by consensus after years of difficult discussions "mostly at official level".  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, told the committee that decision-making by consensus meant that the process was one of "trying to stop really bad things happening and damage reduction".  But one of his predecessors in the role, Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett, who backs the EU Remain campaign, told the committee that she had never agreed to a measure that she thought "on balance, was in any way against the interest of our country" and said Qualified Majority Voting had allowed the UK government to advance its interests.  Committee chairman Sir Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic, said: "UK citizens should be fully informed and given the facts as to how the 55% of EU laws which govern them are made.  "Many UK laws and measures include obligations derived from EU law. The bulk of decisions on such laws are made by officials and then nodded through by ministers.  "There is no information on how those decisions are reached, including who has had to compromise and at what price. Over 50% of decisions are agreed by consensus, which means policy differences can be invisible to the electorate."  The committee urged the government to "take action" to make more information available to the UK Parliament and to take a lead in the EU by "making public statements of the reason for its vote more frequently".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36383884	Thousands of families await care cost decisions	Almost 12,000 people in England are still waiting to hear if they are due millions of pounds in backdated care fees - some nearly four years after applying.  They are among 60,000 people who think they may have paid for care that should have been funded by the NHS.  Many of them fear they could have wrongly sold their family homes to cover their costs.  NHS England says 80% of the backlog has been cleared and £140m refunded.  All the families put in retrospective applications in 2012 and 2013 to see if they were eligible for NHS "continuing care".  It covers fees when someone has very high nursing needs as opposed to needing help with things like washing and dressing.  BBC Radio 4 's You and Yours programme spoke to Andrea White, who is waiting to hear the result of her claim.  Her mother, Elizabeth Cockburn, who died in 2009, had sold her bungalow to pay for care home fees of more than £100,000.  "It wasn't until 2012 that I realised I could make a retrospective claim," said Andrea.  "It then took four years for the NHS to make a decision and a further six months to let me know what that decision was. A lesser person would have given up, I think, and even I have had to have legal advice as to how to proceed.  "It must also be very, very frustrating for the NHS actually doing the assessments."  Andrea was recently told her application had been refused. She plans to appeal and says she hopes it will not take another four years.  It has been described as the NHS's "best-kept secret", as many people are not aware that older and disabled people who need more than means-tested social care can apply for fully funded NHS continuing care.  They must have a "primary health need" to qualify. Care and accommodation costs can be covered if someone lives in a nursing home but people who live at home can also be eligible.  The backdated applications were allowed after the Department of Health announced two deadlines for claims dating back to 2004.  Anyone claiming for the period 1 April 2004 - 31 March 2011 had to apply by 30 September 2012.  Retrospective claims for 1 April 2011 - 31 March 2012 had to be submitted to the relevant clinical commissioning group (CCG) by 31 March 2013.  Howard Scott has spent a decade trying to recoup more than £43,000 that was paid to nursing homes for his mother's care.  He feels his own ill health has been made worse by the stress of the process.  "My emphysema has definitely got worse, more than if I hadn't had the additional burden of having to sort this out with so many different people, telling them the same story time and time again. It was about the principle - now I just want the money."  He claims the NHS CCG responsible for investigating the backdated claim has been disorganised and slow.  His wife Barbara says they received another letter informing them that some care home notes and documents had been lost or destroyed.  "It's been absolutely horrendous. They've lost the documents - again. We are no further forward than we were 10 years ago. We even have correspondence [sent] the same day, from two different departments, in the same building, telling us different stories. Nobody can give us any answers, that's the problem."  But it's a complex and time-consuming process, according to NHS Clinical Commissioners, which represents the CCGs that decide whether or not someone should have received NHS continuing care.  "We do absolutely understand the frustration, stress and anger that patients, carers and loved ones are expressing in relation to the claims not yet resolved," said its chief executive, Julie Wood.  "In April 2013, CCGs inherited this backlog of 60,000 claims as well as dealing with current patients requesting to be assessed for continuing healthcare. It's really complicated."  A national framework is used to decide cases so consistent decisions are made.  "They have to assess an individual's case across 12 'domains', looking at behaviour, cognition, communication, mobility, that sort of thing. Then they have to consider the severity of the need.  "Some CCGs have taken on some additional staff, like nurses who understand people's needs. Some have separated out retrospective claims from current claims."  But it can be hard to source old notes from nursing homes, social services, district nursing teams, GP practices or hospitals.  "In some cases, some of the paperwork may not be there," said Julie. "The people considering these claims can only work with the records they can actually access that go back to where they were receiving care at the time."  The totals paid out by CCGs for backdated NHS continuing healthcare claims is included in NHS England's annual accounts.  In 2013-14 it was £77m; in 2014-15 the figure was £61.7m.  The 2015-16 figure will be published in the NHS England annual report in July.	health

Mark Collett and his girlfriend Eva Van Housen - who has a swastika tattoo - have been handing out Vote Leave leaflets and badges from an official-looking stall in Leeds city centre.  Mr Collett was chair of the BNP Youth Wing before the party expelled him.  Vote Leave said he was not part of their campaign and they had asked him to stop using their material.  Eva Van Housen posted a picture on Facebook on 8 May with a Vote Leave badge pinned on a top which revealed the swastika tattoo with the comment "had a really great time today with Mark doing a Vote Leave stall". She describes herself as a "white-national socialist" on Twitter.  Vote Leave is the officially designated campaign to get Britain out of the EU in 23 June's referendum.  A spokesman for the Yorkshire branch of the campaign said they had asked Mr Collett to stop campaigning with their materials on 8 May.  But on Facebook Van Housen posted on 15 May that the couple "did another really great Vote Leave stall today".  Mr Collett posted a photo last weekend of the couple at "another very successful Vote Leave stall this weekend with the help of some other veteran nationalists".  Vote Leave are looking into how the former senior BNP member managed to get hold of their campaign materials.  On his Facebook page, Mr Collett has called on other nationalists to campaign for Vote Leave posting "if you want to do your own stall contact Vote Leave and they will send you everything you need to get started".  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "Mark Collett and his associates are not part of our campaign.  "We are a volunteer organisation, but anyone who is or was in the past a BNP campaigner is asked not to campaign for us or to distribute Vote Leave material."  One Vote Leave organiser in Yorkshire said Mr Collett had signed up to the campaign using a fake email address under a different name. When they found out who he was, he was de-registered as a supporter.  But in the two weeks since that happened Mark Collett has continued campaigning with his girlfriend using Vote Leave materials outside shops in Leeds.  Ms Van Housen told BBC News she felt "very strongly about leaving the EU" and had obtained campaign materials from her local Vote Leave branch to set up a stall.  She added: "I have spoken to members of the public of all races, nationalities and sexual orientations, and we have had a very positive response from the public, they have greatly appreciated our campaigning work and we have truly made a difference.  "I have in no way brought my political views in to my Vote Leave campaign work. This is about leaving the EU and only that."  She said Vote Leave asked her to stop using their materials when they discovered that Mr Collett was a former member of the BNP.  "Vote Leave is a non-affiliated volunteer campaigning group, they have absolutely no right in telling me and my partner to discontinue the stalls," she told the BBC.  "Myself and my partner and any other nationalists will continue to hold Vote Leave stalls and leaflet up until the referendum. My political tattoos and beliefs are left out of my campaign work entirely."  Mr Collett has been contacted for a response but has yet to provide one.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36388050	Teen cancer death rate causes alarm	Too many teenagers and young adults are dying of some types of cancer, a Europe-wide report warns.  Their survival rates for cancers such as leukaemia are much lower than in younger children, says a report in the Lancet Oncology.  The researchers suggest differences in tumours, delays in diagnosis and treatment and a lack of clinical trials for that age group are to blame.  Cancer Research UK said it was crucial to find out what was going wrong.  The study analysed data from 27 countries on nearly 57,000 childhood cancers and 312,000 cancers in teenagers and young adults.  Overall, five-year survival rates were higher in teenagers and young adults at 82% compared with 79% in children.  But those better prospects were largely driven by the older age-group getting cancers with a better prognosis.  The overall rate concealed areas of concern where survival was "significantly worse" for eight cancers commonly found in both age groups.  Dr Annalisa Trama, from The National Institute of Cancer in Milan, Italy said: "The good news is that the number of children, adolescents and young adults surviving for at least five years after diagnosis has risen steadily over time in Europe.  "However, we found that adolescents and young adults still tend to die earlier than children for several cancers common to these age groups, particularly blood cancers."  Dr Alan Worsley, from Cancer Research UK, said: "While it's great news that the number of children, teenagers and young adults surviving cancer continues to improve, it's also clear that for some cancers, survival in different age groups is improving faster than in others.  "We need to find out whether adolescents are faring worse because of how their cancer is managed in the clinic or whether it's because the underlying biology is fundamentally different at these ages.  "Answering these questions is a big part of the reason why we've launched the Cancer Research UK Kids and Teens campaign."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36393483	EU referendum: Salmond predicts Scots poll in two years if UK backs Brexit	Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.  He said if Scotland was "dragged out" of the EU "against our will" on 23 June he believed there would be another vote - and it would be for independence.  But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be "stoked by fear" of a second Scottish referendum.  Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.  Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.  Former First Minister Mr Salmond told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum "would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw" from the EU, should it vote to leave.  He said: "If you had the situation where Scotland in four weeks' time votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum."  It was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.  The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.  But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond.  The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.  "In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time."  But Conservative MP Dr Fox accused Mr Salmond of "yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum".  Dr Fox said: "I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK."  He said the EU referendum was "a decision that we take as the UK .. every vote counts. It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be side tracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum."  During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to "get the emotions ramped up".  Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the "scaremongering" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: "It wouldn't be economic Apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in."  He said: "That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns ... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose. To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case."  Some of the young voters taking part criticised "tit-for-tat" attacks during the campaign, describing it as "petty name-calling" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.  UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been "appalling". She said there had been a focus on migration "on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government .. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy".  Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs.  Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, the Conservative former defence secretary Mr Fox said: "Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after."  "Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so."  But Labour's Mr Johnson said: "At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process ... There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas."  He added: "Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."  Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: "We just don't know". She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a "Plan B".	politics

The jab protects against human papillomavirus, which increases the risk of oral, anal and penile cancers.  It has been offered to school-age girls, to protect them from cervical cancer, since 2008.  However, there have been repeated calls for the vaccine to be given to all boys as well.  In November 2015, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises all UK governments - called for the HPV jab to be offered to gay men up to the age of 45.  The JCVI said there would also be a "substantial benefit" in reducing the number of genital warts.  Health minister Jane Ellison announced: "Through this pilot, the HPV vaccine will be offered during existing appointments at selected GUM (sexual health) and HIV clinics in England to test delivery in these settings.  "Public Health England is in the process of agreeing which GUM and HIV clinics will take part in the pilot.  "A full roll-out of a HPV vaccination programme for men who have sex with men will be dependent on the progress and outcome of the pilot."  The jab is also being trialled in Wales.	health

She reflects on this final stage, and looks to the future.  "I'm sure this is completely normal and everyone who's ever had a cancer diagnosis will think this - I am thinking about what if this cancer comes back," Derbyshire explains, trying to compose herself.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of July 2015, and has been filming diaries to help demystify the treatment.  In this latest diary, recorded across April and May, she undergoes 30 doses of radiotherapy in six weeks.  Half way through the treatment, she experiences what she describes as an "uncharacteristic wobble".  "Obviously I never want [the cancer to reoccur], I never want to go through chemotherapy again ever, I just do not want it to come back... I just want this to have been a blip and get on with my life, my kids' life, my partner's life, my family's future," she adds.  As well as having chemotherapy from November 2015 to February this year, the radiotherapy treatment was recommended to her after her mastectomy seven months earlier. Doctors warned that despite the surgery, some breast cancer cells may still remain.  Radiotherapy uses high-energy rays to destroy these cancerous cells, by targeting the specific region of the body that requires treatment.  "You lie on a bed, you put your arms up, you've taken your top layer of clothing off and there is a large disc above you which angles," Derbyshire says, explaining the process.  "The radiation beams come from there and target the right hand side of me, the right breast.  "But you can't see the beams, they don't shoot out from this large piece of machinery, it's not like Star Wars," she adds.  The treatment is not available at every hospital, meaning Derbyshire had to cover more than 1,000 miles over the six-week period, travelling to St Luke's Cancer Centre at the Royal Surrey NHS County Hospital.  "Clearly it is an issue for hundreds and hundreds of patients, you can't always get the bespoke treatment that you need in your local NHS hospital," she says.  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.  Watch Victoria Derbyshire's first four breast cancer diaries here.  Over a month into recording her latest diary, and Derbyshire - with a smile on her face - documents signs that her body is beginning to recover from previous rounds of treatment.  As she points the camera towards her eyes, she explains: "Twelve weeks after chemotherapy I'd lost all my eyelashes and most of my eyebrows... [now] they're back. It's true, they do come back."  She also shows the camera the scar caused by her mastectomy last September, in the hope of alleviating other people's fears about what the skin will look like once they have had a breast removed.  "I hope you'll agree, that scar is minimal and that is because the consultants and the NHS are so brilliant," she says.  One week later, and there is cause for more celebration, as Derbyshire leaves the hospital.  "It's Wednesday 25 May and I'm done - I'm done. That was my last radiotherapy session. Thirty sessions - five a week for the last six weeks - and it's finished. Wow, I can't believe it," Derbyshire says, unable to hold back the tears.  "Gosh, I'm so happy. Wow. I feel elated. I feel liberated. There are so many people I want to thank. And most of them work for the NHS."  Derbyshire will still have to take the drug tamoxifen daily for the next five to 10 years in order to try and stop the breast cancer from coming back - which can lead to side effects including hot flushes, feeling dizzy, headaches, leg cramps, joint pain, weight gain and changes in mood and concentration.  But in terms of major treatment, Derbyshire hopes "that is it... if all goes according to plan".  "On 31 July 2015 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. One mastectomy, six sessions of chemotherapy, 30 doses of radiotherapy later, I feel like this could be a fresh start.  "And I know not everybody gets that opportunity. I am completely aware of that and so I am very grateful, exceptionally grateful.  "I want to say to you, if you are going through cancer treatment or you are about to go through cancer treatment: 'I'm sending you all my love and strength. Take it, have it. You can have it. Please do. And just keep going.'"  And as for her own future: "It's time to crack on with the rest of my life," she says.	health

A report by the watchdog estimated the delays were costing £820m a year.  And it warned they also put older patients at risk because they lose mobility during extended stays.  It comes after delays hit record levels this winter because of a lack of support available in the community.  The NAO said research shows that for every day spent in hospital an older patient can lose 5% of their muscle strength. There is also the increased risk of infection.  The figures show the number of delays has risen by a third in the past two years to 1.15m days.  It estimated these delays cost hospitals £820m, whereas care in the community for such patients would be about £180m.  But the NAO said this was likely to be an underestimate, as the NHS only measured delays from the point patients are deemed ready for discharge - the report said they could well face delays waiting for this to be recorded or elsewhere during their stay in hospital.  It said the "truer figure" could be nearer 2.7m days of delay.  Waiting for nursing home places or home care were cited as the two fastest growing reasons for delays. It said workforce shortages were likely to be a major cause of this.  NAO head Amyas Morse said: "There are currently far too many older people in hospitals who do not need to be there.  "Without radical action, this problem will worsen and add further strain to the financial sustainability of the NHS and local government."  The report found steps, such as earlier planning for discharge and the creation of specialist teams for frail older patients, were being taken to tackle the problem, but they were not yet widespread enough.  Simon Bottery, of the Independent Age charity, said the problem was likely to get worse because of the ageing population.  "The situation is clearly unsustainable."  But a Department of Health spokesman said steps were being made to tackle the issue.  He said the NHS was being provided with extra funding this Parliament - the budget is increasing by 8% above inflation - while a joint pot had been established with council social care teams to encourage better joint working to help frail older people.  "Elderly patients should never be stuck in hospital unnecessarily," he added.	health

Downing Street said the Amstrad founder would be touring the country, championing enterprise and encouraging firms to take on more apprentices.  Last year he said he was quitting Labour because of his "disillusionment" with the party.  The businessman said he was "delighted" at his latest appointment, adding that "not enough of our young people know about apprenticeships and what they offer, and too few feel empowered to set up their own business".  Skills Minister Nick Boles said Lord Sugar had "huge credibility among young people".  In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, Lord Sugar claimed former mayor of London Boris Johnson had gone "off the rails" in his criticisms of the European Union in recent weeks.  "These people that are advocating exit, with all due respect to them…some of them are politicians, and there's an ex-mayor who has gone off the rails at the moment, I had a lot of respect for him until a couple of weeks ago with some of the outlandish things he has been saying."  Despite being a strong supporter of the UK remaining in the EU, Lord Sugar said David Cameron and other pro-EU ministers needed to substantiate the claims they were making about the economic damage that a vote to leave would do.  "I said to the prime minister the other day you have a whole host of people giving you a load of statistics which you are rattling off.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36378972	Woman's bid to use deceased daughter's eggs continues	A 60-year-old woman who wants to use her late daughter's frozen eggs to give birth to her own grandchild is continuing her legal battle.  The woman is appealing against the UK regulator's refusal to allow her to take her only child's eggs to a US clinic to be used with donor sperm.  Her daughter, who died five years ago, was said to have approved of the plan.  The mother lost a High Court case last year but was subsequently granted permission to challenge the decision.  The latest round of the case is being heard at the Court of Appeal in London, before a panel of three judges.  The UK fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said, in 2014, the daughter's eggs could not be released from storage in London because she had not given her full written consent before she had died, from bowel cancer at the age of 28.  But, in the latest legal proceedings, lawyers acting for the mother told the judges she wanted to fulfil her daughter's wishes to carry a child created from her frozen eggs and "raise that child".  Jenni Richards QC added the eggs would "simply be allowed to perish" if the court did not rule in her favour.  Meanwhile, Catherine Callaghan, appearing for the HFEA, said in a written argument before the court: "It is natural to feel sympathy for the appellants' loss and for their wish to keep their daughter's memory alive by trying to conceive a child using their daughter's eggs."  But it was not the court's role to decide whether it would have permitted the mother to undergo fertility treatment using her daughter's eggs.  Ms Callaghan added: "Rather its role is to determine whether Mr justice Ouseley erred in concluding that the HFEA's statutory approvals committee acted lawfully and rationally in exercising its broad discretion to refuse to authorise export of the frozen eggs to a treatment centre in New York for use in the way proposed."  During earlier High Court proceedings in June 2015, the court was told her daughter was desperate to have children and had asked her mother to "carry my babies".  Lawyers acting for the mother and her 59-year-old husband told Mr Justice Ouseley the daughter would have been "devastated" if she had known her eggs could not be used.  But the judge ruled that the HFEA was entitled to find the daughter had not given "the required consent" and said there had been no breach of the family's human rights.  Although she consented for her eggs to be stored for use after her death, she did not fill in a separate form outlining how she wished them to be used.  He said he was dismissing the case "conscious of the additional distress which this will bring to the claimants, whose aim has been to honour their daughter's dying wish".  It was thought if the case had been successful her mother could have become the first person in the world to become pregnant using a dead daughter's eggs.  In February 2016, when seeking permission to appeal, her lawyers argued there was "clear evidence" of what the daughter wanted to happen to her eggs when she died.  Lord Justice Treacy said the case papers had left him doubtful as to whether there would be "sufficiently strong" reasons to allow the challenge to continue further.  But after hearing submissions in court, he concluded there was "an arguable case with a real prospect of success".	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36379455	Zika: Africa 'reasonably well prepared'	Parts of West Africa are still reeling from the worst ever Ebola outbreak. But now they're bracing themselves for the next potentially devastating epidemic.  Last week the World Health Organization announced that the Asian strain of Zika currently sweeping through Latin America had arrived on the doorstep of Africa in Cape Verde.  The archipelago sits just off the north west coast of Africa, not far from where Ebola first struck.  But lessons from that disaster are being learned and applied to this latest global health emergency, according to WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti.  "Following the Ebola outbreak, countries made a real effort to improve their preparedness, their surveillance systems, their response systems and to some extent their lab diagnostic capacity.  "If you're talking about (the worst Ebola affected countries) Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, they are better prepared than most." Dr Moeti said.  But many challenges remain. Zika is very different to Ebola.  It's not as deadly. In fact most people infected don't show any symptoms at all.  The main risk is to pregnant women because of the link to women who've been infected giving birth to brain-damaged babies.  Dr Moeti said it's impossible to predict where Zika will arrive in the region from, but she's expecting it to be from Cape Verde or Latin America.  "I think... following up on people who have travelled to these at-risk areas, and monitoring their condition will be a challenge.  "Also, being able to detect cases of microcephaly, whereever that arises, will be challenging because it happens sometime after someone might have been exposed"  Responding to health emergencies, such as the current Zika outbreak, is at the top of the agenda at the annual World Health Assembly at the UN in Geneva.  Three thousand health officials, policy makers, charity representatives and pharmaceutical representatives are gathering in Geneva this week from around the world to discuss priorities for the coming year, and talk budgets for funding them.  It's an enormous event with an enormous amount of good will.  But what's desperately needed on the ground in Zika-hit areas is practical solutions, such as better tools to fight mosquitoes, better advice for desperately worried pregnant women, and a vaccine that can protect the most vulnerable.  Parts of Africa may be "reasonably well prepared" for Zika, but as the Director General of the WHO Dr Margaret Chan put it during her opening speech in Geneva:  "For infectious diseases, you cannot trust the past when planning for the future."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36366946	Concern Zika causes baby eye problems	Scientists studying the Zika outbreak in Brazil are becoming increasingly concerned the virus may cause eye damage in babies.  Stanford University researchers found abnormal bleeding and lesions in the eyes of three infant boys whose mothers had caught Zika while pregnant.  They want any babies known to be affected by Zika to have eye checks.  The journal of Ophthalmology findings follow another recent study that saw similar eye problems in Zika babies.  The disease is already known to cause a serious baby brain defect called microcephaly.  What is not clear is whether eye problems might be a complication of this rather than the Zika infection itself. Either is possible.  All of the three infants the researchers from Stanford and the University of Sao Paulo examined also had microcephaly.  The eye damage they found in the baby boys was to the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina.  There was abnormal blood vessel growth, bleeding and torpedo-shaped lesions.  Researcher Dr Darius Moshfeghi said the next step was to determine the root cause - Zika or microcephaly - to better understand which infants would need eye checks.  "To begin with it's probably sensible just to screen babies with microcephaly," he said.  "But if it turns out that Zika can cause these eye problems independently, then we would need to screen all infants of infected mothers."  He said some of the eye abnormalities would resolve or be treatable, but others could cause lasting, irreversible damage to vision.  With no vaccine or treatment, pregnant women have been advised to cover up to protect themselves against the biting mosquitoes that carry Zika.  More than 60 countries and territories now have continuing Zika transmission.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36372617	GPs praised for 'dramatic' cut in antibiotic prescriptions	GPs in England have "dramatically" reduced the number of antibiotics they give to patients, latest figures show.  NHS Improvement says prescriptions for all types of antibiotic were down by more than 2.6 million on the previous year to about 34 million in 2015-16.  They say it is a "fantastic result" and shows doctors are being careful not to over-prescribe them.  It is part of a wider drive to stop harmful infections developing resistance to antibiotics.  In the UK, the largest chunk of antibiotic prescribing - 80% - occurs outside of hospital.  And half of these prescriptions are to treat chest infections.  There is no point in giving them if the cause of illness is a virus, such as the flu.  The government has offered a financial incentive to get GPs to cut down on their prescribing.  Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) get a Quality Premium payment if family doctors hit the target.  The figures are impressive. But that should come as no surprise. There have been growing concerns about the use of antibiotics as the report last week by Lord Jim O'Neill demonstrated.  But this success is also down to money. GPs have been paid to reduce their use of antibiotics.  Local health bosses were given extra money by NHS England to get prescribing down and they have used this to incentivise doctors. Different arrangements were made in different areas, but some GP practices received in excess of £20,000 for hitting the targets. Next year the targets have been extended to 4% for overall use and 20% for broad spectrum antibiotics.  In the NHS money, it seems, talks - but if it helps tackle what experts have described as a "greater threat than cancer" nobody will be complaining.  The figures show GPs have overshot the targets.  The target reduction for all types of antibiotic had been set at 1%, but the actual reduction was about 7%.  Prescriptions for broad-spectrum antibiotics - drugs that should be reserved for tackling the most serious, hard-to-treat bacterial infections - went down by 16%, from 3.9 million prescriptions in 2014-15 to 3.3 million the following year.  The target had been a 10% reduction.  Dr Mike Durkin, from NHS Improvement, said: "This [is a] fantastic result achieved in just one year."  He said they would continue to work to bring the figures down further.  "Every year, too many people suffer and lose their lives due to antibiotic-resistant infections," he said.  "At a time when the NHS has advanced in many areas of patient care, science and technology, we must work to prevent healthcare going backwards to a time where antibiotics are no longer fighting infections.  "This is why efforts in the NHS to reduce the overprescribing of antibiotics are crucial, and these latest figures are a significant step forward in this fight."  Dr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors faced pressure from patients to prescribe antibiotics, but that it was their duty to say no sometimes.  "We need to continue to work together to make the public realise that prescribing antibiotics is not always the answer to treating minor, self-limiting illness," she said.	health

Ministers plan to overhaul the funding system in September 2017 and charge those studying to be front-line health workers for their degrees.  But the Royal College of Nursing and Unison are warning it could turn people off NHS careers and worsen shortages.  Student nurses, midwives and staff such as physiotherapists will be affected.  They are currently entitled to bursaries of £4,500 to £5,500 if they live in London - on top of a grant of £1,000 each year during their course. The course fees are also covered.  But the government has proposed scrapping these and introducing university fees to bring health staff in line with other students.  Ministers argue that the move will lead to an increase in nurse students - of about 10,000 - as applicants for courses currently outnumber the places available by two to one. This is because there is a cap on places.  But unions have warned the move could end up putting off prospective students.  To strengthen their case, Unison and the National Union of Students commissioned research group London Economics to carry out an analysis of the potential impact.  The research, based on modelling, suggested the numbers starting courses could drop by about 6.5% from 31,000 a year to 29,000.  They argue the courses are quite different from normal studying as nurses spend half their time working in the NHS and do not get long holidays where they can spend time doing paid work as other students do.  RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: "Our members tell us that the fees could put people off, particularly older students who come into nursing later on. They are very important for the diversity of the workforce. This seems a risky move at a time when we are short of staff."  Earlier this month, a report by the Public Accounts Committee warned that the NHS was short of about 50,000 front-line staff.  Ms Davies said she would like to see the government pause its plans and carry out a full risk assessment to see what the likely impact will be.  Her warning comes as nurses and other staff prepare to attend a rally in central London over the plans.  Unison head of health Christina McAnea said she was worried the move could make "an already difficult situation much worse".  "With too few staff on the wards, the impact on patient safety could well be disastrous."  A Department of Health spokesman said the changes were designed to increase the numbers in training and would mean students could access greater financial support in the form of loans, but he urged the profession to submit concerns to the consultation on the changes.  "We need more home-grown nurses so the NHS doesn't have to rely on expensive agency staff or overseas nurses," he added.	health

The cumulative impact that the transfer of powers was having on the "integrity" of the union had not been considered, the Lords Constitution Committee said.  Further granting of powers, it said, should be subject to an assessment of their effect on the UK's cohesion.  The SNP said the peers were "trundling out all the same old arguments".  The UK government has insisted the union is stronger as a result of the new settlement for Scotland, the proposed strengthening of the National Assembly for Wales and the Stormont Parliament in Northern Ireland and the Northern Powerhouse plan to empower Greater Manchester and other City regions by giving them responsibilities for health care, transport and planning.  But the cross-party committee has expressed reservations about the pace of devolution and the thinking behind it, arguing it has been "ad hoc and reactive" with too little thought given to the preservation and enhancement of the union.  Lord Lang, the Conservative peer and former Scottish secretary who heads the committee, said the union was "being taken for granted" and any further devolution must be governed by a new set of "constitutional principles" that safeguarded its integrity.  Under an agreement brokered in the aftermath of the No vote in the 2014 independence referendum, Holyrood is assuming substantial new powers over tax, including air passenger duty, borrowing and welfare as well as the right to legislate in a ream of new areas.  But the peers warned against Scotland taking any further steps towards "full fiscal autonomy", saying this would break the union apart. They also said the UK Parliament should scrutinise much more closely any future proposal for a second independence referendum.  While welcoming the more modest pace of devolution in England, the peers said the case for greater self-government for England remained "unresolved" and had clearly not been satisfied by either regional devolution deals or changes to voting procedures in the House of Commons giving MPs from English constituents a veto over legislation affecting England only.  "Since 1999, devolution has been largely demand-led and piecemeal," Lord Lang said. "The committee saw no evidence of strategic thinking about its cumulative impact on the union as a whole.  "The government does not seem to recognise the pressures being placed on the United Kingdom by the ad hoc, reactive manner in which devolution has taken place, and continues to take place. It's now time to focus more on the union."  Successive UK governments, he added, had "failed to adapt" to devolution and the sheer number of policy areas which were no longer the preserve of Whitehall, a state of affairs which required much closer collaboration if UK-wide policies were to be implemented properly.  As such, the devolved administrations must be regarded as "established components" of the UK's unwritten constitution.  "Instead of the 'devolve and forget' attitude of the past, the UK government should be engaging with the devolved administrations across the whole breadth of government policy," he said.  "Not interfering, but co-operating and actively managing the cross-border and UK-wide implications of differing policy and service delivery choices. Shared and overlapping policy areas need to be handled sensibly, with each administration conscious of the interests of the others."  The committee is made up of pro-Unionist Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem peers as well crossbenchers. The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Northern Irish political parties are not represented.  The SNP said the report was "irrelevant" and questioned the right of unelected peers to pass judgement on Scotland's governing arrangements.  "This report indicates a spectacular failure of the committee to grasp devolution, and its recommendations would break the vow and promises made to the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign," said SNP MP Pete Wishart.  "The House of Lords seem to be confused that in the Fiscal Framework - agreed between the Scottish and UK Governments - it is crystal clear that the Barnett formula will remain."	politics

The watchdog said nearly three-quarters of care homes that had been rated inadequate in 2014 had now improved.  The CQC said 205 of the 372 homes had been re-inspected and moved from inadequate to requiring improvement, while 68 were now rated good.  But 99 homes did not have their rating amended and 34 are no longer operating.  There are more than 11,000 homes providing care for people who are older or disabled in England. Each are rated from outstanding to inadequate by the CQC.  The CQC introduced a tougher inspection system for care homes in October 2014.  Most homes were found to be good, but the CQC has analysed what happened to the 372 homes that got the lowest rating between 1 October 2014 and 31 March this year.  They found 73% had made some improvement, while 34 homes had gone out of business - either because of enforcement action by the CQC or because of choosing to close.  Care homes and the NHS: The silent scandal?  The CQC said among the changes made by homes that had demonstrated improvement were investment in the training of staff, and cleaning to make sure rooms and communal areas were "homely and welcoming" at all times.  CQC's chief inspector of adult social care Andrea Sutcliffe said: "While services that have moved to 'requires improvement' are heading in the right direction, I am clear that this is still not good enough and providers cannot afford to be complacent.  "Evidence of consistent practice and sustainability is what we are looking for, to ensure people always get the good care they deserve."  The chief executive of Care England, Martin Green, said the report "clearly shows that despite the care sector facing significant challenges, there is clear evidence that improvements in the quality of care are being sustained".  Care home owners welcomed the findings but warned many were struggling to survive because of cuts to funding from local authorities.	health

Leading surgeon Prof Francesco Rubino described the gut operation as "the closest thing to a cure" available.  UK guidelines already recommend the gut surgery for some patients.  But experts argue the guidance needs to be expanded and made more prominent, as most doctors do not offer it.  About three million people in the UK have type-2 diabetes, which can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, blindness and heart disease.  The team predict up to 100,000 obese diabetic patients - including those who are only mildly obese and have already tried medication and lifestyle changes - could benefit from the surgery, which involves removing part of the stomach or re-routing the gut.  But they estimate fewer than 6,000 bariatric operations were carried out for type-2 diabetes last year.  They looked at a growing body of evidence that suggests the treatment - traditionally weight-loss surgery - alters gut hormones and the lining of the gut to get blood sugars under control.  This reduces the need for daily drugs or insulin injections and leads to a period of remission in more than a third of cases, experts say.  Scientists argue the operations - which cost about £6,000 in established centres - would pay for themselves within two years, by cutting the cost of drugs and the expense of treating diabetic complications.  They say the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) needs to make this option explicit in their diabetes guidance and to expand it to ensure long-term diabetics on the cusp of obesity are also considered.  Prof Rubino, co-author of the report and a surgeon at King's College London, said: "Surgery represents a radical departure from conventional approaches to diabetes.  "The new guidelines effectively introduce, both conceptually and practically, one of the biggest changes for diabetes care in modern times."  Meanwhile Prof Mark Baker, at NICE, said the paper appeared to be broadly in line with the updated NICE guideline on obesity.  But Simon O'Neill at charity Diabetes UK, said: "Many people who stand to benefit from this potentially life-saving treatment are missing out due to needless barriers to obesity surgery services.  "Even people who meet the criteria for the surgery are made to wait too long."  In a joint statement, endorsed by 45 international organisations and published in the journal Diabetes Care, experts put out a global call for surgery to be seen as a standard part of diabetes treatment in certain cases.  The guidelines emerged at a summit organised by charity Diabetes UK, the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, Chinese Diabetes Society and Diabetes India.	health

But at an event in central London organised by the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics - a think tank which he helped to set up - he made it clear he would be unapologetic for his role in taking Britain to war in 2003.  He certainly hadn't drawn the lesson that western military intervention in the Middle East was counter-productive. He talked of a "generational struggle" against so-called Islamic State, saying "we are not being honest with our public if we are saying it is possible to defeat these people without making the commitment to defeat them and to do what it takes to defeat them".  For him, that was likely to require Western boots on the ground:  "You have got to defeat these people on the ground. The armed forces of America, the UK, France, other major countries have both experience and capability so even if we are using them in support of local forces, you have just got to decide what our objective is. Is our objective to defeat this enemy? My answer to that is yes.  "Do not be under any doubt at all - if you are going to defeat these people you are going to have to go and wage a proper ground war against them. The only question for us is if we are prepared to do that or not."  And he made no apology for toppling Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.  "There is a line today that's very common in western discourse, left and right, that says 'you know what, it would be better that these dictators stay in power'. I don't personally agree with it, but it doesn't matter if I agree with it or I don't - what the Arab Spring shows you is these countries with young populations, with radical forces operating within them, are not going to accept that...  "The answer is not have 20% of the population controlling the other 80% - that ain't going to work."  He drew his own lesson from the Iraq conflict, namely that it wasn't that it had been wrong to go to war but it was a lack of planning for the aftermath that had been at fault.  "We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime. The lesson is not complicated. It's simple."  So today we had a taster of how the former prime minister will take on the criticisms of him in Chilcot - criticisms he has seen but the wider public has not.  Like all other witnesses to the inquiry he won't see the full 6,000 pages until the day itself and will then face more searching questions about how the decision to go to war was taken.	politics

"They don't feel that anyone listens to them, never mind speaks for them," opposition whip Conor McGinn said.  He said the challenge facing leader, and Islington MP, Jeremy Corbyn was to relate to the rest of the UK.  Mr McGinn also warned that Labour could lose votes if it adopted an anti-nuclear weapons stance.  A review of the party's defence policy is under way. The Labour leader opposes Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system, but many of his MPs support its renewal.  Mr McGinn, who falls in to the latter category, warned: "Defence might not win you a lot of votes, but it can definitely lose you a lot of votes if you're not in the right place on it."  In an interview with Parliament's House magazine, Mr McGinn, MP for St Helens North, said: "I think there is a political crisis that has engulfed what would be seen as the traditional Labour working class. They don't feel that anyone listens to them, never mind speaks for them.  "And I think that's a real problem for the Labour Party particularly. Sometimes it can seem that we're preoccupied with things that are insignificant to the population."  Labour, he said, needed to appeal to ordinary voters if it wanted to win elections.  "I think when you lose an election you should look at the reasons why and try, within the parameters of your own values, to move closer to the public, not further away from the public."  He also set out what he saw as the "challenge" for Mr Corbyn, who after 30 years as a backbench MP representing the London constituency of Islington North was elected party leader in September 2015.  "I love London, and it's a fantastic city, and Islington is a great place," he said, "but it's not like the rest of the country".  "I think the challenge for Jeremy having been an MP for 30-odd years for a seat like Islington, is how he relates to the rest of the country," he added.  The MP also said many people wanted a secure job with a decent wage that enabled him to afford his own home, and an annual holiday or a new car.  "The problem with sections of the left is that they sneer at people like that," he said.  He added: "There is a patrician socialism that not only wants to tell working class people what's best for them, but what they should and shouldn't think.  "I think if we are to have a genuine revival in the politics of the left, then we need to start listening to people and hearing their truths."	politics

Speaking at the agency's annual World Health Assembly, Dr Chan said experts had "dropped the ball" in the 1970s with regards to getting a handle on disease-carrying insects.  More than 60 countries and territories now have continuing Zika transmission.  Most recently, the infection, spread by mosquito bites, reached Africa.  Experts predict the same strain could reach Europe in the summer.  The virus is thought to cause serious birth defects during pregnancy and has been declared a global public health emergency.  According to Dr Chan, outbreaks that become emergencies always reveal specific weaknesses in affected countries and illuminate the fault lines in our collective preparedness.  "Zika reveals an extreme consequence of the failure to provide universal access to sexual and family planning services," she said.  Dr Chan added that Latin America and the Caribbean, which have been hit hard by Zika, have the highest proportion of unintended pregnancies in the world.  Microcephaly: 'It's not the end of the world' Life for a girl who has the condition  What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread  Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do  The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect  Above all, she said the spread of Zika was "the price being paid for a massive policy failure that dropped the ball on mosquito control in the 1970s".  Eradication campaigns were successful in the Americas with 18 countries getting rid of the insect by 1962.  But insecticide resistance plus a lack of political will led to the Aedes aegypti mosquito rebounding.  "With no vaccines and no reliable and widely available diagnostic tests, to protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice.  "Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission," said Dr Chan.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36357232	What should we be eating?	With yet more conflicting advice about what makes for a healthy diet, what should we be eating to stay well?  The UK government recently reviewed its recommendations on what foods and drinks count towards a balanced diet, by looking at the available evidence.  The Eatwell Guide lists the five main food groups that we should be putting on our plates, and the things we should limit or avoid.  Fat is a vital part of our diets. We need to eat it to keep healthy - but we shouldn't have too much of it.  In the Eatwell Guide, fat includes oils, spreads and butter.  Unsaturated fats - olive oil and vegetable oil - are dubbed as healthier than saturated fats, such as lard, ghee and butter. But not everyone agrees.  Some argue that it is better to reach for the butter than get too fixated on the type of fat you eat. Just make sure you don't eat tonnes of it.  Fat comes from other parts of the diet too.  Milk, cheese and yoghurt often contain fat - but they are also good sources of protein and some vitamins as well as calcium, which is good for our bones. In the Eatwell guide they make up about a sixth of the food we should eat.  Some dairy foods, even if they are low fat, may be loaded with added sugar.  Ideally, go for lower fat and lower sugar products, such as plain yoghurt.  This is another controversial food group which has been a source of conflict between diet advisors.  Some say there has been too big a focus on starchy foods such as pasta, bread and potatoes and that too much of these foods can cause blood sugar to rise, increasing the risk of diabetes.  The government says starchy foods are a good source of energy and should make up just over a third of the food we eat.  It says we should opt for high-fibre, wholegrain varieties - such as brown rice and jacket potatoes.  This is the category of food that we should eat the most of - yet many of us still aren't getting enough fruit and vegetables.  They should make up over a third of the food we eat each day because they are packed with vitamins, minerals and fibre. While there is no exact formula, aim to eat at least five portions a day and you can choose from fresh or frozen.  Take care with tinned, dried or juiced fruit because it can contain a lot of sugar. That's why you should limit fruit juice or smoothies to no more than 150ml a day.  Meat is an obvious choice, but fish, beans, pulses, eggs and nuts, as well as tofu and bean curd, are other sources of protein.  Again, think about what else the food contains - meat can be fatty or processed and some tinned beans can be covered in sugary sauce.  Try to go for lean cuts of meat rather than pies or pate.  Although oily fish, such as salmon and sardines, is very good for us we should not eat more than four portions a week. Oily fish can contain low levels of pollutants from the sea that can build up in the body if we eat too much.  The obvious treats and snacks to limit or cut down on are things like cakes, chocolate, crisps and sugary soft drinks.  There are lots of processed foods that contain high amounts of salt, fat and sugar, but it is not always immediately obvious to the consumer.  Check the nutritional labels on sauces, ready meals, breakfast cereals and sandwiches to help you choose healthier options.  In real life, products often contain a mix of different food groups. For example, a meat pizza will contain carbohydrates, fat and protein as well as sugar and salt.  Preparing food yourself from scratch may be time consuming, but it lets you know what you are putting in your recipe and your mouth.  Adults should drink about six to eight cups of water a day. Tea and coffee can count towards this.  Fruit juice can also count, but have no more than a glass a day because it will also contain sugar.  Alcohol is not included in the Eatwell Guide. It is high in sugar.  The government says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to around six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.  The Eatwell Guide contains a chart of guideline daily energy requirements for children, men and women.  How much energy you need will depend on how big and how active you are. As a general guide, men should get around 2,500kcal per day from the food they eat and women around 2,000kcal.  Most pre-packaged foods will list the calories on the nutrition label.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36343005	Thousands of pharmacies in England 'at risk of closure'	Thousands of local pharmacies in England are at risk of closure because of cuts by the Department of Health, a campaign group has said.  Pharmacy Voice, which represents High Street chemists, says that without access to a community pharmacist one in four people would visit their busy local GP instead.  But the government says outlets in some areas are too close together.  It proposes giving more people access to a community pharmacy.  The Department of Health in England says the average community pharmacist receives about £220,000 in NHS funding each year.  It also says too many chemists are too close to each other, with 40% located in clusters of three or more within a 10-minute walk of each other.  As a result, the government proposes cutting the amount of funding some receive, which would reduce its bill by £170m.  The number of pharmacies has grown by a fifth since 2003.  Under the proposals, more NHS funds would be provided to certain pharmacies to make sure everyone has access to a community pharmacy.  Pharmacy Voice says its members play a key role in providing community healthcare, and relieve pressure on hard-pressed GPs.  It says the government plans would mean the closure of up to 3,000 community pharmacists, particularly in deprived areas where there is a higher concentration of shops, but also where the need for their services is greatest.  Prof Rob Darracott, chief executive of Pharmacy Voice, said: "People are increasingly aware of the role a local pharmacy plays in not just dispensing their medicines, but in dispensing vital health services.  "Advising and helping people to treat minor ailments is a starting point, but increasingly, pharmacy is playing a key role in helping people lead healthier lives through interventions like smoking cessation and weight management programmes.  "These are important stepping stones to increasing life expectancy in some of our most disadvantaged communities.  "Losing a local pharmacy in these areas is simply not an option."  About 80-90% of an average High Street pharmacy's funding comes from the NHS.  A public consultation on the proposals closes on Tuesday.  Dr Keith Ridge, chief pharmaceutical officer in England, said community pharmacies were a vital part of the health and care system.  "That's why we are consulting on changes that will better integrate pharmacy into the NHS. We are looking at ways to make greater use of the skills of pharmacists in GP surgeries, A&E, care homes and other settings, and make better use of technology.  "These proposals will ensure we have a modern, efficient pharmacy sector which gives patients the support of pharmacy services when and where they need it."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36345768	Public Health England: Advice to eat more fat 'irresponsible'	Advice to eat more fat is irresponsible and potentially deadly, Public Health England's chief nutritionist has said.  Dr Alison Tedstone was responding to a report by the National Obesity Forum, which had suggested eating fat could help cut obesity and type 2 diabetes.  The charity had said promoting low-fat food has had "disastrous health consequences" and should be reversed.  Other experts have also criticised the recommendation to eat more fat, saying the report cherry-picked evidence.  Low-fat or high-fat - does it matter?  Is butter back and is sat fat good?  Dr Aseem Malhotra, a senior adviser to the National Obesity Forum, said: "The change in dietary advice to promote low fat foods is perhaps the biggest mistake in modern medical history.  "We must urgently change the message to the public to reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes. Eat fat to get slim, don't fear fat, fat is your friend."  Dr Tedstone responded by saying: "In the face of all the evidence, calling for people to eat more fat, cut out carbs and ignore calories is irresponsible."  She said thousands of scientific studies were considered as part of the official guidance adopted throughout the UK, whereas the National Obesity Forum quoted just 43 studies, some of which were comment pieces.  She added: "It's a risk to the nation's health when potentially influential voices suggest people should eat a high fat diet, especially saturated fat. Too much saturated fat in the diet increases the risk of raised cholesterol, a route to heart disease and possible death."  The report also said humans had evolved to be a "healthy well-nourished species with a long life expectancy", but this had gone wrong in the past 30 years.  It said there was too much focus on calories when "it is highly irrelevant how many calories a portion of food on a plate contains" and it was "untrue" that excessive calories caused obesity.  Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said the report was "good, bad and ugly".  He backed calls to cut snacking, but said eating more fat as a cure for obesity and type 2 diabetes was "not warranted" by the evidence and would have "adverse" consequences.  He said the authors had been selective in their choice of evidence and had ignored "an abundant literature which goes against their conclusions".  The government's obesity adviser Prof Susan Jebb said the "current dietary advice is based on the best evidence we have".  She said the debate should be widened from a focus on fat. "We're eating too many calories - if we want to tackle obesity people do need to eat fewer calories [and] that means less fat and less sugar."  The Faculty of Public Health's Prof Simon Capewell said the focus on nutritional guidelines was "a huge distraction from the real causes of obesity" such as advertising cheap junk food to children.  And he said he was worried that the National Obesity Forum report "is not peer reviewed and does not indicate who wrote it or how it was funded".  The National Obesity Forum says it is an independent organisation that receives professional and financial support from the food industry, pharmaceutical companies and medical bodies.  Prof Tom Sanders from King's College London said: "It is not helpful to slag off the sensible dietary advice.  "The harsh criticism of current dietary guidelines meted out in this report is not justified as few people adhere to these guidelines anyway.  "There is good evidence that those that do follow the guidelines have less weight gain and better health outcomes."	health

Addressing activists, he called for a "mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment".  He said a Labour government would break from the "failed economic orthodoxy".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.  At Labour's "state of the economy" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to "deliver the new economy that this country needs".  "An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society," went on Mr Corbyn.  "An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment."  Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  "Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. "A new economics."  He said: "Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared."  Having survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch.  Mr Corbyn called it "a new economics". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the "fundamental business of reforming capitalism".  So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.  No one can doubt their ambition: "I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform," the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS.  But to do that, they have to win the next general election.  Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough for that to happen? And, if they do, can they sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?  In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money.  "We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances," he said.  Councils would be given the power to limit "skyrocketing" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people "at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market".  The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.  They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.  Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.  Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.  The "local rent regulation" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.  The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to "pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.  Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was "creating a bigger and better private rented sector".  "These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent," she said.	politics

BBC News political correspondent Chris Mason said the shadow chancellor was seeking to take on critics that have suggested the party is only ever capable of grumbling about the government, rather than setting out an alternative.  But he said, coming four years before the next general election, the speech was big on vision, but short on detail.  The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.  They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.

Mr McDonnell said there would be a new "forum" for elected mayors who are in charge of cities across the country.  "For the first time, national economic policy making will be influenced directly by local decision makers representing their metropolises and their local communities," he told the conference.  The forum will look for solutions to the "housing crisis" with Labour favouring an extension of local authority-guaranteed mortgages.  Mr McDonnell said he wanted to see more local authorities following the examples of Manchester, Warrington and Sandwell by "offering cheap, local authority-backed mortgages to first-time buyers in particular".  He criticised the workings of the government's Help to Buy scheme, saying it was not targeted at people who need assistance the most.  "Labour would make it a mission to ensure that families and young people on ordinary incomes aren't locked out of home-ownership," he said.  He said new council homes would be a "top priority", funded by savings in the Housing Benefit bill.  The shadow chancellor said Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had relied too heavily on tax revenues from financial services, and public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure projects, and did not do enough to clamp down on tax evasion and avoidance .  "It helped create an unfair tax system," he said.  But he said in opposition, the party was holding the Conservatives to account and a future Labour government would ensure the UK would "no longer act like a tax haven for the super-rich".  Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was "creating a bigger and better private rented sector".  She added: "The vast majority of tenants across the country are seeing their rents remain stable, and are happy with the service they receive from landlords.  "These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36344771	Donald Trump says he has been asked to visit Downing Street	US presidential hopeful Donald Trump says he has been asked to visit Downing Street - and expects to "do just fine" with Prime Minister David Cameron.  But No 10 said while it was traditional to meet US candidates visiting the UK, no invitations had been issued.  A spokeswoman said there were "no confirmed dates" for visits as party nominees had not yet been chosen.  The PM previously called Mr Trump's proposal for a ban on Muslims entering the US "stupid, divisive and wrong".  Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  While it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination.  A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July.  Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics.  Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."  Downing Street has since said the PM stands by his criticism of but will work with whoever is elected US president.  In an interview with US news channel MSNBC, Mr Trump said: "I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine."  He added: "But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it."  Speaking on Friday, Mr Trump said he had been invited to Downing Street two days ago.  Downing Street said: "It's long-standing practice for the PM to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visit the UK.  "Given the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this."	politics

The WHO said it was concerned that the latest strain was spreading and was "on the doorstep of Africa".  It is currently circulating in Cape Verde, an archipelago off the north west coast of Africa.  Zika has been linked to neurological disorders including babies being born with small brains.  Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said: "This information will help African countries to re-evaluate their level of risk and adapt and increase their levels of preparedness."  She said African countries should raise awareness among pregnant women of the complications with the Zika virus and encourage people to protect themselves against mosquito bites and sexual transmission.  But she said she would not recommend strict travel restrictions to try to stop the spread of the disease.  There have been more than 7,000 suspected cases of Zika in Cape Verde, with 180 pregnant women thought to have been infected. The WHO says three babies have been born brain damaged with microcephaly.  Until the virus was sequenced by scientists in Senegal, it was not certain if the outbreak in Cape Verde was caused by the African or Asian type, which has hit Brazil and other Latin American countries.  Tests show that this is the Asian strain - the same as the one blamed for birth abnormalities in Brazil.  There have been around 1,300 confirmed cases of microcephaly - babies born with small brains - in Brazil, with thousands more under investigation.  A UK researcher said the Zika virus has been circulating at a low level in African countries for more than 50 years, so some of the population may already be immune.  "It is likely that the South American, Caribbean and Polynesian populations had no prior immunity to the virus, so a high proportion of people who are bitten by infected mosquitos caught the disease," said Dr Anna Checkley, of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London Hospitals.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36333850	More mental health patients sent hundreds of miles	Nearly 5,500 mental health patients in England had to travel out of their area last year because of a lack of hospital beds, new figures show.  Some patients had to travel nearly 300 miles, while one trust had to declare a major incident.  The figures, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, are 13% higher than last year.  Care minister Alistair Burt said the problem was unacceptable and promised to stop it within five years.  Being sent "out of area" for treatment means a patient being cared for in a unit not run by the trust whose care they are under.  It can occasionally be appropriate to send a patient outside their area if they need highly-specialised care, but experts say that routinely sending people away can increase the risk of suicide - and there have been repeated calls for the practice to be stopped.  But these figures, obtained by BBC News and Community Care magazine, show the problem is getting worse.  In 2014-15, 4,804 patients were treated out of area; in 2015-16 that figure had risen to 5,411 - a rise of 12.6% (according to data from 42 of 56 trusts).  Data from 28 trusts going back to 2011 shows the ever-worsening scale of the problem. In 2011-12 those trusts placed 1,215 patients out of area - in 2015-16 that had risen to 4,093, a rise of 236%.  Jessica Wilson has suffered from mental health problems for several years, including post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder.  Last December, the 21-year-old, from Louth, in Lincolnshire, became ill and needed a hospital bed. None was available locally and she was sent to Roehampton in London - 170 miles from home.  "When I found out they were looking in Nottingham, I cried," says Jessica. "So when I found out I was going to Roehampton, it was a nightmare.  "It made me feel more scared, more vulnerable, more alone and totally confused."  Jessica spent three weeks in London. While she praises the care she received there, the distance meant neither her mother nor her local mental health team could visit.  "It was really hard for me," she says. "As part of my recovery, I feel my family need to be involved.  "So not seeing them, not being able to talk to them like I normally would, really affected me. I think if I'd been closer to home, my recovery would have been a lot stronger and a lot [quicker]."  The distances some patients had to travel include:  Sue Scarborough's son was 15 when he was sent away from his home in Hull for treatment in Northumberland. She had to travel five hours to visit him, and describes the situation as having been "terrible".  "He just thought that I'd left him and I wasn't going to see him any more. He'd never heard of Northumberland and didn't know why he was there and what he was being treated for, which was appalling really.  "I could only visit on a weekend because of the distance, I don't drive. It was just disgusting."  Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that sending people long distances for treatment was an "intolerable practice" and one he wanted to see banned.  "If you're in that setting, separated from your family, it actually prevents you from recovering properly.  "This would never happen with a stroke patient, or one with a heart problem. It's a discrimination, at the heart of our NHS, against people with mental ill health."  Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said that, despite repeated commitments from government and the NHS to improve the care of people in crisis, the rise in numbers of travelling patients was "truly a sorry state of affairs".  She added: "It costs more to do things badly, and the human cost is far greater. People with mental health problems deserve better.  "A mental-health crisis is an emergency just like a physical health emergency, and no-one should be expected to put up with a second rate service for either."  NHS England has repeatedly said it is committed to improving mental-health services, but the use of out-of-area beds has worsened every year since it was created.  It has been told by ministers to aim to eradicate the problem within five years.  In January, Lancashire Care NHS Trust had to declare a major incident because of a lack of beds. It had to place 94 patients in out-of-area beds, while another 26 were waiting to be admitted.  "It's an unprecedented decision for a mental health trust to declare a major incident," says Sue Moore, chief operating officer at the trust.  "There is a lot of time spent focusing on the crisis in [accident and emergency].  "We had to really draw everyone's attention to the fact that there was a crisis here within mental health and it needed everyone to participate to mitigate that."  By declaring a major incident, Lancashire Care could suspend some planned activities and focus on the crisis, redeploying staff to help move people ready to be discharged and supporting those who had to be admitted.  The trust opened 22 beds - 10 in an assessment ward and 12 by partnering with a housing association that provided accommodation to patients still in hospital due to homelessness.  The effect has been dramatic, says Mrs Moore. There are currently just 20 patients in hospital beds out of Lancashire.  Mr Burt said it was "unacceptable that too many patients suffering from mental illness are receiving care so far from home".  "We have increased mental health funding to £11.7bn, have accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care must be eliminated by 2020-21, and will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," he added.	health

Figures obtained by BBC News and the online journal Community Care, show the number of mental health patients in England who had to travel outside their local area to get care has risen by 13% over the past year.  Some patients are being forced to travel nearly 500km (300 miles) in moments of crisis to get to the nearest bed.  The Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to Laura Nuttall, who last year was sent more than 150km (100 miles) from home for mental health treatment and Sue Scarborough, whose son was sent more than 240km (150 miles) away for care.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36341235	Patients 'could suffer' as NHS trusts bust budgets	Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.  The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.  They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out.  Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was "simply not sustainable".  "We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care."  The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service.  There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.  Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS "could not be bleaker".  "The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.  "There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached."  Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?  Financial problems 'endemic in the NHS'  Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.  However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.  The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.  Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.  When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Three-quarters of hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.  Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.  But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.  This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.  If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.  Taken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.  That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.  Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was "cooking up accounting alchemy" by "turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury".  He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs.  A Department of Health spokesman said: "The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."  He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎  "We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff," he added.  The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.  It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36334496	Huge hospital overspend to be revealed	An unprecedented overspend by hospitals and other NHS trusts is expected to be announced later by health bosses.  The figures for England from the regulator, NHS Improvement, cover the 2015-16 year, which finished in March.  By December - the three-quarter mark - hospital, ambulance and mental health trusts were already £2.2bn in the red, with the figure expected to have risen.  Overspending on agency staff has been highlighted as a major problem, as well as rising demand for services.  Experts are warning the pressure the overspend puts hospitals under has an impact on care.  Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?  Financial problems 'endemic in the NHS'  The figures account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover GPs, training budgets, public health budgets held by councils or any unspent money held by local health managers.  That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.  But the expected overspend still has the potential to impact on services.  This year the NHS is getting £3.8bn extra as part of the spending review settlement.  Some £1.8bn has already been set aside for hospitals to cover their deficits, but anything in excess of that will mean they will be under more pressure to make savings as the year goes on.  A hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was "cooking up accounting alchemy" by "turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury".  He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of investment spending into day-to-day running costs.  He said: "The so-called capital to revenue transfer may well be a legitimate accounting adjustment at the margins of the NHS accounts.  "But I have grave concerns that it is being used on a scale of hundreds of millions of pounds in more than 80 trusts. The cash is being washed through hospitals' accounts as 'income' merely to improve the bottom line."  A Department of Health spokesman said: "We are committed to the NHS and are investing £10bn in its own plan for the future - but it is vital that money is accounted for consistently.  "The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading.‎  "We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff."  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said concerns over accounting practices were a symptom of unprecedented demand on the NHS.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There's no doubt that the pressure this year is much greater than it has ever been, and that therefore each individual finance director and each individual board is having to make a decision about what they believe is appropriate."  But he added that the practices were "a perfectly ordinary thing to do".  David Bennett, a former chief executive of Monitor, the regulator of the NHS in England which is now part of NHS Improvement, said the Department of Health had to find a way of funding the deficit.  "For certain, they will be scrambling around trying to find every little budget elsewhere that has underspent to try and make sure the numbers all add up".  Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.  But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.

"There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached."  She also said capital budgets - money which has been set aside for building projects and maintenance - were being raided.  When the three-quarter year figures were released, just seven of the 138 hospital trusts were in surplus.  Last year NHS trusts finished over £800m in the red - with the health service as a whole balancing the books only after a cash injection from the Treasury and by raiding the capital budget.  The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.  It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service.  Figures in Scotland have yet to be published, although NHS Lothian, the second largest health board, has an expected overspend of £20.9m.  Meanwhile, ministers in Wales have predicted the NHS will break even.	health

Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers.  A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.  During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits.  Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention - an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation.  Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions.  Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.  It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords.  "We're defeating the government more often than is good for us," a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?  Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation.  My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.  It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.  So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight.  "There's no point in us existing," he told me, "if we don't vote for the things we believe in."  That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened.  In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems; in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247.  Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election.  "The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords," he says.  Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place.  "It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is," says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.  He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a "spurious" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time.  He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.  I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons.  Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake.  The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.  "We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event," he said.  It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled.  Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.  As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government.  It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36229822	Are there still taboos around childbirth?	Most of us know of a mother whose birth plan ended up in the bin - her baby born via an emergency Caesarean or her labour induced - or cases where complications after delivery led to a mother fighting for her life.  Susan Wray, professor of physiology and director of the Centre for Better Births at the University of Liverpool, says the truth is that the birth plans won't work if we don't know what makes birth work - and for that we need to fund reproductive research.  Where is the work asking why pregnancies and labours go wrong?  What are the biological or inherent causes of pregnancies and births going wrong, causing disability and death.  The crucial issue is not just the woeful lack of funding available to really make inroads into the causes of these conditions, but more worryingly, that research is not even part of the discussion and thus, not part of any plan.  With few researchers working to tackle the root causes, it is not surprising that the public seems accustomed to stoic acceptance of poor and sometimes tragic outcomes.  In turn this lack of scientific questioning affects funding into how we can prevent or treat adverse outcomes in pregnancy and labour.  Last year, the Medical Research Council, the funder of biomedical science from the public purse, spent just 2.4% of its budget on reproductive health and child birth.  With overall success rates of less than 20%, researchers in areas that are on the fringes, such as reproductive health, are likely to find fewer supporters around the table.  A "nothing succeeds like success" mentality does not fit reproductive and childbirth research, and thus priority and fresh initiatives and research calls for funding this area need to be brought into place.  If the public funding looks slim, charitable funding rates are even lower.  The annual report from the Association of Medical Research Charities, the body which represents the medical research charities, shows that less than 1% of the money distributed is spent on reproductive research.  Why are reproductive charities such as WellBeing of Women and Action Medical Research not the recipients of huge amounts of public generosity?  I think the lack of awareness that with research we can help more women have better pregnancies and deliveries, plays a part.  It may be worth asking if there are still taboos in the public's mind around childbirth.  We are sympathetic to heart, lung or liver failure, but why not so to uterine failure? Surely in 21st century Britain we should by now understand as much about the organs that start life as much as those that support it.  One thing is very clear - this lack of research funding cannot be explained by a lack of need.  Across England and Wales over 55,000 babies were born too early in 2014. Preterm birth is common, affecting around 8% of pregnancies and is the leading cause of death in newborn babies, as well increasing the likelihood of serious long-term health problems to the baby.  Yet we are largely in the dark about preventing it.  Over 100,000 women (E&W too?) will have births that need medical or surgical intervention.  The leading cause of emergency C-sections is that the muscle of the uterus gets tired- this is dangerous because without the muscle contracting, the baby cannot be delivered through the birth canal.  There is just one drug, which was introduced 50 years ago, that can be offered to help women suffering these labours, which are termed failure to progress.  And that one drug works only half the time.  We can neither predict which women will have these difficult labours, nor which will not respond to the drug, and need surgery.  Such labours are common, affecting one in 10 births and can be enormously traumatic for the women involved.  Many often decide against subsequent children or elect to have a C-section, with its small but nevertheless real risk.  Only awareness and more funding for research in these areas can start to make these stark figures better, and make women's birth plans less of a wish list.  Mothers will have choice only when we improve the scientific base to understand difficult pregnancies and births, and increase the chances of them being able to have the healthy birth they want for their baby.	health

Philip Blewett was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease in 2013 at the age of 64.  George, his older brother, says he was living a very full life - "you would hardly have known about the diagnosis".  Philip was living on his own, happily managing his own affairs. He also enjoyed travelling to Upton Park to watch his beloved West Ham play football and was in regular contact with his family.  At the same time he was voluntarily attending a memory clinic and taking medication to control his condition.  When he was hit by a delivery van while crossing a busy road in east London in April 2014, Philip was rushed to hospital with serious injuries, including severe head trauma, broken ribs, a broken vertebra and cuts.  A CT scan showed he had suffered a 'severe traumatic brain injury' but instead of receiving urgent treatment in a neurological ward, which was recommended at the time, he was later transferred to an assessment ward for dementia patients where his condition deteriorated rapidly.  His family believe he was 'written off' as a dementia patient, which meant he wasn't given the rehabilitation treatment he needed to recover from his brain injuries.  George explained: "If he'd been treated early for his brain injury, everything would have been so different.  "He was let down badly."  His family became increasingly concerned by the care he was receiving.  Early on, Philip wandered out of the general hospital in his dressing gown and found his way home. Thanks to the actions of his window cleaner he was safely returned to hospital, but the family were unaware of the incident until they bumped into the window cleaner several weeks later.  When he was moved to the dementia assessment ward, Philip's physical and mental condition worsened - he started having seizures, his behaviour became erratic and confused and he lost a lot of weight. On two occasions he was treated for severe dehydration.  By this time his family were frustrated and distressed by the complete lack of neurological assessments or rehabilitation, despite the diagnosis of a serious brain injury.  After getting law firm Fieldfisher on board, Philip's family were finally able to fund his move to a medical centre for neuro-rehabilitation, but the delay meant the opportunity for recovery had already been missed and Philip died earlier this year, unable to walk or talk.  Lilian Blewett, Philip's sister-in-law, said he - and the family - went through two years of torment.  She said the family was determined to confront the injustice of Philip's treatment.  "He was discriminated against because he was responsible enough to be holding a dementia card in his wallet after he was diagnosed with slight memory issues.  "But the card actually hindered him. They dismissed him and didn't take his care seriously.  "It was just tunnel vision - they looked at his dementia and didn't look at anything else," she says.  "It took a long time for people to recognise he had a severe traumatic brain injury."  And she says it wasn't just the NHS which was slow to respond to the family's requests for information after the road accident.  The police have since apologised to the family for not investigating the road traffic incident properly or prosecuting the van driver involved.  The family believe the police simply jumped to the conclusion that Philip was to blame for the incident.  With legal help, the family eventually received compensation from the driver's insurers which helped to pay for Philip's care.  The NHS trusts which treated him investigated his care after the family complained. In their response, East London NHS Foundation Trust said that although Mr Blewett's Alzheimer's was mild, doctors were of the opinion that it would reduce the chances of a full recovery from his brain injury.  A spokesman for the Trust said: "We recognise that this would have been a very difficult and challenging time for the Blewett family.  "A complaint was submitted on behalf of Philip Blewett which the Trust responded to in July 2015. The Trust takes all complaints seriously and consequently undertook a thorough investigation into the issues raised. The findings of the investigation were shared with the family."  Dr Dominic Healey, consultant neurologist at UCL Hospital Trust, who gave his expert opinion on the case, said: "In contrast to most patients' recovery following a traumatic brain injury, Philip's condition did not improve and instead, over the following weeks it deteriorated progressively, rapidly and relentlessly."  Jill Greenfield, lawyer for the family at Fieldfisher, said Philip's family was not listened to.  "Time needs to be taken to look through patient records, to look at the whole person and to listen to the family. It's so easy for quick assumptions to be made."  A recent report from the Alzheimer's Society found that too many people with dementia were receiving unacceptable care while in hospital.  Kathryn Smith, director of operations at the Society said: "Among some clinicians, there seems to be a lingering perception that people with dementia can't be rehabilitated. The upshot of this is that their other medical conditions are not treated with the same urgency.  "Good dementia care should never be a gamble, yet time and again we hear of people with dementia seemingly being deprioritised."  She added: "Poor care can have devastating, life-changing consequences. For people with dementia in hospital, it can mean the difference between returning to your own home or never going home at all."  Both George and Lilian Blewett believe there is a complete lack of understanding about dementia by people in authority in the NHS.  "He was put in the wrong place; he didn't see the right people and he didn't receive the right help.  "If we can't speak up for him, who is going to?" says Lilian.

Research suggests the brain struggles to cope with the body's change in height during a sudden growth spurt.  The boys walk clumsily for a while as their brain adjusts, say Italian scientists.  Adolescents who grow slowly and steadily remain more coordinated, a team at the University of Bologna found in a study.  Lead researcher Dr Maria Cristina said a sudden increase in height affects the body's ability to control established motor skills, such as walking.  "Adolescents tend to show previous control of the body when growing up, but the motor control behaviour is organised on the body's dimensions," she said.  "Following a growth spurt, the body needs time to adjust to changes to the periphery, during which time a teenager may walk awkwardly, while teenagers who grow steadily are able to handle growth modifications better and so maintain smoothness and regularity when walking."  They divided them into two groups - boys who grew more than 3cm over the three-month study period and those who grew only 1cm or less.  They then analysed aspects of gait, including balance, the ability to walk smoothly and regularity of stride.  The boys walked back and forth along a corridor with wireless sensors strapped to their backs and legs, and were asked to perform a mental arithmetic task while walking.  Boys who had not had a growth spurt walked more smoothly and their stride was more regular compared with the other group, the scientists found.  The research is published in the open access journal BioMedical Engineering OnLine.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36321394	Global antibiotics 'revolution' needed	A global revolution in the use of antimicrobials is needed, according to a government backed report.  Lord Jim O'Neill, who led the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, said a campaign was needed to stop people treating antibiotics like sweets.  It is the first recommendation in the global plan for preventing medicine "being cast back into the dark ages".  The report has received a mixed response with some concerned that it does not go far enough.  Superbugs, resistant to antimicrobials, are estimated to account for 700,000 deaths each year.  But modelling up to the year 2050, by Rand Europe and auditors KPMG, suggests 10 million people could die each year - equivalent to one every three seconds.  The report brings together eight previous interim reports that recommended:  The review said the economic case for action "was clear" and could be paid for using a small cut of the current health budgets of countries or through extra taxes on pharmaceutical companies not investing in antibiotic research.  Lord Jim O'Neill, the economist who led the global review, said: "We need to inform in different ways, all over the world, why it's crucial we stop treating our antibiotics like sweets.  "If we don't solve the problem we are heading to the dark ages, we will have a lot of people dying.  "We have made some pretty challenging recommendations which require everybody to get out of the comfort zone, because if we don't then we aren't going to be able to solve this problem."  It is hoped the measures will prevent more people going through experiences like Emily Morris from Milton Keynes.  She has regular urinary tract infections that do not respond to some antibiotics and could cause kidney damage or even death.  She says: "With every sting and every pain, my heart sinks at the thought of how many antibiotics I have left to use this time.  "I've had the struggle of living with a resistance to antibiotics for nearly eight years of my life...there is a clear need for new antibiotics."  Exactly how to encourage the drugs industry to make new antibiotics has been a long running problem - there has not been a new class of antibiotics discovered since the 1980s.  A new antibiotic would be kept on the shelf for use in emergencies so a company could never make back its huge research and development costs.  John Rex, from the antibiotics unit at AstraZeneca, said a new way of paying for drugs, as proposed in the report, was needed.  He argued: "Such models should recognise antibiotics as the healthcare equivalent of the fire extinguisher - they must be available on the wall at all times and have value even when used only infrequently."  But Dr Grania Brigden, from the charity Médecins Sans Frontières, said: "This report is an important first step in addressing this broad market failure, it does not go far enough."  MSF said infections resistant to drugs were a threat to their work around the world from the war-wounded in Jordan to newborns in Niger.  Dr Brigden added: "The O'Neill report proposes considerable new funding to overcome the failures of pharmaceutical research and development, but the proposals do not necessarily ensure access to either existing tools or emerging new products.  "Instead, in some cases, the report's solution is simply to subsidise higher prices rather than trying to overcome them."	health

It was announced on Wednesday that the two sides had reached a deal after talks at conciliation service Acas.  The terms will now be put to a vote of more than 40,000 BMA members in June.  But there are fears at the union that the profession could reject the deal despite it believing it is the "best and final" way out of the row.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called it a "historic agreement" and a "win-win" for the government and junior doctors.  And a host of NHS leaders have already come out to urge junior doctors sign up to it, but there has been some negative reaction on social media from frontline doctors.  The British Medical Association has said it will be urging members to accept the terms and will be explaining why in a series of road shows with the profession in the coming weeks once the full contract is published.  The revamped contract includes several major changes from the one which the government announced in February it would be imposing. These include:  BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said: "What has been agreed is a good deal for junior doctors and will ensure that they can continue to deliver high-quality care for patients."  But behind the scenes there is a concern the BMA may not be able to convince the profession and it could be an "uphill struggle" given the strength of feeling among the frontline.  There is also frustration at what the BMA sees as aggressive briefing from government following the announcement on Wednesday.  The fact that something has been agreed is a major breakthrough, but this dispute is still a long way from being over. The problem the BMA faces is that emotions are running so high.  The profession has been incredibly united throughout. Some 98% voted in favour of taking strike action last autumn and whenever union leaders have taken soundings since, the overwhelming sense has been that doctors have wanted to fight on. If this hadn't been the case the leadership would probably have agreed a deal long before now.  The BMA leadership is hoping as the weeks pass and they get a chance to explain the contract and doctors read it for themselves ahead of the vote they will come to share the view that it is the best way forward. Perhaps not better (in terms of weekend pay) than the existing contract, but at the very least an improvement on what was going to be imposed.  Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health president Prof Neena Modi, who was one of the most vocal critics of the government's decision to impose the contract, said she wanted to see a "positive outcome" in the vote.  And Stephen Dalton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, adding "we very much hope" doctors support the new package.  The government has refused to be drawn on what it will do if doctors reject the deal, although it did not rule out imposing it.  Mr Hunt told the BBC the deal was "very good for doctors", while the government had secured its "important red lines for delivering a safer seven-day service".  Asked if he took some responsibility for lengthy dispute, he said: "I don't think you can go through what we've been through in the last 10 months and say that everyone hasn't got lessons to learn, including the health secretary."  Mr Hunt said he understood there was a "lot of anger" about issues which "extend well beyond their contract", such as training.  Speaking later in the House of Commons, he said the dispute had been a "matter of great regret".  Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said the deal proved an agreement had been "possible all along".  "It's sad that it took an all-out strike of junior doctors to get the government back to the table," she said.

Mr Balls, a minister in former Labour PM Gordon Brown's government and shadow chancellor under Ed Miliband, lost his seat at the 2015 general election.  The book is billed as a "brave and revelatory account" of his time on the Labour front bench.  Mr Balls has recently kept out of the limelight - until he entered the fray in the EU referendum debate this week.  The former shadow cabinet minister shared a platform with Chancellor George Osborne and former Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable to campaign for a Remain vote on 23 June.  Mr Balls' book, called Speaking Out - Lessons In Life And Politics, will come out on 8 September - two weeks before Jeremy Corbyn's second conference as Labour leader.  Publishers Hutchinson said: "Speaking Out is a brave and revelatory account by an influential thinker and an extraordinary politician.  "It is a project that is unique in its candour, eloquence and range: a reckoning, a record of a remarkable career and a rallying cry."  The publishers said Mr Balls would use the book to talk about "victory and failure: about the mistakes made, change delivered and personalities encountered over the course of two decades at the frontline of British politics".

Educating children through dementia awareness programmes in schools is, she says the best way to improve understanding of the disease and support those who develop it.  Finding out that these days most people over 50 are more concerned about, even frightened of dementia than they are of cancer, heart disease or stroke, comes as something of a surprise.  Not because it isn't an unpleasant and heart breaking disease, because it is. But because, 10 years or so ago, dementia was an illness that most people knew very little about and as a result, quite frankly, rarely talked about at all - and certainly not in public on television, radio or in the national press.  There was a stigma attached to the disease which meant that people affected by it personally, or through their nearest and dearest, were all too often embarrassed to admit that their own, or a loved one's change of character, bad tempered outbursts, and loss of memory, weren't just the signs of a doddery or eccentric old age, but a severe illness that was affecting their brain.  As a result too many dementia patients were never diagnosed, and often spent lonely and isolated lives, retreating to a world on a parallel universe where the past had more relevance than the present and the closest of family and friends became frightening and unrecognised strangers.  Fortunately, attitudes are changing. And about time too.  Living with dementia - click here to see BBC coverage  With initiatives like the Alzheimer's Society's drive to create Dementia Friends and Dementia Friendly Communities all over the country, several million people are now far more familiar with the symptoms of the disease, and how to support dementia patients and their carers to ensure that they can live well with the disease within society.  One of the most exciting initiatives that's been running for four years now, is the introduction of dementia awareness programmes to schools throughout the county .  Young people have no hang ups about the disease. The word stigma does not appear in their dementia dictionary.  Once they know what dementia is, and the effect it's likely to have on a grandparent or older family member or friend, most of them just accept it and embrace the way the symptoms manifest themselves without fear or judgement .  When I hear from a seven-year-old boy, writing about his grandfather who has dementia, saying that "I love going out with my granddad. He says and does daft things - but we have a great time". Or the 12 year old girl declaring that "The day my nan was diagnosed with dementia, we all got it. Because dementia is a team event" I want to shout for joy. Because kids get it.  Currently some 500 senior and primary schools throughout the UK are working on a whole range of projects that bring them into direct contact with the disease and those affected by it.  I'd love to see even more schools getting involved and recognising the value of this work.  Because the knowledge and experience they are gaining is helping to build an entire dementia friendly generation of young people, for whom the disease will hold few fears or anxieties.  Youngsters who will take that knowledge and understanding into maturity into the workplace and their social circles.  They will recognise the symptoms, if and when they occur, in parents, friends, loved ones, even perhaps in themselves and ensure that the disease is diagnosed early enough to benefit from whatever medical interventions will be available in the years ahead.  Some of the senior students who began as the young pioneers in the first schools to embrace the curriculum four years ago have even based their career choices on their knowledge joining the medical profession or social services to specialise in dementia.  They could even become the generation that finally discovers a cure.  But most importantly - and hopefully, unlike the 50-plus-year-olds of today - they will grow up as an entire dementia friendly generation knowing not to fear dementia, but how to fight it.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36324895	Colon cancers 'more deadly on right'	Cancers are more deadly if they develop on the right side of the colon, a study suggests.  Data on more than 1,000 patients, released ahead of the world's biggest cancer conference, showed a 14-month gulf in survival rates.  Doctors said location was probably a marker for a fundamentally different type of tumour.  And that separate treatments should be tailored for those on the left and right sides.  The study, to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference, shows patients with advanced bowel cancer survived 33 months on chemotherapy if the tumour was on the left.  And just 14 months if it was on the right.  Dr Richard Goldberg, one of the researchers, from Ohio State University, told the BBC News website: "It was somewhat surprising the cancer on the right side had worse outcomes than on the left, regardless of what they were treated with."  There was also a marked difference in how the tumours responded to different drugs.  The study showed Cetuximab was more helpful on the left-sided tumours, while Bevacizumab had an advantage on the right.  "There is potential for this to evolve into a practice-changing finding," said Dr Goldberg.  Studies have already shown that bowel cancer is four distinct diseases - each of which has a separate prognosis.  Dr Alan Venook, from the University of California San Francisco, said: "I think we'll be able to find [these] different versions distributed across the colon.  "We believe the side is really a surrogate marker for some biological explanation, and we're hoping to tease that out over the next few months."  One possible explanation for the difference between the left- and right- sided cancers goes back as far as the womb.  In the embryo stage of human development, the colon's left side is built from the hind-gut and the right from the mid-gut.  So different parts of the colon have distinct origins, which could still be affecting the risk of cancer 60 years later, the researchers suggest.  Colorectal cancer causes nearly 700,000 deaths around the world each year.	health

Oxford University scientists say though doctors are already advised to give the drug, the benefits of taking it early on have been "hugely underestimated" and treatment is sometimes delayed.  Writing in the Lancet, they call for clearer medical and public guidelines.  NHS England says it will carefully consider the findings of the study.  Minor strokes and TIAs (transient ischaemic attacks or mini-strokes) occur when there is an interruption of blood flow to the brain - they can cause weakness to the limbs or problems with speech or vision and symptoms usually disappear within days.  But the chance of going on to have a major stroke - with more permanent symptoms - is higher in the days after an attack.  Previous studies have suggested aspirin plays some part in reducing this, particularly in the long-term.  But the team of scientists say their findings show most of the benefit lies in the first crucial hours and days after a minor stroke or TIA.  They estimate taking early aspirin treatment at this point could reduce the risk of having a major stroke from one in 20 people per day to one in 100.  Lead researcher Prof Peter Rothwell said the benefits of immediate aspirin therapy had been "hugely underestimated".  He added: "We need to encourage people, if they think they've had some neurological symptoms that might be a minor stroke or TIA, to take aspirin immediately, as well as ideally seeking medical attention."  Transient ischaemic attacks (also known as mini-strokes) - symptoms resolve within 24 hours but the majority resolve within 10-60 minutes.  Minor stroke - symptoms last more than 24 hours but often resolve within a few days - and are usually relatively mild  Major stroke - usually taken to mean some permanent symptoms remain  Researchers now call for medical services - including paramedics and NHS helplines - to recommend the drug as soon as possible if a TIA is suspected.  Meanwhile they say it is essential that patients who have a minor stroke are not just sent home from the emergency department with advice to add aspirin on to their next prescription.  The team reviewed data from 15 trials, involving thousands of people who had taken aspirin immediately after a stroke or as long-term treatment to prevent a second one.  Dr Dale Webb, at the Stroke Association charity, described the trial as an exciting development.  He added: "However, it's important to note that taking aspirin is not an alternative to seeking medical attention. Anyone who thinks they are having a TIA should always call 999 immediately.  "And the findings suggest that anyone who has stroke symptoms, which are improving while they are awaiting urgent medical attention can, if they are able, take aspirin."  Meanwhile Tony Rudd, National Clinical Director for Stroke at NHS England, said:"This report contains important data that will need to be carefully considered and then, if needed, appropriate changes made to guidelines for the management of acute stroke and transient ischemic attack."  Health experts suggest in general aspirin should not be taken without medical advice if people have bleeding disorders or swallowing problems and should be considered with caution if someone has asthma, for example.  New stroke guidelines for doctors are due out in the autumn.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36318353	Queen's Speech: Prison shake-up at heart of new laws	The government's planned new laws have been set out by the Queen - including the biggest prison shake-up in England and Wales "since Victorian times".  Satellite-tagging will be used and re-offending league tables published.  There is also support for a spaceport and driverless cars - but a planned British Bill of Rights is on hold.  EU Out campaigners criticised the absence of a promised Sovereignty Bill and said legislation had been "watered down" because of June's referendum.  But David Cameron said it was a "bold" and "radical" agenda.  He told MPs: "This is a Queen's Speech that combines economic security with extending life chances for all, it's the Queen's Speech of a progressive, one nation Conservative government."  But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, giving his response in the Commons, accused Mr Cameron of turning a blind eye to the "consequences" of cuts to public services, branding his government a "driverless car heading in the wrong direction".  He added: "This government is failing to deliver an economy that meets the needs and aspirations of the people that sent us here - a government that is consistently failing to meet its own economic targets.  "They have failed on the deficit, failed on the debt, failed on productivity, failed to rebalance the economy."  He said the government had been "forced to back down" on a series of proposals in recent months - most recently on forced academisation of all England's schools - and predicted that many of the bills announced would never reach the statute book.  The gold shone bright as ever. The gleaming horses trotted in traditional time.  But the biggest event of Parliament's year felt like an impeccably choreographed, grandly produced, historically faithful sideshow.  The only hint of change in the ceremony - the monarch, for the first time, taking the lift.  David Cameron's hope for today was to create a coherent sense of his remaining ambitions, help for those he believes politics has left behind.  For his critics it takes some convincing, particularly in a time of cuts, to give that any credence.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said policies such as the planned renewal of Trident nuclear weapons, a continued squeeze on public spending and signals of "yet more cuts to welfare" were at odds with the Scottish government's "progressive agenda".  The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament, a tradition that can be traced back to 1536.  For the first time, the Queen used a lift rather than a flight of stairs when she arrived at the Houses of Parliament in what Buckingham Palace said was a "modest adjustment to arrangements" made "for the Queen's comfort".  Other measures in the 21-Bill programme include:  The government is also pushing ahead with controversial plans to monitor internet use through its Investigatory Powers Bill and crack down on extremism, including stronger powers to disrupt radicals' activities and to intervene in unregulated schools which are "teaching hate".  The Queen's Speech is being seen as an attempt to secure a legacy of social reform for the prime minister but critics say it is overshadowed by 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU, which has split the Cabinet.  Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused the government of abandoning plans for a Sovereignty Bill, promised earlier this year, to reassert the supremacy of the UK Parliament.  He accused David Cameron of "jettisoning or watering down" key elements of legislation in a "helter-skelter pursuit" to win the referendum.  UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall described the Queen's Speech as "light on major announcements," adding that some Conservative MPs had been "convinced to support Cameron's decision to support the 'Remain' side by promises of a Sovereignty Bill, and they must now feel utterly betrayed by the man they're whipped into cheerleading".  The Queen made only the briefest of direct references to her government holding "a referendum on membership of the European Union".  But - in a move that may be seen as an attempt to reassure voters ahead of the EU referendum - she added: "My ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons."  The planned prison reforms, drawn up by Justice Secretary and leading Leave campaigner Michael Gove, were billed as the centrepiece of the Speech.  Mr Cameron told MPs: "For too long in our country the young offender institutions and prisons have not been working. They give the public the security of knowing that offenders are locked in but they're not doing enough to turn around the lives of people who will one day be let out.  "So in our prisons we are going to apply the lessons learned in other public service reforms - publishing results, giving the people who run the services proper control over them, encouraging innovation, rewarding success and not tolerating persistent failure."  He rejected claims by Green MP Caroline Lucas that the reforms would be undermined by big cuts to prison budgets and overcrowding, saying the government's "whole aim was to try and do more with less".  One of Europe's biggest jails, HMP Wandsworth, is among six institutions where governors will be given new powers over budgets and setting the daily regime.  Satellite tracking tags which monitor the movements of offenders using GPS technology will be piloted in eight police areas from September, in a move which could see prisoners become weekend inmates and spend the rest of the week at home as they hold down jobs.  Prisons will also be forced to publish statistics on education, reoffending and inmates' employment on release.  According to The Guardian, the government will also adopt the findings of a review of education in prisons, which will recommend allowing inmates to use iPads in their cells to "learn independently" and stay in touch with friends and family via Skype.	politics

Government negotiators and the British Medical Association leadership have reached an agreement after eight days of talks at conciliation service Acas.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal was a "significant step forward", while the BMA said it represented the "best and final way" to end the row.  The offer will now be put to a vote of over 40,000 BMA members.  That means it could still end up being rejected, but the fact the union and government have agreed a deal to end the stalemate is a major breakthrough.  These talks were seen as the last chance to get an agreement and were set up after a series of strikes, including the first-ever full walk-out by doctors.  It comes after the government announced in February it would be imposing the contract from this summer after previous talks failed.  The details released on Wednesday include several major changes:  BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said he was pleased to have reached a deal after "intense but constructive talks", adding it was the "best and final way" of resolving the dispute.  "Junior doctors have always wanted to agree a safe and fair contract, one that recognises and values the contribution junior doctors make to the NHS, addresses the recruitment and retention crisis in parts of the NHS and provides the basis for delivering a world-class health service.  "What has been agreed today delivers on these principles, is a good deal for junior doctors and will ensure that they can continue to deliver high-quality care for patients."  He said he would be recommending the deal to junior doctors ahead of the vote of BMA members, which will be run in June.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We welcome this significant agreement which delivers important changes to the junior doctors' contract necessary to deliver a safer seven-day NHS.  "The talks have been constructive and positive and highlighted many areas outside the contract where further work is necessary to value the vital role of junior doctors and improve the training and support they are given.  "This deal represents a definitive step forward for patients, for doctors and for the NHS as a whole."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36324835	Andy Burnham to run for Manchester mayor role	Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham will put himself forward to become the mayor of Greater Manchester.  Mr Burnham told the Guardian the role was "a cabinet-level job, which needs cabinet-level experience".  The Leigh MP said Westminster had "become a bit of an irrelevance for some people" adding that "we really need to change the way politics works".  The first elections for the role, currently filled by interim mayor Tony Lloyd, will be held in 2017.  Mr Lloyd and another former Labour minister, Ivan Lewis, are also seeking Labour's nomination.  Mr Burnham, the former health secretary, had been expected to announce his candidacy on Thursday but his intentions became clear when one of his Twitter profiles was rebranded as "Andy4Manchester".  As a national political figure over many years, Andy Burnham will be seen as the first genuine big hitter to throw his name in the hat to become Greater Manchester mayor.  The Leigh MP's move will be read by many as him giving up on a Labour return to government in 2020, but it's also a sign of the shift in power from Westminster to the North West.  Mr Burnham wasn't part of any negotiation for devolution to Greater Manchester and he was completely taken by surprise by the deal to merge health and social care, claiming the area was taking responsibility for an "NHS funding crisis" rather than anything else.  But time passes quickly in politics and Mr Burnham now sees opportunity where he once predicted disaster.  He'll be up against two well-established candidates for Labour who have spent months visiting local party groups to garner support.  He may find that being a big player in the national game doesn't particularly endear you to those who've stayed home to hold the fort but he's a formidable addition to the panel Labour members will eventually choose from.  The race to be the mayor of Greater Manchester has just got a bit more interesting.  Powerful regional mayors are a key part of the government's drive to devolve more responsibility to local authorities for Whitehall.  About 2.7 million people live in Greater Manchester, which has been at the forefront of the devolution project under the "Northern Powerhouse" banner.  Among the new powers transferred to the new mayor - who will also hold the office of police and crime commissioner - are responsibility for a £300m housing investment fund and control of transport budgets.  The leaders of the 10 councils that make up the Greater Manchester Combined Authority will form part of the new mayor's cabinet.  Another shadow cabinet minister Luciana Berger, recently said she was considering running for the new "metro mayor" role in the Liverpool area.  Speaking to The Guardian, Mr Burnham rejected the suggestion his decision showed he did not think Labour could win the 2020 general election, saying the party could "gain strength" from the powers being given to cities.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36321276	Plans to give prison governors control welcomed	New powers to allow some prisons to set their own rules and budgets and decide how to rehabilitate inmates have been widely welcomed after being outlined in the Queen's Speech.  Governors at six "reform prisons" in England will be given direct control.  Such freedoms for governors should be part of a modern justice system, the Prison Reform Trust said.  But the government must also address "real problems within prisons", the Prison Officers' Association warned.  Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, welcomed the government's new focus.  "For far too long prisons have been our most neglected, least visible public service," she said.  "More freedom for governors, long overdue access to modern IT, sensible plans for release on temporary licence and constructive use of tagging to curtail liberty should all be part of a modern justice system."  But she stressed the most pressing priority was to restore prison safety and stem a "catastrophic rise" in suicides, violence and disorder.  "Reform will run into the sand unless government is prepared to tackle prison numbers and introduce major sentencing reform as part of its groundbreaking Prisons Bill," she said.  Under the Prisons and Courts Reform Bill:  The prime minister first outlined plans to give prison governors "complete control" over their prisons in February.  The education plans follow an independent review of prison education by former head teacher Dame Sally Coates.  The prison reform plans were first outlined by David Cameron in February - and the concerns remain the same now as they were then.  How can such changes have a meaningful impact on rehabilitation, education and reoffending when so many jails are struggling simply to maintain order and stability?  If successful, the greater freedom governors will have, and the incentives on offer for improved performance, may help drive down recidivism levels and, as a result, reduce the overall prison population.  But there are so many factors that affect whether a prisoner steers clear of crime after release - family support, housing, employment to name a few - that there can be no guarantee that the changes to the way prisons are managed will be successful.  The Prison Officers' Association, the sector's union, said it was "still questioning" what freedom for governors really meant.  But it said it would "engage" with any new freedoms. Prison regimes had to tackle the "unprecedented" rise in violence, self-harming and deaths, a statement said.  Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed more autonomy for governors but said the success of the reforms would depend on the government driving down prisoner numbers.  The Prison Governors' Association said most governors were in favour of having greater autonomy but some feared that, without increased resources in prisons, they could be "held accountable for matters outside of their control".  Labour's shadow justice secretary, Charles Falconer, said the government had failed "every time" at reforming prisons in the past.  Instead prisons have become "dangerously overcrowded with rising levels of violence, drug abuse and serious assaults on staff", he said.  Of the six prisons pinpointed, inspectors have warned that Ranby prison is at risk of being overwhelmed by the supply of legal highs. A a prisoner was murdered at Coldingley in April.  Chief inspector: 'Some prisons not fit for purpose'  Rapt, a charity which helps prisoners give up drugs and crime, welcomed the changes but said it was "critical" to improve education and tackle the issues of drugs, mental health and violence.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36320826	Zika virus may reach Europe this summer	The Zika virus could spread to Europe this summer, although the likelihood of an outbreak is low to moderate, the World Health Organization has said.  Areas most at risk are those where Aedes mosquitoes may spread the virus, like the Black Sea coast of Russia and Georgia and the island of Madeira.  Countries with a moderate risk include France, Spain, Italy and Greece, while the risk in the UK is low.  The UN agency is not issuing any new travel advice at this time.  The WHO is calling on countries to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and to make sure that people - particularly pregnant women - have information on the potential harmful consequences of the disease.  The agency says most countries that could be affected are well prepared to pick up any new cases and deal with them quickly - but others must bolster their ability to diagnose the virus.  Zika has been linked to a rise in brain defects in babies and the virus has been seen in more than 50 countries during this outbreak.  And WHO experts say the risk of spread increases in late spring and summer as Aedes mosquitoes - thought to carry the virus - become more active.  The report suggests 18 countries are at moderate likelihood of seeing Zika cases while the UK is one of 36 countries which have a low, very low or no likelihood of transmission.  Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, at the WHO, said: "We call particularly on countries at higher risk to strengthen their national capacities and prioritise the activities that will prevent a large Zika outbreak."  The report weighed up many different factors to calculate the likelihood of spread, including the presence of Aedes mosquitoes, the climate and whether countries had the capacity to deal with Zika and stop transmission.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36320413	Queen's Speech: EU vote awkward backdrop to PM's plans	So Parliament's show of the year is here - the full regalia of state has seen Westminster bursting into colour.  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee state coach made its way to the Palace of Westminster carrying the Imperial State Crown before both houses came together for her speech.  It is a moment when the unity of state is on very purposeful display.  But after the gilded regalia is gone and the red carpets are stripped away a more prosaic political reality returns.  Her Majesty's Government is drawn from a party with a small majority locked into public division over an EU referendum with the potential to decide the fate of her prime minister and members of the cabinet.  In press released comments to accompany the speech, David Cameron said the government's legislative programme involved "difficult choices" and "big and bold reforms".  But those reforms are likely to be a little less difficult and perhaps a touch smaller and less bold than they might otherwise be - because the wrong referendum result has the potential to terminate the prime minister's oversight of all of them.  This is a moment when Mr Cameron can ill afford controversies over planned legislation or public spats with his own backbenchers threatening to rebel over upcoming bills.  It is striking that some of the most heavily trailed parts of the Queen's Speech are those that have the effect of promoting the government's desire to be seen as compassionate.  The programme sees legislation introduced "to tackle some of the deepest social problems in society, and improve life chances".  The planned laws involve changes to adoption and social work designed to lift children out of poverty and prison reform for "changed and reformed lives" for offenders.  The prominence given to these announcements follows a series of damaging climb downs in which critics accused ministers of having to be forced to take the compassionate argument in the face of threatened backbench rebellions.  Take the recent changes of heart by the government - which has a working majority of just 17 - over housing child refugees from Europe or over planned welfare cuts for the disabled.  The latter involved the resignation of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who after a fierce battle with the Treasury left behind him excoriating comments suggesting the government had lost its way in helping the poorest.  Of course, Mr Duncan Smith - who opposes Britain's membership of the EU - leads us back to the prime minister's bigger battle - the referendum. The campaign has split the Conservative Party and is becoming increasingly embittered with rows having the potential to bleed through into other areas of policymaking.  The government's plans for a "British" Bill of Rights is one such area likely to become a battleground for the competing sides in the EU debate.  The proposal formed a meagre eleven words towards the end of the Queen's Speech with little additional detail from the government - other than to say the rights would be based on those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), while taking into account UK laws. The lack of detail may help avoid a potentially explosive row over the bill - for now.  But Mr Duncan Smith has attacked David Cameron for abandoning other key legislation, citing a failure to include a planned Sovereignty Bill to re-assert the supremacy of the UK Parliament.  It is another sign of how hard it can be during the campaign to disentangle the usual process of government from the deepening divisions over the referendum.  But despite the challenges for the government, the speech does contain some striking and potentially controversial measures.  Proposals to privatise the Land Registry will provoke a fierce response from unions, which have already raised concerns over thousands of jobs.  The Counter-Extremism and Safeguarding Bill includes stronger powers to disrupt radicals' activities and is likely to provoke strong debate.  The Prison and Courts Reform Bill gives new powers to prison governors to control their own jails, which the government claims is the "biggest reform of our prisons since Victorian times".  The former Home Secretary Michael Howard says all this shows the government "is not distracted by the referendum". That's despite his own opposition to the government's position on remaining within the EU.  These are awkward times indeed for the government - but ones from which attention is deflected for one morning only, thanks to the gleaming regalia of the Queen's Speech.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32816450	Queen's Speech: What is it and why is it important?	The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament. It is one of the highlights of the Parliamentary year, full of both pageantry and political significance.  What is the Queen's Speech?  In a nutshell, it is a list of the laws that the government hopes to get approved by Parliament over the coming year. By convention, it is announced by the Sovereign in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords.  The occasion marks the start of the Parliamentary year and has added resonance after a change of government, with the contents of the Speech highlighting the priorities of new ministers and setting the scene for Parliamentary battle ahead.  Has there always been a Queen's Speech?  Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th Century. The current ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was re-opened after the fire of 1834.  There is normally one Queen's Speech every year, although the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one in 2011, arguing that its legislative programme was so extensive that it would require two years to implement. The coalition government also decided to switch the State Opening from its traditional November date to the Spring.  Does The Queen write the Speech?  No. It is written by ministers but is delivered by the Sovereign from the throne of the House of Lords on behalf of Her Majesty's government.  The Speech varies in length from year to year, depending on the number of actual bills and other items - such as draft legislation and foreign policy objectives - included but normally takes about 10 minutes.  The Queen, to whom the document is sent beforehand for signing, also uses the occasion to give details of upcoming visits to the UK by other heads of state and any state visits she is making overseas.  Does The Queen come every year?  Pretty much but not quite. This will be the 65th time during her reign that she has delivered the Speech. She has been absent on two occasions, in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant. On those occasions, the Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor.  Is there a lot of pomp and ceremony involved?  Yes. The State Opening begins with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry - an event which always draws large crowds along the route.  The Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.  The House of Lords official known as 'Black Rod' is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy.  Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech.  The speech itself is carried into the Chamber by the Lord Chancellor in a satchel. He hands the speech to the Sovereign and takes possession of it again once it has been delivered.  Until a few years ago, the Speech was written on a rare form of calf's skin known as vellum. It is now written on high-quality parchment paper.  What happens after the Speech?  The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace while MPs and peers break for lunch. A couple of hours later MPs reassemble in the Commons to begin debating the Speech.  After introductory speeches by two MPs - traditionally one a relative newcomer and the other a long-serving member - the prime minister gets to his feet to "sell" the Speech to the Commons, explaining what is in it and what it says about his vision for the country and the changes he wants to make.  The leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond before backbenchers chip in. The debate on what is known as the "Humble Address" normally lasts about five days, with a largely symbolic vote taking place at the end.  Members of the House of Lords also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.  It is in the Queen's Speech. That means it will happen?  Not necessarily. The Queen's Speech is the equivalent of the government's "mission statement" for the year ahead but that does not mean everything in it will become law.  There are plenty of examples of proposed legislation that falls by the wayside due to political opposition.  A recent high-profile example was a bill proposing elections to the House of Lords in 2012, which was withdrawn four months after being announced by the coalition government.  In contrast, there are bills which are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech which are subsequently introduced in response to changing circumstances.  Traditionally, the first Queen's Speech of a new Parliament tends to contain more bills than later ones as ministers seek to capitalise on the momentum of their party's election victory, at a time when the opposition is often at its most divided.	politics

Age UK says one in seven of the "oldest old" - an estimated 417,000 people in all - now provides some sort of unpaid care to family or friends.  Over half of these clock up more than 35 hours a week.  Many are exhausted and say they worry about how long they might be able to carry on, says the charity.  The findings come from a yearly, representative household survey of 15,000 people aged 60 and older. The results were multiplied to give an estimate for the whole of the UK.  In 2009, an estimated 301,000 people in their 80s were carers. That figure has now risen by nearly 40%, largely due to an ageing population but partly due to a lack of state support, says Age UK.  Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: "The task of providing care ought to be fairly shared between individuals, families and the state, but as public funding falls further and further behind the growing demand for care, we worry that very old people are being expected to fill the gap. They can't do it all on their own and we shouldn't take advantage of their determination to do right by those they love."  The charity Carers UK called for extra investment in social care services and the NHS to meeting the increasing demand.  The Department of Health is currently consulting on how it can improve support for carers. People have until 30 June 2016 to submit their views.  Community and Social Care Minister Alistair Burt said: "We owe a great deal to the love and determination of older carers.  "I want to make sure the government does everything it can to support them. That is why I am calling on carers and their supporters up and down the country to let us know how we can make a difference."  Caring can involve anything from help with washing and dressing to looking after people with dementia.  The government says caring for others should not be to the detriment of the carer's own health and wellbeing and carers can receive support in a number of ways - including from social services, the NHS, or the benefit system.

Baroness Royall said people may "change their views" and should be able to apply to rejoin the party.  Her inquiry into anti-Semitism claims at Oxford University Labour Club found no evidence of institutional racism.  But it said "difficulties" had to be addressed to ensure a "safe space" for all Labour students.  A wider inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, led by civil rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, is under way.  A Labour spokeswoman said the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC) accepted the report but shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he disagreed with Baroness Royall, saying the party had to be "extremely firm" on any kind of racism.  He told BBC Newsnight: "I don't want these people to be members of our party, so we have a difference of view on that."  Asked if Ken Livingstone could ever be a member of the party again, following comments he made regarding Hitler and Zionism, Mr McDonnell insisted he would not prejudge the outcome of the wider inquiry.  He added that Baroness Royall's report would now go before the NEC and would influence future policies.  Labour has been beset by growing claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks in recent months, and critics have accused the leadership of not doing enough to combat the problem.  Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the party has been "resolute" in tackling anti-Semitism and that he has taken "decisive action" over any allegations since he became leader.  Baroness Royall, whose review began before Ms Chakrabarti's was launched, said her recommendations should apply to Labour as a whole in its response to any instances of anti-Semitism.  On banning members, she said: "It is not recommended that where a person is excluded from membership for anti-Semitism this should automatically be a life ban.  "I recognise that people may change their views and that where that is demonstrable a person may be allowed to seek NEC approval for any future application to join the Labour Party."  Her investigation was launched after Alex Chalmers resigned as co-chairman of Oxford University's Labour Club (OULC) after it voted to support Israel Apartheid Week. He said many members had "some kind of problem with Jews".  In a statement the club said at the time: "We are horrified at and whole-heartedly condemn anti-Semitic behaviour in all its forms."  Labour MP John Mann said in a tweet that the report showed there "definitely is" a problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.  Setting out her conclusion, Baroness Royall said: "I do not believe that there is institutional racism within OULC.  "Difficulties, however, face OULC which must be addressed to ensure a safe space for all Labour students to debate and campaign around the great ideas of our movement."  Ms Chakrabarti's inquiry, set up after MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone were suspended amid anti-Semitism claims, will report by the end of June.  Lady Royall said it should consider whether Labour should change its rules to allow swifter action to deal with anti-Semitism, to empower the NEC with an independent panel to exclude members where there is evidence of anti-Semitism and to introduce more rigorous vetting procedures for candidates.	politics

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Monday, Mr Trump said: "It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows.  "I hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either."  But that is not stopping ministers and diplomats quietly preparing for Mr Trump to visit the UK in the coming months.  The mood in Whitehall is that the government must now prepare for the possibility that Mr Trump could be the next US president and efforts need to be made to repair relations with the millionaire property magnate.  In 2012, the then Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited the UK and caused some offence by suggesting Britain was not ready for the Olympic Games.  On Tuesday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan invited Mr Trump to visit him and his family in London to learn about Islam.  He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "If I can educate the presumptive Republican presidential nominee about Islam, I'm happy to do so."  Government sources say they have been struggling for months to convince parts of Whitehall to take Mr Trump seriously. And they say it is possible his potential rival, Hillary Clinton, could face indictment over the alleged use of private email for government business.  One source described Mr Trump as a political tsunami sweeping up blue collar workers, while Mrs Clinton had not tried to do anything different.  So diplomats are now trying to build a relationship with Mr Trump's team and get ready for the moment they come to the UK.  A petition advocating a ban on Mr Trump coming to the UK after his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering US following the San Bernardino shootings in California in December attracted 574,000 signatures.  In a Commons debate, Labour MP Paul Flynn said barring him from the UK risked being seen as anti-American, but SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said a ban would be justified on the grounds of "religious harmony".	politics

Mr Khan gained 44.2% of first preference votes to Conservative Zac Goldsmith's 35.0%, but how did support for the two men break down at neighbourhood level?  The map below shows how voters in London's wards used their first preference vote for mayor.  In the 630 neighbourhoods mapped, Labour took the majority of the votes in 388. The Conservatives were the strongest party in 242 wards.  Labour and the Conservatives dominated the contest - no other party managed to win on first preferences in any part of London.  Khan or Goldsmith? London mapped by first preference vote share  Labour increased its support in the north and west of the city, compared with the 2012 election, and managed to take a larger share of the vote than the Conservatives in the City of London.  Khan's highest share of the vote - 76.9% - was in Little Ilford, Newham. His lowest levels of support were in Knightsbridge and Belgravia at 12.6% - which coincidentally saw the highest share for Zac Goldsmith at 76.0%.  To see how the mayoral candidates for the Conservatives, Greens, UKIP and the Lib Dems fared use the dropdown menu below.  Mr Goldsmith had the largest share of the vote in west London, as well as a large concentration of support in the north-west and the south-east. However, he struggled to do as well as Labour in much of central London.  Overall voter turnout was higher at this election than in 2012, with 45.3% of people turning out to vote. There were just two neighbourhoods that bucked the trend, both in Lambeth: Bishop's ward, where turnout fell by 4.9 percentage points, and Coldharbour, where it slipped by 1.6.  People turned out to vote in greater numbers in those parts of London that tended to favour the Conservative candidate: the northern and southern edges of the city.  At 62.0% and 59.3%, turnout was highest of all in East Sheen and Kew - two wards where Mr Goldsmith thrashed Mr Khan.  But the ward with the third-highest turnout in London, Dulwich Village, was a better bellwether for the overall result: Mr Khan overturned a majority for Boris Johnson at the last election in 2012.  The ward with the lowest proportion of people voting was Fieldway in Croydon, at 26.6%. This was up on 23.7% in 2012.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36312132	Abortion rates 'fairly constant'	Department of Health figures suggest abortion rates for England and Wales have remained "fairly constant", with 184,571 abortions in 2015.  This is an increase of 0.7% on rates for 2014, but is 0.3% lower than those recorded for 2005.  The report shows while abortion rates have fallen for women under 30, they have risen steadily for women over 30.  And the charity BPAS says it is concerned women in this age group are underestimating their fertility.  Statistics show abortion rates for women aged 30 to 34 have gone up from 14.5 per 1,000 women in 2005 to 17.1 in 2015.  And the British Pregnancy Advisory Service says one reason for the rise could be that women are getting mixed messages about conception.  Ann Furedi, chief executive of BPAS, said:"There have been increasing calls in recent years around 'educating' women on the risks of waiting to start a family and growing emphasis on the problems women may face when trying to conceive.  "We must keep these risks in perspective, as BPAS sees many women experiencing unwanted pregnancy after underestimating their ability to get pregnant - because of their age, irregular periods, or a previous sexually transmitted infection."  Meanwhile, the report shows that 38% of women who had an abortion last year had had a previous termination - this proportion has risen from 32% during the past decade.  And the number of women having repeat abortions varied across different areas of England and Wales.  Officials say this might relate to local differences in the contraceptive advice women are given after a termination.  Sexual health charity FPA, says it is important for women to be given the right support following an abortion - wherever they live.  Chief Executive Natika Halil said: "I am concerned by the Department of Health's suggestion in its report that women could experience differences in post-abortion contraceptive advice, depending on where they live.  "Support for reproductive health should never be a postcode lottery for women."  The data comes after the Royal College of Midwives faced criticism for saying women who wanted a termination should not face prosecution.  The law states that a woman can face prison if she terminates her pregnancy beyond 24 weeks without medical legal authorisation.  But the RCM said it believed abortion should be removed from the scope of criminal law.  Meanwhile, Right To Life said such measures could increase the number of abortions and lead to a rise in sex-selective terminations.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36247599	Magic mushrooms 'promising' in depression	A hallucinogenic chemical in magic mushrooms shows promise for people with untreatable depression, a short study on just 12 people hints.  Eight patients were no longer depressed after the "mystical and spiritual" experience induced by the drug.  The findings, in the Lancet Psychiatry, showed five of the patients were still depression-free after three months.  Experts cautiously welcomed the findings as "promising, but not completely compelling".  There have now been calls for the drug to be tested in larger trials.  At the start of the trial, nine of the patients had at least severe depression and three were moderately depressed.  In one patient, symptoms had lasted for 30 years.  All of them had tried at least two different treatments for depression, without success.  One had tried 11.  The study, at Imperial College London, initially gave patients a low dose of psilocybin, the hallucinogenic chemical in magic mushrooms, to test for safety.  They were then given a very high dose equivalent to "a lot of mushrooms", the researchers said.  The psychedelic experience lasted up to six hours, peaking after the first two, and was accompanied by classical music and followed by psychological support.  Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, one of the researchers, said: "These experiences with psilocybin can be incredibly profound, sometimes people have what they describe as mystical or spiritual-type experiences."  Most patients had a rapid dip in their depressive symptoms, with predictable side-effects including anxiety, nausea and headaches.  Dr Carhart-Harris said: "Seeing effect sizes of this magnitude is very promising, they are very large effect sizes in any available treatment for depression.  "We now need larger trials to understand whether the effects we saw in this study translate into long-term benefits."  Fellow researcher Prof David Nutt said thoughts could become locked in an overly self-critical and negative mode in depression, and it was thought the drug acted as a "lubricant for the mind" that "liberates" the patient.  He said psilocybin targeted the receptors in the brain that normally responded to the hormone serotonin, which was involved in mood.  However, the study is anything but clear-cut.  It is short, in a small number of people and has no placebo group.  Larger trials use dummy, sugar pills or placebos so they can account for the enigmatic "placebo effect" in which people can get better when they think they are being treated.  The researchers told the BBC "it is possible" all the improvement was down to the placebo effect although the duration of the benefit and change in outlook suggested something else was going on.  Dr Carhart-Harris said "this isn't a magic cure, we shouldn't infer too much" until larger trials had taken place.  Prof Nutt said simply being able to perform the study using the hallucinogenic drug was a "landmark", as he criticised the "Kafkaesque" restrictions that had made the research difficult.  Prof Nutt, who was fired as the government's drugs adviser for his outspoken views, said red tape had meant "it cost £1,500 to dose each patient, when in any sane world it might have cost £30".  Prof Philip Cowen, from the University of Oxford, said: "The key observation that might eventually justify the use of a drug like psilocybin in treatment-resistant depression is demonstration of sustained benefit in patients who previously have experienced years of symptoms despite conventional treatments, which makes longer-term outcomes particularly important.  "The data at three-month follow-up, a comparatively short time in patients with extensive illness duration, are promising, but not completely compelling."  The research was backed by the Beckley Foundation and the UK's Medical Research Council.	health

The shadow mental health minister and MP for Liverpool Wavertree said she was "flattered" that people had asked her to stand for the "metro mayor" role.  Another Liverpool MP, Steve Rotheram, is also considering seeking Labour's nomination, the BBC's Arif Ansari said.  Elections for mayor of the Liverpool City Region will be held in 2017.  It will cover five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton and Wirral - as well as Halton in Cheshire.  If they do choose to run, Ms Berger and Mr Rotheram would face competition for Labour's nomination from the current mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, who has already confirmed he will put himself forward.  Ms Berger added: "I will be consulting with family, friends and members of my constituency Labour Party in the coming days, before reaching a decision on whether to put my hat in the ring."  Ministers have championed the idea of regional elected mayors in exchange for the devolution of powers from Whitehall.  Labour's former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said last week he was considering putting himself forward for a similar role in Greater Manchester.	politics

Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training.  A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs.  But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS.  It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors.  NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help.  The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting.  The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them.  It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened.  Are nurses the new doctors?  Report author Candace Imison said there were "huge opportunities" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles.  And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: "Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report."  But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done "at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves".  "It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience," he said.  "There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients."  And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was "all too often" no funding for training courses.  "Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country," she added.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36299465	Natalie Bennett to step down as Green Party leader	Natalie Bennett has announced she will stand down as leader of the Green Party in England and Wales this August, after four years at the helm of the party.  Ms Bennett said she would not stand for re-election when her second two-year term in office expires this summer.  The Australian former journalist said she intended to remain "fully engaged" in the Green Party after stepping down.  Green peer Baroness Jones and London mayoral candidate Sian Berry have said they do not want the job.  Baroness Jones tweeted that she had "no leader ambitions", while Ms Berry wrote on Facebook that she "definitely will not be standing in the election for a new leader".  Ms Bennett said she had been "proud to lead a party through a period of phenomenal expansion and increased impact".  An ex-journalist who worked for the Telegraph, the Independent, the Times and the Guardian, she became party leader in September 2012.  She succeeded Caroline Lucas, the Green Party's MP for Brighton Pavilion.  Earlier this month, she defended her leadership after the Greens lost four councillors in local elections in England, and won a 2.5% share of vote in the Welsh Assembly elections, behind UKIP.  In a statement, Ms Bennett said: "With the support of our passionate members and supporters we have been able to achieve much in a relatively short period.  "There's greatly increased public understanding that when you want the honest, caring, committed view - one that isn't guided by the views of the latest focus group or fear of a tabloid backlash but by fundamental principles and values."  Ms Bennett took part in televised leaders' debates ahead of last year's general election.  Last year, she had to apologise to members following a radio interview in which she blamed "brain fade" for her inability to explain a series of party policies.  Speaking to the BBC following her decision to stand down as leader, she criticised the "soundbite" culture in politics and the media.  "I'm not smooth," she told Radio 4's World At One.  "Sometimes I get stuck for words. But what I think is, we also need to think about what kind of politics we want. Some of our political reporting is very much aggressive attacks on quite minor points, refusing to engage in the broader issues and that really doesn't do the public, the voters, any kind of favours."  Ms Bennett said she did not know who would run for Green Party leader.  Richard Mallender, chairman of the Green Party Executive, thanked Ms Bennett for "her outstanding leadership over the past four years."  Baroness Jones said it was a "really tough job" and she was "disappointed" Ms Bennett was stepping down.  "What we need now is some new people to come forward," she said. "There is incredible talent in the party who are not well known because they are not elected."  Nominations for Ms Bennett's successor will open on June 1 and close on June 30.  A campaign period will run from 1 July until 24 July, at which point a one-month balloting period will begin with the result to be announced at the party's autumn conference in Brighton in early September.	politics

The UK PM has called the Republican hopeful "stupid, divisive and wrong" over his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.  Mr Trump replied by warning he may not have a "very good relationship" with Mr Cameron if he enters the White House.  He is also involved in a spat with new London Mayor Sadiq Khan.  The US presidential contender said he would not forgive Mr Khan for calling him "ignorant" - and challenged the Mayor to take part in an IQ test, an offer mocked by Mr Khan's team.  Last year, Mr Trump, who has beaten his rivals to become the presumptive Republican candidate, called for a temporary halt to all Muslims entering the US in the wake of the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino, California.  He said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."  Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier on Monday, Mr Trump said: "It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows.  "I hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either."  Mr Trump said he was not anti-Muslim but "anti-terror", saying "we have a real problem and we have to discuss it", as he called on Muslims to work with the people and "turn people in" that they suspected of extremism.  "I have many Muslim friends," he said. "I was with one the other day, one of the most successful men, he's Muslim and he said, 'Donald you have done us such a favour, you have brought out a problem that nobody wants to talk about'."  David Cameron's official spokesman was asked about Mr Trump's suggestion that they might not have a good relationship following the Republican candidate's latest comments.  "The prime minister has made his views on Donald Trump's comments very clear. He disagrees with them and I haven't got anything further to add," said the spokesman.  "He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the US is divisive, stupid and wrong."  The Number 10 spokesman said that Mr Cameron was "committed to maintaining the special relationship" whoever wins the presidential election.  "He has been clear that he will work with whoever is president of the United States," said the spokesman.  No proposal had been made for a phone call between the prime minister and Mr Trump, but the spokesman said Downing Street would be willing to consider it.  Mr Trump also criticised what he called the "very rude statements" made about him by Sadiq Khan, after Mr Trump suggested he would make an "exception" to the ban for the London mayor.  Mr Khan, the first directly-elected Muslim mayor of a major Western capital city, dismissed Mr Trump's offer and accused the US presidential hopeful of holding "ignorant" views of Islam which "could make both our countries less safe" by playing into the hands of extremists.  Responding, Mr Trump told ITV: "I am offended, he doesn't know me.  "I think they were very rude statements and, frankly, tell him I will remember those statements," he added.  Mr Trump also challenged Mr Khan to an IQ test.  But as the public spat between the two men continued, a spokesman for Mr Khan said US voters would reject Mr Trump's "ignorant, divisive and dangerous" views.  He said there were "no plans" to seek direct talks with Mr Trump and mocked his IQ challenge, saying: "Ignorance is not the same thing as lack of intelligence."  Mr Khan, who was elected Labour mayor of London last week, told BBC News his message for Mr Trump and his advisors was" your views on Islam are ignorant".  "We've shown in London that there's nothing incompatible with being a mainstream Muslim and Western liberal values, and we showed that comprehensively on 5 May," he added.  Mr Trump, who is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party after pushing out more than a dozen rival presidential candidates during the US primary season, reiterated that he backed the UK leaving the European Union.  In contrast to US President Barack Obama, who has warned that an EU exit would leave the UK at the "back of the queue" in trade talks, Mr Trump said he did not think it would harm the UK's trade position.  "It wouldn't make any difference to me whether they were in the EU or not," he said. "They certainly wouldn't be back of the queue, that I can tell you."  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told ITV's Good Morning Britain that it "can't be good" if Mr Trump were to be elected as US president in November.  "I'd agree with that. I have huge and infinite faith in the American people that he won't be," she said.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36301030	Scientists clone Zika for vaccine race	US scientists have cloned the Zika virus - an important step towards fast-tracking a vaccine against the disease.  The man-made copy is a replica of the strain that is spreading across the Americas and has been linked to brain deformities in newborn babies.  In tests at the University of Texas, the clone could infect mosquitoes - the carrier of Zika - and cause disease in laboratory mice.  Experts say they can use this in experiments to design a good vaccine.  It is hoped a candidate will be ready for testing in the coming months.  But it could be many years before there is a safe and effective jab that can be offered to the general public.  Zika can cause serious harm to unborn babies, but it often has no visible symptoms in the mother.  Experts say a vaccine to protect expectant women, and others at high risk of infection, is one of the most effective ways we have of beating it.  Many different research groups around the world are working to make such a vaccine.  The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases hopes to start human clinical trials on its ​vaccine candidate by September.  What's needed is a "safe" version of Zika that will trigger the body to ward off the infection without actually causing the disease.  The University of Texas team say their cloned virus should help with achieving this. They have published their findings in the journal Cell Host & Microbe.  Until now, researchers had known the structure of Zika, but they had not replicated it - at least not this strain.  UK expert Dr Tom Blanchard, from Manchester University, is using a safe derivative of an existing smallpox vaccine to try to make a new antidote for Zika.  He said: "The challenge for people like us who are developing vaccines is to separate out the harmful effects of the virus from the beneficial effects. We want to have something that will replicate but will not cause damage.  "Research such as this could help."  Prof Polly Roy of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said: "This is good. Scientists have everything to play around with now."  She said that as well as designing a vaccine, researchers would also be able to test antiviral drugs that might lessen the effects of Zika if someone was already infected.	health

But she said she would investigate "without fear or favour" and her recommendations would be "mine alone".  The inquiry was set up after MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone were suspended amid anti-Semitism claims.  Islamophobia and other forms of racism will also be looked at.  The announcement of the review last month, alongside a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, came as critics claimed the party leadership was not doing enough to combat the problem.  Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, was suspended after social media posts emerged in which she suggested Israel should be moved to the United States.  Mr Livingstone was then suspended after claiming Hitler supported Zionism, as he tried to defend her.  Ms Chakrabarti was political neutral in her previous job as head of campaign group Liberty.  Explaining why she joined Labour on the day she was asked to lead the review, she said: "This is a party looking at itself in the mirror and I wanted to have the trust and confidence not just of the Labour leadership but of party members."  She said she wanted members to know the inquiry, which will report by the end of June, was "in the party's interests".  She added: "I consider myself to be independent. I do not think I am less independent for making absolutely clear that I share the values of the Labour Party constitution and will seek to promote those values in any recommendations and findings.  "It is a judgment call but I thought that was the most honest thing to do - to be clear that I was undertaking this because I do believe in the values of the Labour Party and want to see them promoted not just in the Labour Party but in the world."  Labour - along with other progressive parties - had to "openly look at itself in the mirror" and combat not only prejudice but also complacency, she added.  The inquiry will consult Labour members and supporters, as well as members of the Jewish community and other minority groups, she said, and could suggest changes to Labour's rules and procedures.  Ms Chakrabarti said she would seek submissions from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn although she could not compel anyone to give evidence.  Labour peer Baroness Royall - who is already leading a review into anti-Semitism allegations including in the Oxford University Labour Club - and Professor David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the study of anti-Semitism, will be vice chairs.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36288353	Cancer Drugs Fund changes deeply concerning, say charities	Fifteen cancer charities have said they are "deeply concerned" about new plans for approving innovative cancer medicines for the NHS in England.  In a letter to the prime minister, the charities said many drugs would "now struggle to gain approval".  The medicines regulator has rejected this and said drugs would be approved faster than anywhere else in Europe.  The dispute is over planned changes to the Cancer Drugs Fund - a special pot of money just for cancer medicines.  It currently pays for innovative drugs that have been deemed too expensive for the NHS as a whole.  It includes medicines such as Kadcyla, which initially cost £90,000 per patient, and extends the lives of women with breast cancer by six months on average.  However, the fund was a victim of its own success and has been greatly overspent.  Its costs have risen to £340m in 2015-16 from an initial annual budget of £200m when it was set up in 2011.  The new system will start in July, fixing the fund's budget at £340m.  The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will give new medicines a Yes, No or Maybe rating before they come to market.  Those given the go-ahead will be routinely offered across the NHS, while those given a Maybe rating can be considered for the Cancer Drugs Fund.  But the 15 signatories of the letter, who include the chief executives of Beating Bowel Cancer, Prostate Cancer UK and Target Ovarian Cancer, say NICE's decision making is flawed.  Their letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government introduced the Cancer Drugs Fund, says: "We are deeply concerned by the lack of reform proposed to the wider NICE process of appraising cancer medicines.  "Unfortunately the new system does not update the methodology used by NICE, introduced back in 1999, and many clinically-effective treatments will now struggle to gain approval.  "We urge you to intervene and commit to a review of the outdated mechanisms used to assess cancer medicines."  Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now and one of the signatories, told the BBC: "What I'm worried about is that very soon we're going to see cancer patients who have potentially incurable cancer missing out on modern treatments that are available in other countries or across the border in the UK."  NICE said the new system would see drugs approved for use on the NHS "earlier than any other country in Europe".  Sir Andrew Dillon, the organisation's chief executive, said: "I understand and support the ambition the charities have for access to effective cancer medicines.  "Our approach to assessing the value of new cancer drugs has been reviewed on a regular basis since we were set up in 1999 and is already more generous than for other conditions.  "It's now up to [pharmaceutical] companies to show that they recognise the challenges as well as the opportunities their new drugs present to the NHS, and show the same flexibility on cost to NICE as they have been showing to NHS England in its recent negotiations with companies for drugs already in the Cancer Drugs Fund."	health

The charity says nearly two-thirds of people fear a diagnosis would mean their life is over.  But it says an early diagnosis can actually help people to live as well as possible.  And it wants everyone to confront head-on the challenges posed by dementia.  In a survey of 2,000 adults, almost half thought they would have to stop driving immediately while one in five feared losing their partner or friends if they were diagnosed with dementia.  Nearly 60% thought they would struggle to join in conversations and almost half worried people would think they were "mad" if faced with a diagnosis.  But the charity said these myths about dementia were stopping people from getting the best possible treatment and also preventing them from planning for the future.  There are many possible symptoms of dementia, and anyone experiencing them is encouraged to see a doctor as soon as possible. Common symptoms include:  How to spot dementia in a loved one  One in three people surveyed said they didn't go and see their GP because they thought memory problems were just a natural part of the ageing process.  Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, said delays in seeking medical attention were something they wanted to change.  "Too many people are in the dark about dementia - many feel that a dementia diagnosis means someone is immediately incapable of living a normal life, while myths and misunderstandings continue to contribute to the stigma and isolation that many people will feel."  He said he wanted to reassure people that life doesn't end when dementia begins.  "There's no question that it can have a profound and devastating impact on people, their family and friends - but getting a timely diagnosis will enable people with dementia to live as well as possible."  There are around 850,000 people in the UK with a form of dementia - a figure that is predicted to rise to one million in less than 10 years and to two million by 2051.

Baroness D'Souza said the Lords "should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account".  A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October.  Lord Strathclyde, who led the review, said there was no suggestion the Lords' powers would "fundamentally change".  During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week.  In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead creating a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to "think again".  Under the recommendation, they would be allowed to do this only once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagreed.  Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: "Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for."  She said the Lords "should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear".  "There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed."  But Lord Strathclyde told Sunday Politics said there was "absolutely no suggestion" the House of Lords' powers would "fundamentally change".  He said: "I made the most mild and humble recommendation about the smallest part of the legislative process on secondary legislation, where frankly most of us had understood that the customs, practice and conventions that had been built over the course of the last 50 years would stick.  "Last October they broke down, as a result of which there is no consensus and no agreement on what those powers should be, which is why I propose not so much a diminution of the powers of the House of Lords but a new power to reject and ask the House of Commons to think again."  Lord Strathclyde added the Conservative government had faced "blocking tactics, using vetoes, rather than working with the House of Commons and the government to try to improve that legislation".  Baroness D'Souza also said she would be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords, saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807.  She said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.  The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added.  Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST.	politics

Addressing members, who include some of Labour's best-known MPs, he said he was not interested in hearing "personal abuse" but wanted the party to concentrate on "inclusive politics".  Progress was founded by Lord Mandelson to promote New Labour ideas.  It is the first time Mr Corbyn has attended its conference.  He was greeted with laughter when he said: "It is my first time speaking here.  "In fact it's the first time I've ever been invited to a Progress conference - you set a pretty high bar if you have to be elected leader of the party if you ever want to get invited here."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said it was interesting that Mr Corbyn was speaking to some of his fiercest critics - some of whom have been talking privately about trying to get rid of him as leader.  Progress has borrowed Mr Corbyn's "straight talking, honest politics" slogan for its 2016 conference in a further sign it is offering an olive branch to the Labour leader.  Mr Corbyn told members: "I don't do any kind of personal abuse.  "I don't make it and I don't respond to it because if I did I wouldn't have time to do anything else."  He said he wanted more debate as "working together the party can achieve great things".  He added: "I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.  "Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.  "Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this."  He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.  He spelt out that this meant "everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a "right-wing conservative" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.  Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: "They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.  "I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36288301	Junior doctors' contracts: Crunch talks extended	Last ditch talks to reach a deal on the junior doctors contract in England are being extended into next week.  The government and the doctors' union have agreed to continue negotiating until Wednesday.  The talks, hosted by conciliation service Acas, which started on Monday are seen as the last chance for the two sides to agree a deal.  They were set up following a series of strikes and included the first-ever full walk-out by doctors.  It comes after the government announced in February it would be imposing the contract from this summer after previous talks failed.  Discussions first started in 2012, but broke down in 2014, before Acas hosted talks at the turn of this year.  The main focus of this week's talks have been on Saturday pay, although the British Medical Association (BMA) team has also been raising other issues, including funding the government's seven-day NHS policy.  If these talks fail, the government has indicated it will push ahead with the imposition of the contract.  Hospitals are due to start sending out contracts for positions from the end of this month.  These will be for those medics graduating from medical school, but over the course of the next 12 months much of the rest of the 55,000-strong workforce will be moved on to the new terms and conditions.  Ministers have argued the new contract, which makes it cheaper to rota junior doctors at weekends, is needed to improve care.  Acas chair Sir Brendan Barber said the talks had been conducted in a "constructive and positive atmosphere" and some real progress had been made.  "This is a strictly time limited extension and represents a final opportunity to find an agreement as the basis for the resolution of this difficult dispute."  He said neither the BMA or government would be making any statement.  When it entered the talks, the government agreed to put imposition of the contract on hold, while the doctors' union suspended its threat of further industrial action.  Under the terms of the new contract, basic pay is to be increased by 13.5% on average, but other elements of the pay package are to be curbed, including what constitutes unsociable hours.  Day hours on a Saturday will be paid at a normal rate, while extra premiums that are being offered for the rest of the weekend are lower than what is currently paid.  As a result of the dispute between the government and the BMA, there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine - but not urgent care - between January and early April.  At the end of April there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36284335	Police asked to investigate Conservative election letters	Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.  The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded Devon and Cornwall Police take action.  He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.  A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.  The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.  One concluded: "The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay."  The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.  Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: "It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency.  "That has to be a local cost, not a national expense."  A Conservative spokesman said: "Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate.  "The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party.  "Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate."  Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.  He said: "The law says if you're convicted of the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP."  But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return.  The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning "battle bus".  The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an "administrative error", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.  Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.  The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred "with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election".  The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are "generally reportable" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific "facts and context".	politics

The interior designer, 56, has received undisclosed damages, an apology and reasonable legal costs from the group, it was revealed in London's High Court.  Ms Hoppen's solicitor, Henry Fox, said the group had admitted in February to unlawfully intercepting phone messages.  The group said the method - which resulted in articles between 2004 and 2006 - should never have been used.  Ms Hoppen appeared on BBC Two's Dragons' Den for two series before quitting the show in January 2015.  She is also the former stepmother of Sienna Miller, whose past relationship with fellow actor Jude Law was of huge interest to the tabloid media.  In 2011, Ms Hoppen accepted £60,000 in damages over a separate phone-hacking case involving the now-defunct News of the World.  Ms Miller's phone was also hacked by the paper and in 2011 she received £100,000 in damages.  Mr Fox said a separate claim brought against Mirror Group Newspapers by Hilary Perrin - who from 2000 to 2006 was director of regional organisation for the Labour party and also director of the London Labour Party - had also been settled with the payment of damages, costs and an apology for the damage and distress caused.  He said Ms Perrin's voicemails had been hacked in February, March and April 2004 and she was also targeted by private investigators on two occasions.  Ms Perrin had never sought publicity and was distressed to think the paper had potentially jeopardised her political career by intercepting private messages left by those who had placed their trust in her, he added.  Ms Waite said that Mirror Group Newspapers acknowledged Ms Perrin's information should never have been obtained or used in the manner it was.  Neither Ms Hoppen nor Ms Perrin were in court.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36286008	Wait for cancelled ops hits 10-year high in England	More than 5,000 NHS patients in England were not treated within 28 days of their operation being cancelled in the year to April - the highest figure for 10 years.  During the same period, nearly 75,000 NHS operations in England were postponed at the last minute - also a 10-year high, NHS figures show.  The Royal College of Surgeons said the figures were "disappointing".  It blamed pressures on A&E, staff shortages and lack of beds.  Under the NHS constitution, cancelled operations are supposed to be rescheduled within 28 days or the patient's treatment should be funded at a time and hospital of their choice.  This affects patients who have had their operation cancelled at the last minute because of non-clinical reasons, such as beds or staff being unavailable.  This would not include patients told in advance that their operations would be cancelled during three days of junior doctors' strikes in January and March.  The NHS England figures show that 6.8% of patients waited more than 28 days to be treated after their cancelled operations in 2015-16.  Clare Marx, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: "It is disappointing that the number of patients waiting for their cancelled operations to be rescheduled has hit the highest level in a decade.  "This is yet another indication of the pressure the NHS is under.  "Situations where patients have to wait longer for their treatment are highly stressful for them and their families and, in some cases, their condition could deteriorate."  She said it was vital that access to healthcare be provided at a time when patients could benefit most from the result.  Miss Marx said: "There are likely to be a number of factors behind this rise that government and the NHS need to continue to tackle including pressures in emergency departments, staffing shortages, and lack of bed availability due to rising delayed transfers of care.  "Industrial action may not have helped but the underlying causes are likely to be more strongly related to the broader pressures the NHS faces."	health

A study of 25 breeds of dog, published in PLOS Genetics, has identified three genes linked with a severe type of brain tumour known as glioma.  Future investigation may yield a better understanding of the causes and potential treatments of brain tumours in dogs and humans, researchers say.  Gliomas are very severe human brain tumours that are often incurable.  The disease can also occur in dogs, and some breeds, such as the boxer and bulldog, have an increased risk.  Genetic analysis of blood samples from dogs showed variations in three genes were linked with development of brain tumours in canines.  People have the same genes as the ones identified by the researchers in dogs.  "Researchers in the consortium are now continuing the analysis of the genes identified, and their functional roles in development and progression of glioma in both dogs and humans," said co-researcher Katarina Truve.  The researchers were able to identify a stretch of genetic code that differed between diseased and healthy dogs.  "These results indicate that further investigations of the role of these three genes in glioma development would be of interest, with potential benefit to both dog and human," said Prof Karin Forsberg Nilsson, of Uppsala University, in Sweden, who also worked on the study.	health

The aim is to find out how tumours develop and spread and what happens during the final stages of the disease.  The study, funded by Cancer Research UK, is looking for more than 500 patients to sign up.  Hospitals in Cambridge, Glasgow, Oxford, Manchester, Leicester and London are taking part and the study will be open to patients from October.  Scientists say this pioneering research will enable them to find out why tumours become resistant to treatment and potential ways to boost the immune system to fight the disease.  The study opened in London last year and, with £4m funding from CRUK, over the next five years it is hoped that hundreds of cancer patients will be recruited right across the country.  Prof Charles Swanton, scientific lead for the study at both the University College London Cancer Institute and Francis Crick Institute, said he was incredibly thankful to the patients and families who had agreed to take part.  "With their generosity, scientists can carry out research that will help save lives in the future," he said.  "Until this study, we really didn't have any way nationally to take samples from multiple sites of cancer within a patient at the end of their life.  "This study will help us complete the whole cancer picture - from diagnosis to death - that we need."  The study is only open to people with a solid tumour cancer that has spread elsewhere in the body.  The research team has already performed its first post-mortem, collecting multiple samples of cancerous tissue and normal tissue in order to compare them.  Dr Iain Foulkes, executive director for research funding at Cancer Research UK, said: "With this investment more people will be able to leave a life-changing legacy and help accelerate research that could benefit thousands of people in the future."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36275877	Inside England's only gender identity clinic for children	It is England's only clinic for children experiencing difficulties in the development of their gender identity.  The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Centre in north London has been going since 1989 but this week I became the first journalist to be allowed access to its clinical rooms and some of its staff and patients.  To look at the centre from the outside it is nothing impressive. It resembles an office block.  But what happens inside is crucial to the happiness of every child who goes in seeking help, guidance and support.  The reception area is welcoming: warm yellow walls with two smiley receptionists who are courteous in their approach. In the waiting room, there are a couple of children in school uniforms, one munching on an apple, the other staring straight ahead as if deep in thought.  The staff here understand it must be a daunting experience for any child to come and wait to speak to psychologists and psychiatrists about their innermost feelings.  They work hard to provide them with comfort through a collage of wall paintings featuring animals and other furry objects.  Up three flights of stairs, I am introduced to Dr Polly Carmichael, the woman in charge and one of the country's leading clinical psychologists in the area of transgender children.  "It's important that we make people feel welcome here," says Dr Carmichael.  "Every young person who comes to the service is an individual and it's really about getting to know them and creating a therapeutic space where it feels safe to think about all the alternatives and choices they may have."  Critics of the service often suggest an irresponsibility on behalf of the staff for talking about transgenderism to children and in some cases agreeing to the use of hormone blockers, or as they're called in the medical world, hypothalamic blockers.  Dr Carmichael rejects those criticisms: "This is a real phenomenon - there are young people who feel incredibly distressed around their gender identity and we start from a place where we accept that this is real and respected, but not one where we assume what the outcome will be, or what path that person will ultimately choose."  According to figures from the clinic, 32 children under the age of 16 were prescribed blockers last year, compared with 41 in the previous year.  The corridors are long and lined with brown doors, all leading to either a clinical space or an office. One of the rooms I'm shown has toys scattered on the floor for those patients who are particularly young - bright building blocks and cuddly animals to put them at ease.  In another room across from the lifts sits 16-year-old Colin and his mum Jane. Colin transitioned from female to male two years ago and describes himself as a gay male. I'm given permission to sit in on a session between him and child psychiatrist Dr Victoria Halt.  The purpose is to see how Colin is doing with his transition and whether he's experiencing any distress or anxiety. In Colin's case it has been a smooth ride so far and he comes across as confident, happy and content.  He begins to explain that gender and sexuality are not synonymous.  "Gender is between your ears and not what's between your legs," he says.  "I feel like your gender identity is something really innate within you and it has no correlation to your body... like when I get periods then it's just something that happens to my body - it's not like this is a woman thing, this is just a thing."  He tugs at his t-shirt to pull it away from his breasts. He tells me he's wearing a chest binder - a sort of bra that presses down on any breast tissue to create a flat-looking chest.  "It's excellent for making people perceive me and my gender correctly but it can also cause a lot of back pain and if I wear it for too long then I've known people who have broken ribs from them.  "But I would rather be in pain and uncomfortable than look like a woman."  Read more about two of the UK's youngest transgender children.  About 1,400 young people under the age of 18 have been referred to the Gender Identity Development Service over the last year.  Three children aged three were referred to the clinic in the past year, compared with none in the previous year.  Dr Carmichael says she's noticed that those transitioning are getting younger.  "Young people [are] making the full social transition - that means living full-time in their preferred gender inside and outside the home - at earlier ages," she says.  "It's something that comes through from those we've seen coming here in recent months."  At 16, someone can decide to take cross-sex hormones to look more like the gender they identify with, and at 18 can opt for surgical intervention.  Those procedures don't happen here. Patients are sent to University College London Hospital but the key decisions about what is right for them and how they should move forward are concluded in this building.  Children and their families have to wait around nine months before being seen by experts here. I meet Poppy - a nine-year-old who has transitioned from male to female and is on the waiting list.  "When I was little I used to go to my wishing well in the garden, throw some stones down there and wish I was a girl and that wish came true," she tells me.  "I didn't feel like myself as a boy and didn't feel right and something felt wrong inside. I'm so happy now."  To critics this is all about interfering with nature. But staff here insist that each case is different and that the media have created an illusion that this is happening on a mass scale when actually it is only occurring in a small proportion of the population.

The watchdog applied to the High Court to force the party to disclose the documents, as part of an investigation into an alleged spending rules breach.  Within hours, the commission said it had received the documents from the party and was reviewing them.  The allegations relate to accommodation costs of activists on its "battle bus".  The Conservative Party acknowledges that due to an "administrative error" some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.  It says the bus tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative campaign headquarters and the costs would not have breached national spending limits, as it says it was "some millions below the national spending threshold".  But others argue that spending ought to have been declared under the local campaigns, in constituencies where the battle bus and its activists visited .  On Thursday, Lincolnshire Police joined a list of police forces investigating whether election spending for candidates was not properly recorded.  The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.  The case has also led to calls for the new police and crime commissioner for Devon and Cornwall to stand aside while she is investigated over her part in the campaign.  The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said it will review allegations that Alison Hernandez failed to declare expenses as an election agent in Torbay in the 2015 election. She has denied any wrongdoing.  In a statement, the Electoral Commission said: "Using its powers under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA) 2000, and in line with its enforcement policy, the Electoral Commission may issue a statutory notice requiring any person, including a registered party, to provide us with specific documents and/or information as part of an investigation.  "This places the recipient under a legal obligation to provide the required material.  "However, if the recipient does not comply with this statutory notice, the commission may apply to the High Court for a disclosure order which if granted would be the court compelling the respondent to release the required documents and information to the commission."  The commission said the Conservatives had failed to act properly on two statutory notices requiring it to produce information - providing "limited disclosure of material in response to the first notice (issued on 18 February 2016) and no material in response to the second notice (issued on 23 March 2016)" - despite being granted extensions to the original deadlines to comply.  Prior to receiving the information, the commission's Bob Posner said: "We are today asking the court to require the party to fully disclose the documents and information we regard as necessary to effectively progress our investigation into the party's campaign spending returns."  A Conservative Party spokeswoman said the party had advised the Electoral Commission on 29 April "that we would comply with their notices" by 13:00 on 12 May.  "There was no need for them to make this application to the High Court," the spokeswoman added.	politics

Stockbroker Peter Hargreaves told Reuters the UK would "become incredibly successful" as it "will be insecure again - and insecurity is fantastic".  The Remain campaign said his comments showed Leave campaigners were "willing to risk making families worse off".  The UK was "stronger and better off" in the EU, director Will Straw said.  The UK votes on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union in a referendum on 23 June, with the economy one of the key battlegrounds in the campaign.  Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe says the UK economy will shrink and jobs will be lost if Britain withdraws from the EU - but Leave campaigners says the economy would thrive as it would be free of what it calls EU red tape and able to negotiate trade deals with other countries.  In an interview with Reuters news agency, Mr Hargreaves - who has donated £3.2m to Leave.EU, a group founded by UKIP donor Arron Banks which lost out to Vote Leave in the race for the official designation - said a vote to leave would create uncertainty in the UK.  But he argued that was what the country needed, saying it "would be the biggest stimulus to get our butts in gear that we have ever had".  "It will be like Dunkirk again," he said. "We will get out there and we will be become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic."  Mr Hargreaves, who founded investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, criticised some of the "bizarre" EU regulation Britain's financial services and business were subject to, saying it was set by people "who have never been to Britain and wouldn't know how to spell financial services".  He stepped down from the board of the company last year, but still owns a stake of more than 30%. He was speaking in a personal capacity.  Green MP Caroline Lucas, on the board of Britain Stronger In Europe - the official Remain campaign - said remaining in the EU would ensure the UK enjoyed "continued prosperity as part of Europe".  "Insecurity might be exciting for billionaire hedge fund managers like Peter Hargreaves, but for most people in Britain it risks jobs being lost, prices rising and small businesses being hit.  "It also risks our hard won rights at work and the environmental protections which keep us safe," she said.  The group's executive director, Will Straw, said Britain was "stronger, safer and better off in Europe than we would be on our own".  "These out-of-touch remarks from the Leave campaign's biggest donor show they simply do not care about the damaging consequences for people's jobs, family finances and Britain's economy," he added.	politics

The official Leave campaign had wanted one of its senior figures - Michael Gove or Boris Johnson - to take part and claimed No 10 had "set the rules".  ITV rejected claims of a "stitch up", while Mr Farage, UKIP leader, said Vote Leave should "put their egos aside".  Downing Street says the PM will not debate against other senior Tories.  A spokesman said this was because the EU referendum, on 23 June, was about much more than "who's up and who's down in the Conservative Party".  Live televised debates featured in the 2010 general election, with the three contenders for prime minister - David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg - taking part.  That format was not repeated at the 2015 general election. But after protracted discussions between Downing Street and the broadcasters Mr Cameron took part in one with seven party leaders but no head-to-head with Labour's Ed Miliband.  In the run up to the in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership, ITV plans to hold two TV specials, including an hour-long live programme in which Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will appear one after the other to separately answer questions from a studio audience.  Vote Leave is the official campaign for those wanting the UK to leave the EU - a status it was given by the Electoral Commission after it saw off a challenge from the Nigel Farage-backed Grassroots Out.  Its best known campaign figures are senior Conservatives such as Boris Johnson, Mr Gove and others like Iain Duncan Smith - and the thrust of its campaign seeks to be broader than the more immigration-focused UKIP approach.  Vote Leave's head of media, Robert Oxley, told BBC Radio 4's Today that while Mr Farage had done a "tremendous amount" in the referendum he was not the best person to win over undecided voters.  But Mr Farage disagreed, telling the BBC he could better appeal to voters in the Midlands and the north of England than Mr Johnson who he said was more suited to the "home counties".  Criticising the decision not to include one of its senior figures, a Vote Leave spokesman said ITV had allowed the prime minister "to dictate his own opponent".  "The government has set all the rules for the referendum to give itself every possible advantage. It has also demanded of the broadcasters that the prime minister should not have to debate representatives from the official Leave campaign," the spokesman added.  This row matters because it highlights once again the central dispute amongst those wanting the UK to leave the European Union: is Nigel Farage an asset or a liability to their cause?  Vote Leave think he will put off those who are yet to decide who to support - and so are livid that the UKIP leader will appear on the same ITV programme as the prime minister at the beginning of next month.  They wanted Boris Johnson or Michael Gove to appear instead.  But it's long been thought Downing Street would be reluctant for David Cameron to be seen to be so publicly at odds with cabinet colleagues.  In other comments a Vote Leave source on Wednesday accused ITV of having "lied to us in private while secretly stitching up a deal with Cameron".  The source said ITV had "effectively joined the official In campaign and there will be consequences for its future", saying "the people in No 10 won't be there for long".  And a Vote Leave spokesman said on Thursday: "We are discussing legal possibilities to increase the chances that the public will hear the issues properly discussed before they make such an important vote on the future of their democratic rights."  Responding to the criticism, ITV said in a statement that it had "not lied to anyone, nor has there been any kind of 'stitch up'".  A spokeswoman said Vote Leave had been invited to take part in a separate two-hour programme on 9 June and would have "every opportunity" to air its view.  The ITV statement added: "It was our editorial decision as to who would take part in the 7 June programme; the PM called the referendum, and the country wants to hear from him, and Nigel Farage has been a leading proponent of an exit from the EU for more than 20 years and his party received 3.8m votes at the election. We invited them both and they accepted.  "We think our viewers will find both programmes useful in providing information ahead of polling day. Our programming will, as always, be fair, balanced and duly impartial."  Meanwhile, Mr Farage accused Vote Leave "apparatchicks" of trying to block him from appearing on the TV debate and said they were "more interested in their careers" in the Conservative Party after the referendum.  "I have consistently tried to bring our side together. They have consistently tried to marginalise UKIP and divide us. They need to put their egos to one side," he told the BBC.  In an appeal for "unity", he said he would work with anybody, within reason, to secure a vote to leave on 23 June.  Mr Farage also accused the BBC of barring him from its planned TV debates, which include a live event at Wembley Arena on 21 June.  Number 10 says David Cameron will not debate against senior Conservatives who back EU exit, saying it does not want the TV debates turned into a "blue on blue fight".  "This is a major national debate and it should not be reduced to a narrow argument within the Conservative Party.  "We don't want it to become an issue of who's up and who's down in the Conservative party or seen just through the prism of the Conservative party," a source said.	politics

The advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) should reduce treatment to around nine months.  Currently, it can take as long as two years - and many patients fail to complete what can be a burdensome course.  Conventional treatment can involve thousands of pills and daily injections. Deafness is one of the main side-effects.  Cure rates are as low as 50% because patients abandon treatment, leading to further problems with resistance.  The WHO is also recommending a faster test for MDR-TB, which gives results within two days - compared with the current three months.  It hailed the guidelines as a "critical step forward". Around 5% of TB cases are thought to have resistance to the two most effective drugs.  This translates into 480,000 cases worldwide - and 190,000 deaths from this form of TB every year. Many patients are not being identified.  The shorter treatment plan costs less than $1,000 per patient - compared with conventional treatment which costs $2,400 for the medicines alone.  The International Union against TB and Lung Disease and Medecins Sans Frontieres have been involved in trials of the new treatment method in Bangladesh and nine African countries, which have influenced the WHO's decision.  The Union hailed today's advice as "an historic moment".  Its senior vice president, Dr I D Rusen, told me: "When we first saw evidence about the shorter regimen, back in 2007, it was almost too good to be true.  "Then further results which were consistent were presented at our conference late last year. Next year we'll have more evidence from a head-to-head trial comparing the two treatment methods.  "The shorter treatment plan uses different doses of existing drugs which were previously used for leprosy.  "So we hope there will be time for production to scale up, while countries get systems in place for the new guidelines, although it's possible there could be some supply issues."  David Lister, an MSF TB Doctor working in Uzbekistan, co-ordinated one of the studies and described the huge difference it made.  He said: "The prospect of two years of TB treatment drives parents to hide their children from treatment, teenagers to abandon their ambitions and adults to decide between providing for their family or getting healthy.  "The fear of relentless suffering due to side-effects manages to outweigh any hopes of cure and returning to a normal life.  "But when I say, 'it's only nine months' they say, 'I can do that'."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36274791	Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool	Thousands of patients in England may have been wrongly given or denied statins due to a computer glitch.  A third of GP surgeries are being told to contact patients who may have been incorrectly prescribed or not given cholesterol-lowering drugs.  The alert follows the discovery of a problem with a tool used to assess a patient's risk of heart disease and whether they need statins.  The medicines regulator said the risk to patients was low.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched an investigation.  "We are working closely with the company responsible for the software to establish the problem and address any issues identified," said a spokesperson.  "Clinical advice is that the risk to patients is low and only a limited number of patients are potentially affected.  "GPs have been informed and they will contact individual patients should any further action be necessary."  The computer tool is used to help GPs assess the potential risk of cardiovascular disease in patients.  GPs type in details including the patient's age, body mass index, whether they smoke and other health conditions, and the system calculates a percentage score stating their risk of having a heart attack in a decade.  About 2,500 surgeries in England are believed to be affected.  The IT company that makes the software, TPP, said it was working with the MHRA to ensure that clinicians were informed of any patients that may have been affected as soon as possible.  "TPP is dealing with the issue involving the QRISK2 Calculator in SystmOne," it said in a statement.  "The tool is intended to support GPs in assessing patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease and in developing treatment plans. "  The Royal College of GPs said the decision to prescribe statins to patients is never taken lightly and those who are prescribed them will undertake regular medication reviews.  "We would advise our patients who take statins, and those who have cardiovascular problems but don't, not to panic as a result of this news," said Dr Imran Rafi.  "But if they are concerned they should make a non-urgent appointment with their GP to discuss this."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36275608	NHS 'has busiest year in its history'	The NHS in England has had the busiest year in its history with more patients than ever seeking help, official figures show.  Nearly 23m people visited A&E in the 12 months to March 2016 - a rise of more than 500,000 from the previous year.  Delays rose throughout the period, with March itself having the single worst performance against the four-hour A&E target since it was introduced in 2004.  Targets for cancer, routine operations and ambulances have also been missed.  NHS England said the ongoing dispute with junior doctors had started having an impact, with the proportion of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for operations such as knee and hip replacements hitting its highest level.  A spokesman for NHS England also defended the figures, saying the proportion of people dealt with in four hours in A&E - 91.9% - was "almost certainly one of the best performances in the Western world" despite falling short of the 95% target.  The increase in demand means that while the target was missed, the actual numbers seen in four hours - just over 21m - was the highest-ever.  Other parts of the UK have also been struggling with the A&E target, with Scotland seeing the best performance in the past few months.  There are two ways to look at these figures. They're both the worst-ever and best-ever. While many of the key targets are being missed, it is also true that the NHS is seeing more patients than ever.  Think of it like a treadmill. The NHS is running faster than ever, but the speed is being increased and so it's struggling to keep up.  It is why many are praising staff for their hard work, while wondering what will happen next. We are now in a new financial year and the NHS is seeing its budget rise by nearly 4% above inflation.  Given how last year ended, concerns are being raised whether that is enough.  The data released by NHS England covers March, which means there are now complete figures available for the whole of the measured 2015-16 period.  Royal College of Surgeons president Clare Marx said the performance was "worrying".  And she added: "Dedicated frontline doctors and nurses are treating more patients than ever before.  "We welcome the extra money the government promised, but we still need a long-term plan to address the growing number of patients."  She also said the "underfunding" of social care, run by councils, also needed to be addressed as the lack of services in the community was increasing the pressure on hospitals.	health

Lord Ramsbotham said 30% of prisoners, some 25,000 inmates, could be freed.  And Bob Neill, Conservative chairman of the Justice Select Committee, said prisoner numbers in England and Wales needed to be cut straight away.  Justice Secretary Michael Gove has said he will not artificially "manage down" the prison population.  And the Conservative former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said reforms would not fully succeed until the prison population was reduced.  Plans for prisons are expected to feature in the Queen's Speech next week, setting out the government's planned legislation for the year ahead.  Asked whether prisoners needed to be released before any of Justice Secretary Michael Gove's reforms were put in place, Lord Ramsbotham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Absolutely. He can't possibly do it with the numbers as they are now."  The cross-bench peer said some prisoners on indeterminate sentences for public protection and those who are mentally ill should be let out, adding that he estimated 30% of inmates did not need to be in prison.  He said he supported the aims of the government's planned reforms, first spelt out by the prime minister earlier this year.  Ken Clarke, justice secretary between 2010 and 2012, said: "The reforms will not fully succeed until you reduce the prison population. You can do things if you have more sensible sentencing for people who aren't hardened criminals."  And Mr Neill said he strongly supported the government's reform proposals but added: "I think we should be looking to start reducing the prison population straight away."  But a fellow Conservative on the committee - Philip Davies - said a "ridiculously low" percentage of criminals were jailed. He asked: "Are we going to have rapists, murderers, burglars out of prison?"  Mr Gove has said he will not artificially "manage down" the prison population, believing his reforms will mean less reoffending and lower numbers over time. However, he has said "we should make changes within the current population".  In a speech on prison reform in February, the prime minister said the justice system should better address prisoners' illiteracy, addiction and mental health problems. He pledged to give prison governors more autonomy and to publish data showing how well or poorly prisons performed.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36266826	Record amount of fake Viagra seized	More unlicensed erectile dysfunction drugs were seized in the UK by the authorities last year than ever before - worth more than £11m. The Victoria Derbyshire programme joined a raid to find out why they are a problem.  The market for unlicensed Viagra is huge and most of it heads for the internet, where pills are sold for £2 to £3 each. These tend to be imitations or a generic Indian version of the drug - Kamagra - which are shipped to the UK in bulk, packaged up and posted on.  But what the computer-based consumers may not realise is the pills are made in unhygienic, unregulated locations and could contain toxic chemicals like lead and arsenic, the agency which regulates medicines says.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRSA) conducted its biggest-ever operation last week in an attempt to find the fakes, with search warrants at 24 properties conducted by 50 officers across London.  Speaking outside a suburban street where one of the raids was taking place, Danny Lee-Frost from the MHRSA says: "When you log on to a website and you see a picture of a scientist in a white coat and stethoscope, it all looks above board. But your medicines are not coming from a pharmacy, they are coming from a street like this.  "We've recovered medicines that are being sold from a shed in a back garden that was damp and rotten, there were rats and mice crawling all over the stuff."  Viagra is a prescription drug, meaning it needs to come from a doctor or pharmacist. But doctors believe there are many more people buying it on the internet and using it in a completely unregulated way.  Dr Hamed Khan GP said: "I've had a number of people who've had very serious side affects like visual problems, people could potentially faint, you could have dangerous reductions in blood pressure or even potentially heart problems."  So how do you spot a fake? At a counterfeit testing lab run by Pfizer - the drug company that makes Viagra - they examine products from around the world, and have found counterfeits in 111 countries.  They can tell by the colour of writing on the pack, while the actual tablets might be a different shade of blue. They then test them by taking a small amount and looking at its chemical footprint.  Pfizer vice-president Tommy Dolan says people may not know they are buying counterfeit products if they have nothing to compare them with.  "Sometimes the match can be close enough that the counterfeit is reasonably good, other times due to a lack of medication or too much medication in the product or agents that have been added that shouldn't be in the product that are toxic, the patient could come to significant harm," he says.  From 2014 to 2015 the MHRA seized fake Viagra valued at £3,890,516 from a yearly total of counterfeit drugs of £8,696,067. From 2015 to 2016 this had tripled to £11,205,342, making up 90% of counterfeit drugs seized that year.  While no pills were found at the property we saw being searched, the agency has £25m of fake medicine collected over the past few years in its lock-up.  Where is the demand coming from?  Mr Lee-Frost says there is a strong youth market for the drug. "It's used by adult males who don't actually have the medical condition which this could be prescribed for. They use it as a sexual enhancement for the weekend."  Dr Hamed Khan adds: "Increasingly younger people have been trying to obtain Viagra as they see it as a sort of recreational drug almost and it boosts them psychologically, which it absolutely doesn't, it's a drug that only has physical effects and that misconception is leading to younger people trying it even if they don't need it."  After dozens of searches and three arrests, the agency finds some bags of pills, but it is not as much as they had hoped. They believe the only way to win is to stop people buying it.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36272269	David Cameron sorry over 'IS' cleric comment	David Cameron has apologised for "any misunderstanding" after describing a former imam as a supporter of the Islamic State group.  He accused Suliman Gani in Parliament of backing the militant group as he questioned Sadiq Khan's judgement in sharing a platform with him.  Mr Gani has said claims he backs IS are defamatory and must be retracted.  At Prime Minister's Questions in April, Mr Cameron said Mr Khan had appeared on a platform nine times with Mr Gani, whom the prime minister alleged "supports IS".  Mr Gani said at the time that he wanted to take legal action against Mr Cameron but was unable to do so because of Parliamentary privilege rules, which protect MPs' freedom of speech in the Commons.  In a statement, Downing Street said Mr Cameron was referring to reports that Mr Gani supports "an" Islamic state.  A Number 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister is clear this does not mean Mr Gani supports the organisation Daesh and he apologises to him for any misunderstanding."  Several senior Conservatives attacked Mr Gani at the height of the London mayoral race and accused Mr Khan - who was elected London Mayor last week - of associating with extremists, an approach which Labour said was illustrative of a "divisive, dog-whistle campaign".  Mr Fallon apologised for an "inadvertent error" in labelling Mr Gani an IS sympathiser. He made the claim about the Tooting preacher during a BBC interview, as he defended the Conservatives' London mayoral election campaign.  In a message on social media last month, Mr Gani said he had "condemned IS wholeheartedly" since its inception and that it in no way represented his beliefs. He wrote: "Saying I support Islamic State is untrue and highly damaging to my reputation.  "I am totally opposed to so-called Islamic State which I view as a terrorist and inhumane organisation. Indeed as an imam and community leader, I have campaigned against the evils of Islamic State to my fellow Muslims and to others in the community."  Dr Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the "long overdue apology", but said "such smear-by-association has become all too common for Muslims and Muslim organisations".  "For the real extremists we are all opposed to, such tactics will only provide fresh new examples of a society not willing to accept Muslims for who they are," he said.  He called for the prime minister and the defence secretary to repeat their apologies in Parliament, and for an "urgent review" of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.	politics

The PM said the countries' leaders were "battling hard" to tackle the problem.  It comes after he was recorded talking to the Queen at Buckingham Palace.  An Afghan official said "bold" action had already been taken while Nigeria's president said he would not be demanding an apology from the PM.  Asked ahead of the anti-corruption conference in London if Nigeria was "fantastically corrupt", Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power last year on a promise to fight corruption, replied: "Yes."  Mr Buhari said he was more interested in the return of stolen assets held in British banks, adding that corruption in Nigeria was endemic and his government was committed to fighting it.  "What would I do with an apology? I need something tangible," Mr Buhari said, referring to efforts to recover the money.  The Afghan embassy in London said tackling corruption was one of President Ghani's top priorities and "bold" action had been taken.  "We have made important progress in fighting systematic capture in major national procurement contracts and are making progress on addressing institutional issues as well as issues related to impunity... therefore calling Afghanistan in that way is unfair."  Mr Cameron's original comment about the two countries came while he was speaking at an event to mark the Queen's 90th birthday about hosting world and business leaders at this week's anti-corruption summit in London  "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain... Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world," he was caught on camera saying.  Mr Cameron was asked about his comments during Prime Minister's Questions, where he jokingly checked his microphone was working, referred to "tips on diplomacy" and said he had made "many unforced errors" in the past 24 hours.  Answering a question from Tory backbencher Philip Davies - who asked why UK aid was being given to countries the PM sees as corrupt - he praised the action taken by Afghanistan and Nigeria and warned cutting off aid could "come back to haunt us here".  He also defended action by his own government, including on overseas tax havens and measures to make sure "plundered money from African countries can't be hidden in London".  In the footage showing Mr Cameron's comments, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intervened to say: "But this particular president is not corrupt... he's trying very hard," before Speaker John Bercow said: "They are coming at their own expense, one assumes?"  Earlier, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the PM had been "merely stating a fact" in his comments, and ex-London mayor Boris Johnson said people would "find it refreshing he was speaking his mind".  In Transparency International's 2015 corruption perception index, Afghanistan was ranked at 167, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea, Nigeria was at 136.  Transparency International said the success of Thursday's summit would be judged on whether concrete action was agreed on tackling tax evasion and secrecy in the wake of the Panama Papers disclosures, stopping tainted firms from bidding for public contracts and protecting whistleblowers who expose corruption.  US Secretary of State John Kerry - who is representing the US at the summit - said the fight against corruption should be made a global priority "of the first order".  "Today the cost of corruption globally is exploding, and it's exploding everywhere," he told the Oxford Union. "Despite recent progress, as a global community, we just are not doing nearly enough to eliminate this scourge - and that needs to change."  Labour has suggested a Tory government "hosting an anti-corruption summit was like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop".  "The government is refusing to take meaningful action to close Britain's constellation of tax havens, which together constitute the largest financial secrecy network in the world," said shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott.	politics

The trio of studies provide crucial experimental evidence that backs up fears the virus is behind the surge in babies born with small heads in Brazil.  They showed the virus could cross the placenta during pregnancy and kill cells to slow brain growth.  Experts said the findings add to the weight of evidence, but studies in animals with bigger brains were needed.  There have been around 1,300 confirmed cases of microcephaly - babies born with small brains - in Brazil, with thousands more under investigation.  The timing and location of Zika infections and microcephaly led to the World Health Organization declaring a global health emergency.  Microcephaly Why it is not the end of the world  What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread  Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do  The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect  Chinese scientists injected the Asian strain of Zika, which is closely related to the one circulating in south America, into the brains of mice foetuses 13 days after fertilisation.  The results, published in Cell Stem Cell, found the developing brain was smaller five days later.  Neural progenitor cells, which build the brain and nervous system, were particularly vulnerable to infection but the study showed "almost all cells in the brain" tested positive for Zika.  Dr Zhiheng Xu, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "The most surprising part of this study is that it was mostly neural progenitor cells that got infected in the beginning and mostly neurons that became infected at a later stage.  "However, almost all cell death was found in neurons."  Meanwhile scientists at Washington University have performed the first animal experiments showing how the infection spreads from a pregnant adult to the developing foetus.  It showed Zika preferentially targeted the placenta with viral levels 1,000 times higher than in the blood.  Their study, in Cell, found the virus damaged the placenta and was able to leak over to the foetus.  And a study, published in Nature, used the virus currently spreading in Brazil in animal tests. Again the research team showed mouse brain development was impaired.  Dr Alysson Muotri, one of the researchers in the third study from the University of California San Diego, said: "The media and some of the health agencies were ahead of themselves by concluding the Zika virus was causing microcephaly.  "Experimental and clinical proof that Brazilian circulating Zika virus causes microcephaly is only being presented now."  Dr Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University, said the findings "add to the weight of evidence that Zika virus is the cause of the apparent spike in microcephaly".  "However, the differences between mouse and human development mean that larger experimental animals that are more similar to humans - such as monkeys - must also be tested. "	health

A spokesman for the defence secretary said: "He naturally apologises for this inadvertent error."  Mr Fallon was among senior Tories to attack Mr Gani during London's mayoral campaign and accuse Labour's Sadiq Khan, who shared a platform with him, of associating with extremists.  Mr Gani has said claims he backs IS are defamatory and must be retracted.  After winning the London Mayoral election, Mr Khan, the first Muslim to hold the post, accused the Conservatives of running a "divisive, dog-whistle campaign".  Mr Fallon made the claim about Mr Gani during a BBC interview, as he defended the Conservatives' London mayoral election campaign.  In a tweet after the interview was broadcast, Mr Gani indicated he would be seeking legal action against the defence secretary.  When asked about the legal letter issued by Mr Gani's lawyers, a spokesman for Mr Fallon said: "Michael made clear he was quoting a claim by Andrew Neil on a BBC Mayoral debate programme.  "He was unaware of the clarification and apology that the BBC had issued on Neil's claim.  "Had he been aware, he would not of course have quoted him and as soon he became aware he put the record straight. He naturally apologises for this inadvertent error."

Meanwhile, the former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, helped the Vote Leave campaign launch its official battle bus this morning.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36263256	Gordon Brown says quitting EU would not be British	Gordon Brown has thrown his weight behind the campaign to stay in the EU, claiming it is "not British to retreat to Europe's sidelines".  The former prime minister argued that Britain needed to be in the EU to shape the continent's responses to terrorism, immigration and climate change.  And it was "not in tune with the Churchillian spirit" to "disengage".  Leave campaigners said Mr Brown's arguments "rang hollow" given his "disastrous record" while in office.  The British public will decide in a referendum on 23 June whether to remain in the EU or to leave.  With just over six weeks until the vote, campaigning has been stepped up by both sides. In other EU referendum developments on Wednesday:  In a wide-ranging speech at the London School of Economics, Mr Brown invoked Britain's history of standing up for human rights and fighting fascism and anti-Semitism.  He said the EU referendum should be an opportunity to make the positive case for Europe and the UK's "outward looking internationalism" and said Labour voters were more likely to respond to positive arguments for staying in.  The Remain campaign, he added, would have to secure the backing of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP voters if they were going to win - and the campaign should stress the benefits to ordinary people of EU membership over pay, working conditions and employment rights.  He echoed Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about the EU's role in preserving peace and stability.  "For 1,000 years nations and tribes of Europe were fighting to the finish and murdering and maiming each other. There is no century except this one where Europe has been at peace and nations... were not vying for supremacy," he said  But for the last 70 years since World War Two, nations now "battle with arguments and ideas" and not "with weapons and armaments".  "It is like we have not just exchanged swords for ploughshares, we have made it possible so that people never think that swords will be used again."  There are two silent concerns inside strands of the Labour Remain camp.  First that the focus on the economic message, Project Fear as it's nicknamed, isn't enough.  And second, Labour voters who might be a bit fed up with the EU but are reluctantly supportive might not turn out to vote.  During the Scottish independence referendum Mr Brown's last minute fiery political sermons were a shot in the arm for the Unionists.  He is intervening now (as ever) on his own terms, but the former prime minister's interventions this time might have some effect.  In the first of a series of planned speeches in the run-up to polling day, the former Labour leader said: "If this referendum is about anything it is about what kind of Britain we are and what kind of Britain we aspire to become.  "We should be a leader in Europe, not simply a member. We should not be fully out and we should not be half out. We should be fully in.  "We should recognise that the world has changed since the first referendum and we should be advocates for cooperation in an inter-dependent world."  In a question and answer session afterwards, Mr Brown said the EU was moving to a "more flexible" model, adding: "The future lies in a united Europe of states rather than a United States of Europe.  "Too much cooperation and people will feel their identity is at risk, too little cooperation and it will not be possible to solve the economic, social and environmental problems we face."  Ahead of his speech, Mr Brown used articles in the Mirror and the Guardian to argue that Britain must be at the heart of European policy making.  Mr Brown, who has been credited with stopping Britain joining the euro when he was chancellor in the 1990s, told the Mirror the British must stop being "reluctant Europeans" and shape the continent's responses to terrorism, immigration and climate change.  "I think most people would agree that it's not British or in tune with the Churchillian spirit to simply disengage when Ukraine is in turmoil. It is not British to retreat to Europe's sidelines when there is a common fight against illegal immigration and terrorism," he wrote.  "It is certainly not British... to allow ourselves to be on the periphery when important defence and security decisions are made, not only in Nato but in the European Union."  In a separate article for the Guardian, Mr Brown urges the EU to use its clout to take concerted action against tax havens.  In response, a Vote Leave spokesman said: "Gordon Brown was in a government that gave away part of our rebate and opened our borders across the EU. Lessons on the patriotic case for the EU will ring hollow from a prime minister with such a disastrous record in Europe."  Boris Johnson kick-started a UK-wide bus tour in Cornwall, a part of the country that has historically been eurosceptic.  Mr Johnson said of his Remain opponents: "They think they have got the big battalions because they have the taxpayers' money.  "We have got the passion, we have got the commitment.  "Let's make June 24 independence day for Britain," he cried, waving a pasty handed to him by a well-wisher.	politics

The independent arbitrator investigated 211 such complaints in a year.  Among them is the case of a 80-year-old woman, repeatedly sent home in a confused state to an empty house, only to be readmitted to hospital when neighbours raised the alarm.  The NHS says the findings will be taken seriously and improvement is under way.  The report shows that some of the most vulnerable patients, including frail and elderly people, are enduring harrowing ordeals when they leave hospital.  And that poor planning, co-ordination and communication between hospital staff and between health and social care services are failing patients, compromising their safety and dignity.  One patient, a woman in her late 90s, died in her granddaughter's arms shortly after being sent home from hospital in an ambulance, without a proper examination.  And a hospital transferred a distressed elderly woman to a nursing home in "a dishevelled state" with a tube (cannula) still in her arm.  One complaint to the ombudsman was from a family whose mother had been left in her home with no food, drink or bedding, unable to care for herself or get to the toilet.  Another was from a daughter whose frail mother, Pam, spent months in and out of hospital before her death.  Pam, born Alma Waller, was 80 when she died. In the months leading up to her death in 2012, she was sent home from hospital several times.  She lived alone and had Parkinson's disease and dementia. She was frail and unstable on her feet.  After initially being admitted to hospital following a fall, she was discharged and readmitted three times over a three-month period.  Her daughter, Angela Little, from Stevenage, says she still has nightmares about the poor care her mum received.  "She was an infirm old lady and the hospital still sent her home. The ambulance driver had to carry her in because she was so weak.  "I drove from my house, which is 40 minutes away, and I found this little old lady hunched in a chair shaking. She was absolutely terrified."  Angela says her mother had contemplated ending her own life because she was so distraught.  Pam was admitted to another hospital where she stayed until her death three weeks later.  Angela says: "I still can't believe what happened. Things need to change."  Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) Julie Mellor said: "Health and social care leaders must work harder to uncover why 10 years of guidance to prevent unsafe discharge is not being followed, causing misery and distress for patients, families and carers."  The body that produces guidelines - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - said its recommendations were clear and should be followed.  The Department of Health said the failings were unacceptable and it would ensure "lessons are learnt".  The PHSO investigated 221 complaints - an increase of over a third in the previous year. Over half of these were upheld or partly upheld.  A spokesman from NHS Improvement said patients should never be discharged from hospital without the appropriate safeguards in place.  But he said neither should patients remain stuck in hospital.  "Rather than frail elderly people staying in hospital longer than they need to, it is better to get patients home as quickly as possible and to assess them in their own homes rather than in a hospital - but this must be done with the right help and support in place."  Phil McCarvill from the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS providers and commissioners, said: "The experiences of the people in this report were unacceptable and we know that everyone in the NHS will take the findings seriously."  Ruth Isden, from charity Age UK, said: "It really is a mess and it's absolutely tragic for the older people and their families who're caught in the middle."  The charity Independent Age said: "The individual cases highlighted by this report are tragic in their own right, but they are also a sign of a health service under severe strain."  The Royal College of Nursing said it was hard for staff to consistently provide high quality, safe patient care without the right resources.  Are you a patient affected by this story?

The National Environment Research Council defended its decision to hold a public poll to suggest names, in which Boaty McBoatface got the most support.  Professor Duncan Wingham said the row had "put a smile" on people's faces.  But MPs asked if he would be made to "walk the plank" by ministers, who named it after Sir David Attenborough.  Prof Wingham was giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee about the episode, which attracted huge public interest and divided opinion after Boaty McBoatface was passed over.  He said that ministers' decision to name the vessel after the eminent zoologist and broadcaster - the option which came fourth in the poll - while allowing Boaty McBoatface to live on by naming a remotely operated sub-sea vehicle after it was an "eloquent compromise".  Asked by Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood what the episode had done for public engagement in science, the academic said it had attracted "extraordinary attention" which could only be regarded as an "incredible success".  "We could make the claim that we are probably the best-known research council in the world," he said.  "We could make the claim that because of that there are hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the UK but around the world, who know about us and the science that we have done  "In many ways we feel this has been an astonishingly great outcome for us. In addition, it has put a smile on everyone's face."  Prof Wingham said NERC would do the same again in the future, although he said there were no plans for other boats at the moment.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260573	MPs 'pay relatives £5,600 more than other staff', watchdog reveals	Family members employed by MPs are paid on average £5,600 more than other staff, a watchdog has revealed.  Pay of such "connected parties" has also risen at twice the rate of other staff, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) found.  The group called for a review of whether MPs should be allowed to employ relatives in the future, arguing jobs must not be "personal benefits".  In total, 139 MPs employ family members at a public annual cost of about £4.5m.  The review will only apply to future staffing as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said it would be "unfair and legally challengeable" to investigate existing contractual arrangements.  The watchdog, which is responsible for determining MPs' pay and expenses, said there was a lingering "perception of risk" about whether the taxpayer was getting value for money in terms of the number of family members and close business associates working for MPs.  After reviewing the matter in 2010, Ipsa decided against prohibiting the employment of family members, saying it did not believe the system was being abused and family members played a "valuable role" in assisting MPs - while limiting their numbers to one per MP.  The watchdog said it was still happy with the majority of contractual arrangements but believed that controls preventing the misuse of funds were "limited". Since relatives generally occupied more senior roles it found they were paid "significantly more" than other staff.  "Public concern about the employment of connected parties has remained," it said.  "In order to determine whether these constitute any grounds for concern, Ipsa would need to undertake intrusive and potentially disproportionate work to investigate the employment practices in MPs' offices.  "But, given that there remains a perception of risk to taxpayers' money, we are obliged to address it. Therefore we are consulting again on the practice, but only in respect of the employment by MPs of any new staff."  The issue will be considered as part of a wider review of business costs and expenses payable to MPs - with any change to the rules likely to take effect either next year or after the next election, scheduled for 2020.  Ipsa is also looking into the £4.4m cost of paying off staff who worked for the 182 MPs who retired at the last election or lost their seats.  While all the sums were within the rules, it expressed concern that £975,000 was paid to 125 staff who were taken on by newly elected MPs within the subsequent 10 weeks - "sometimes in the same constituency and in the same role".  As MPs are all separately self-employed, it said the election represented a "legal break" in the staffers' employment but it noted that in other areas of the public sector the rules had been changed to prevent staff from getting pay-offs if they are soon taken on in a similar field.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36259719	NHS short of front-line staff after bad planning, say MPs	Bad planning and cost-cutting have left the NHS in England short of vital front-line staff, MPs are warning.  The Public Accounts Committee said the shortfall in doctors, nurses and midwives could even get worse if ministers did not get a "better grip".  The group also warned there had been "no coherent attempt" to work out the staffing needed for a seven-day NHS.  But the government defended its record, pointing to the extra money being invested in the NHS this Parliament.  By 2020, the NHS budget is expected to have risen by just over £8bn once inflation has been taken into account.  The cross-party group of MPs acknowledged this in its report, but cast doubt on how far that would stretch given that ministers are trying to increase the availability of staff and services at weekends.  The report looks at clinical staff - those who provide care, including doctors, nurses, midwives and ambulance crews.  These account for more than 800,000 jobs - two-thirds of the entire NHS workforce.  It said working out the exact shortfall was difficult, but said estimates made two years ago suggested the NHS was short by about 50,000.  The report was published as it emerged that emergency surgery at a Nottinghamshire hospital has been suspended because of a shortage of junior doctors.  Surgical patients at Bassetlaw Hospital are now being transferred to Doncaster Royal Infirmary - almost 20 miles away.  Managers at the hospital said there was a lack of overnight staff and the problem was affecting 10 to 14 patients a week.  The MPs were scathing of the leadership provided by the government and national bodies, such as Health Education England, in recent years.  It said NHS trusts had been given conflicting messages - being urged to cut overheads to save money, while investing in staff in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal.  This has created a situation whereby the NHS had reduced the number of training posts available for core groups such as nursing, while struggling to retain staff, despite increases in demand for services.  The report said the high level of spending on agency staff seen in recent years was "largely the consequence" of this bad planning.  While NHS leaders have been quick to blame "rip-off" fees, prompting them to introduce a cap on how much can be charged, the report pointed out that most of the rise was a result of the NHS needing locum staff to fill gaps.  Committee chairman Labour's Meg Hillier said there were "serious flaws" in the approach of government.  "Front-line staff are the lifeblood of the service yet the supply of these staff in England is not keeping pace with demand.  "This poor workforce planning means patients face the possibility of longer waiting times and a greater cost to the public purse."  British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said this is a "disastrous" situation.  And Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies added: "What we have seen so far is how short-term decisions and budget cuts lead to nothing but lowered standards of care which could so easily have been avoided."  But a Department of Health spokesman said plans were in place to increase the number of staff in the NHS thanks to rises in spending.  "By 2020, we expect to have 11,420 more doctors working in the NHS, coupled with 10,000 nursing, midwife and allied health professional training places through our reforms. "	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260193	David Cameron calls Nigeria and Afghanistan 'fantastically corrupt'	David Cameron has described Nigeria and Afghanistan as "fantastically corrupt" in a conversation with the Queen.  The PM was talking about this week's anti-corruption summit in London.  "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain... Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world," he was overheard saying.  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, elected last year after vowing to fight corruption, said he was "shocked".  And a senior Afghan official said the characterisation was "unfair".  After Mr Cameron's comments, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intervened to say: "But this particular president is not corrupt... he's trying very hard," before Speaker John Bercow said: "They are coming at their own expense, one assumes?"  The conversation took place at Buckingham Palace at an event to mark the Queen's 90th birthday, attended by political leaders and other public figures.  At a garden party later on Tuesday, the Queen herself was caught on camera making unguarded comments about the Chinese government.  She told a senior police officer that she had heard the Chinese had been very rude to Britain's ambassador to China during President Xi's state visit last year. The Queen also agreed that the Chinese state visit had been a testing time for the police and told the officer it was "bad luck" that she had been in charge of security at the time.  On the face of it, it is perhaps one of the most undiplomatic things a prime minister could say - to describe two countries as fantastically corrupt just hours before their leaders visit Britain.  The prime minister's remarks were outspoken and unguarded but they were not untrue. Both Afghanistan and Nigeria come high on lists of the world's most corrupt nations.  And later in the conversation, the prime minister agreed with the Archbishop of Canterbury that President Buhari of Nigeria is not corrupt himself and is trying very hard to tackle the problem.  A Downing Street spokesman noted both men had written openly about the subject in a collection of essays being published this week.  So this was a truthful gaffe, another moment when the prime minister was caught on camera saying something ostensibly embarrassing.  Labour said Mr Cameron had egg on his face. But, as Downing Street acknowledged, the cameras were very close to the prime minister and his anti-corruption summit is now very firmly in the headlines.  In Transparency International's 2015 corruption perception index, Afghanistan was ranked at 167, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea, Nigeria was at 136.  With his remark, the archbishop was believed to have been referring to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who won elections last year promising to fight widespread corruption.  In response, Mr Buhari said his government was deeply "shocked and embarrassed" by the PM's comments. Speaking through his spokesman, he suggested that Mr Cameron must be referring to Nigeria's past notoriety for corruption before his coming to power last year.  The Afghan embassy in London said tackling corruption was one of President Ghani's top priorities and "bold" action had been taken.  "We have made important progress in fighting systematic capture in major national procurement contracts and are making progress on addressing institutional issues as well as issues related to impunity... Therefore calling Afghanistan in that way is unfair."  No 10 said the presidents of Nigeria and Afghanistan had "acknowledged the scale of the corruption challenge they face in their countries".  The government will host world and business leaders at the summit on Thursday in London, aiming to "galvanise a global response to tackle corruption". Speaking ahead of the summit, Mr Cameron said: "For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on.  "The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."  But Labour said a Tory government "hosting an anti-corruption summit is like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop".  "The government is refusing to take meaningful action to close Britain's constellation of tax havens, which together constitute the largest financial secrecy network in the world," said shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott.  Transparency International said the UK's record was mixed and concrete action was needed on tax evasion and secrecy in the wake of the Panama Papers disclosures, stopping tainted firms from bidding for public contracts and protecting whistleblowers who expose corruption.  Last year Mr Cameron was recorded talking about Yorkshire people "hating each other" - and he was previously caught revealing how the Queen "purred" with pleasure when he told her the Scottish independence referendum result.

The study found the "moderately" overweight now had lower rates of early death than those who were normal weight, underweight or obese.  The work, published in JAMA, looked at many thousands of people's height, weight and death rates at three different time periods since the 1970s.  A UK doctor said it did not mean being overweight was healthy or desirable.  And advice about preventing obesity should remain.  A person's body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.  In the mid-1970s, those with the lowest death rates were a normal weight and the obese faced a 30% higher risk of early death, the doctors, from Copenhagen University, found.  But now the threat to people's survival from being obese was now almost negligible  The authors say the most likely explanation is that health systems are now much better at treating obesity-linked conditions, such as high cholesterol and blood pressure.  Lead investigator Prof Borge Nordestgaard said: "Our results should not be interpreted as suggesting that now people can eat as much as they like, or that so-called normal-weight individuals should eat more to become overweight.  "That said, maybe overweight people need not be quite as worried about their weight as before."  The Danish researchers say their work shows a need to update the global categories that define excess weight, which are now two decades old.  But that idea was rejected by a British expert in metabolic medicine.  Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: "These data are of interest, but they do not change advice we have been giving on obesity and its treatment and prevention.  "The current findings do not mean that being overweight is protecting you from death, far from it.  "Obesity and overweight categories also signal risks for many diseases - such as type-2 diabetes, liver disease, cancers, sleeping problems, multiple pregnancy complications, to name but a few.  "Although we can manage many of those much better these days, such complications also impair quality of life and self-esteem, as well as increase health costs for societies."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260942	A history of prime ministers caught on mic	David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as "fantastically corrupt" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...  David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people "hate each other", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: "We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much." Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was "a total joke".  David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently "purred" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had "never heard someone so happy" at the result, and said she "purred down the line". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was "embarrassed" and "extremely sorry".  With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a "bigoted women". Mr Brown later said he was "mortified" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.  US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: "Yo, Blair. How are you doing?" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.  People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as "bastards" he would like to "crucify".	politics

"This isn't just about me. It's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world," he said.  Mr Khan also warned that Mr Trump's "ignorant" views of Islam "could make both our countries less safe".  Mr Trump said he was "happy" that Mr Khan would be leading London.  "If he does a good job and frankly if he does a great job, that would be a terrific thing," he added.  Mr Khan told the BBC he was supporting Hillary Clinton - who is vying for the Democrat nomination - in her bid for the White House, adding: "I hope she trounces him."  Last year, Mr Trump, the Republican presidential hopeful, called for a temporary halt to all Muslims entering the US in the wake of the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino, California.  He said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  What will Clinton v Trump look like?  Who will be Trump's running mate?  Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants and now London's first Muslim mayor, expressed concern during his election campaign that he would not be able to visit the US, if Mr Trump were elected, because of his faith.  Asked by the New York Times how the ban would apply to Mr Khan, Mr Trump said: "There will always be exceptions."  But in response, the new London mayor said: "This isn't just about me - it's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world."  He added: "Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays in to the hands of the extremists.  "Donald Trump and those around him think that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong."  Mr Khan officially took office on Saturday following Thursday's election, which saw him defeat his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614 - giving him a larger personal mandate than either of his predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone.  Mr Khan accused the Conservatives of using tactics "straight out of the Donald Trump playbook" in their campaign against him during the mayoral race, saying: "They used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other."  But senior Conservatives including Chancellor George Osborne and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon have defended the tone of the Tory campaign, saying it was part of the "rough and tumble" of an election.	politics

In 2008, nearly a third of five-year-olds in England - 177,423 in all - suffered tooth decay. By 2015, it had dropped to a quarter.  But health experts say more steps must be taken to help youngsters look after their teeth.  They recommend limiting sugary food and drink and regular trips to the dentist.  And children should brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.  Currently, an estimated 166,467 five-year-olds - less than a quarter - suffer from tooth decay.  But while there has been improvement nationally, experts say there is a great deal of regional variation.  The highest rates of tooth decay were found among children living in the North West of England, and the lowest in the South East.  Dr Sandra White, director of dental public health at Public Health England, said having healthy teeth was important for children, both for their health and their confidence.  "Our faces are quite a mirror to us, and we you smile with a nice smile it makes a big difference when we start school."  How to brush your teeth properly  She said the downward trend in tooth decay was welcome, and was probably down to parents and society being more aware of the impact of sugar on teeth.  "Parents have a key role in this. They need to watch what their children are eating and particularly drinking."  She said children were consuming three times the amount of sugar that they should be having, and a lot of that is coming from sugary drinks.  "It would be wonderful if everybody gave their children water and low fat milks." But she accepted that, realistically, it might be quite difficult for parents to achieve.	health

I have to admit I'm responsible for some of the 36 million views of HUGE CYST EXTRACTION (capitals not mine).  It's a gruesome experience reminiscent of a never-ending tube of toothpaste or watching an ice-cream seller slowly fill a cone.  And it's not alone, there's the allure of Woman's 20-Year-Old Cyst Finally Gets Popped or the disgustingly named The Pus Cannon.  Dermatologist Dr Pimple Popper, whose real name is Sandra Lee, gleefully tells her million-plus subscribers: "I know you guys love them."  On the BBC World Service's Health Check programme, we subjected one innocent volunteer, Matt, to his first cyst-burst viewing.  "Oh gosh, she's using scissors to cut it off, it's gross, argh," he squealed, but he stuck with it. "Aw, look at that, it's amazing what's in there."  So why do they have such an, albeit nauseating, appeal?  The answer is all down to "disgust", says Daniel Kelly, an associate professor in the department of philosophy at Purdue University and author of the book Yuck!.  Disgust is an emotional response that protects us from things that are poisonous or likely to spread infectious disease, whether it's rats or spoilt food.  Prof Kelly tells the BBC: "One of the really salient things that disgust keeps an eye out for are abnormal bodily fluids - so that is the key to these videos I think.  "What disgust does is when it detects one of these things, it keeps our attention trained on it, so it sort of generates this fascination."  And he argues such videos are a safe way to experience the "thrill" of disgust.  He says: "I think of it as analogous to the thrill people get riding a rollercoaster, or bungee jumping, where you get the 'voltage' of an emotional experience, without actually being at risk.  "Watching these kinds of videos, you get the thrill of an interesting emotional experience of feeling disgust, but you're not at risk of catching anything."  Dr Nisith Sheth, a consultant dermatologist for the British Skin Foundation, says: "I'm fascinated by the way people are really drawn in and people have become obsessed with them."  The growths - called epidermoid cysts - are sacs of dead skin cells and fats under the skin.  They are often found on the face, neck, chest, shoulders or near the genitals.  They are different to boils or abscesses, which are caused by an infection and filled with pus.  Dr Sheth, who treats people with them every day, says: "I'm used to seeing these things, they don't disgust me.  "One of the satisfying things is seeing it come out, and part of it is almost purging somebody of something which is foul or offensive.  "Often the people having it done on them don't want to watch, but I get frequent requests from partners and friends wanting to watch."	health

The official report into the UK's involvement in the 2003 Iraq War will be published on 6 July - nearly seven years after the inquiry was first announced.  The report - which is more than two million words long - was completed last month and the document has since been subject to a process of national security checks. It will now be sent to the printers.  It is looking at events between 2001 and 2009, centred on the UK's decision to take part in the 2003 invasion, which led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein - whether troops were properly prepared, how the conflict was conducted and what planning there was for its aftermath.  A total of 179 British service personnel were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians died over the period, though estimates vary considerably. Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot says he will not shirk from apportioning blame where he sees fit.  What is the Chilcot inquiry for?  The inquiry was announced by the former prime minister Gordon Brown in June 2009. The last public hearing took place in February 2011.  Although the inquiry never set a deadline for publication, it was widely assumed it would come out in either 2011 or 2012. The subsequent delays have angered the relatives of those killed as well as politicians on all sides of the debate.  There are a number of reasons why it has dragged out so long. The report is a massive undertaking, almost unprecedented in scope, covering almost a decade of public policy.  The inquiry has conceded that it underestimated the scale of the task and needed more resources to begin with. There have been unavoidable political delays, with hearings suspended in the run-up the 2010 general election. There have also been unforeseen events such as the death of one of the panel members, historian Sir Martin Gilbert.  But the main reason for the delay was the long tussle between the inquiry and the government over which classified material could be published alongside the report, or referred to in it.  An agreement was finally reached in the summer of 2014 over access to material such as minutes of Cabinet meetings and the "gists" of personal notes exchanged between former prime minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush.  The process of giving witnesses criticised in the report the right to respond - known as Maxwellisation - has also taken longer than expected.  The report was pored over by the security services after its completion.  Although this process was shrouded in secrecy, officials were reportedly looking for information that has been inadvertently included that could damage relations with the UK's allies, breach national security or violate the UK's international obligations in any way.  Sir John has said this is standard and necessary practice in official reports containing a lot of sensitive material.  However, he has now confirmed that no material has either been removed or redacted, which Prime Minister David Cameron has described as "good news".  Sir John is responsible for naming the publication date - although given the political sensitivities involved, it has to be agreed by Downing Street.  It is notable that Sir John waited until after the national and local elections on 5 May before making the announcement.  Logistically it will take several weeks for the report to be proofread, printed and for other arrangements to be made for its publication but the decision to wait until the start of July is significant.  Given the controversy surrounding Iraq more than a decade on from the invasion, it has always seemed unlikely that the report would be released during the final stages of the EU referendum campaign culminating in the 23 June poll.  David Cameron - who backed the war - and Jeremy Corbyn - who opposed it - will have other things on their mind at that point.  But the government would not have wanted to wait until the end of July when Parliament goes into recess and MPs would not have the opportunity to debate the report in full. So a date in early July always seemed most likely.  Most of those involved in the decision to go to war have since left front-line politics, although critics say their reputations are on the line.  Tony Blair, the British politician most closely associated with the war, appeared twice before the inquiry, defending his decisions and insisting he would do the same again. Gordon Brown, who was chancellor in 2003 and succeeded Mr Blair as prime minister, also gave evidence.  Other senior Labour ministers in the run-up to the war, including former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and International Development Secretary Clare Short also appeared.  The inquiry took evidence from a Foreign Office lawyer who quit in protest at the war and from Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general who advised ministers that the war was lawful. It has also heard from senior diplomats, civil servants and military commanders involved in the build-up to war and the military campaign.  Areas covered include the development of UK policy towards Iraq between 2001 and 2003 and UK-US relations over the period. There was scrutiny of the intelligence available on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and its influence on decisions taken by ministers, as well as events at the UN in the run-up to war.  There was also significant focus on the legal arguments surrounding the war and whether it was justified without explicit UN authorisation. Although witnesses were not asked to testify on oath, all those appearing were asked to sign a piece of paper saying they gave a "full and truthful" account of events.  No. There have already been four separate inquiries into aspects of the Iraq conflict. In 2003, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and the joint Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee both looked into the intelligence used to justify the war.  The Hutton inquiry, in January 2004, examined the circumstances surrounding the death of scientist and weapons adviser Dr David Kelly. The Butler inquiry, in July 2004, looked once again at the intelligence which was used to justify the war.	politics

Sir John said national security vetting of the report had been completed and it would be published without any material being redacted.  Relatives of the 179 British service personnel killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 would get "early sight" of the report, he added.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the publication date was "good news".  Why has Chilcot taken so long?  A spokesman for Tony Blair, who led the UK into military action and gave evidence twice to the inquiry, said the former PM "welcomed the fact that a date has been set for the publication of the report".  The public inquiry was launched in 2009 into the UK's participation in the US-led invasion of Iraq - which led to the toppling of Saddam Hussein and led to British troops remaining on Iraqi soil for six years.  The last public hearing took place in 2011. The report's publication was delayed initially by protracted negotiations over what previously classified material could be published and referred to, including correspondence between Mr Blair and US President George W Bush.  There was a further hold-up because the process of giving witnesses criticised in the report the right to reply took longer than anticipated.  Sir John said the final report would be more than two and half million words long and a date in early July would allow sufficient time for "final proofreading, formatting, printing and the steps required for electronic publication".  "National security checking of the inquiry's report has now been completed, without the need for any redactions to appear in the text," he said in a letter to Mr Cameron. "I am grateful for the speed with which it was accomplished."  In response, Mr Cameron - who has expressed frustration at the time taken to complete the report - said: "It is indeed good news that the national security checking process has been completed within two weeks and without the need for any redactions."  Jack Straw, who was Tony Blair's foreign secretary in the run-up to the war and gave evidence to the Chilcot inquiry, said he was "very pleased" that a date had been set for publication.  He told the BBC News Channel that the report was a "massive task" and he hoped it would be as "comprehensive" as possible.  "Well I'm glad that the report now is coming out - it's over seven years since it was first established and I look forward to seeing what conclusion Sir John and his colleagues come to," he said.  "It was a very important and controversial decision and it is right that the Inquiry has taken the time they felt they needed."  Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said it was "about time" the report was made public and while he respected Sir John's independence, he believed future inquiries must be conducted in a more timely way.  "They say justice delayed is justice denied, so any delay is unfortunate," he said. "The question is how do we do these things in future and we have to do them much better than this."  Rose Gentle, whose Royal Highland Fusilier son Gordon was killed in a bomb attack in Basra in 2004, said: "We are glad we have finally got the date. We just hope that everything we want to be in it is actually in it."  Sir John has said he will not shirk from apportioning blame where he feels that it is justified, both in terms of the decision to go to war and the preparations for its aftermath.	politics

The Labour leader is expected to highlight positives from last week's elections but say the results were "mixed" for the party.  He will also criticise MPs for "parading on the media to give a running commentary on our party".  "We need, if not across-the-board unity, then at least respect for each other," he will say.  In Thursday's elections, Labour held onto some key councils in England, remained the largest party in Wales and its candidate Sadiq Khan won the London mayoral election.  But it failed to make significant gains in England and slipped into third place behind the Conservatives in Scotland.  Addressing the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn is expected to point to the party's successes before adding: "But let's be clear. The results were mixed. We are not yet doing enough to win in 2020.  "This is only the first stage in our task of building a winning electoral majority, attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising those who have been turned off politics altogether - as we did last week in Bristol and London.  "But overall we have moved in the right direction. And now we have to build on these results."  Following his victory, Mr Khan said Labour could only win elections if it reaches beyond its own activists to a "big tent" of people.  Most MPs did not back Mr Corbyn in last year's Labour leadership contest, and some senior figures have expressed concern about the direction of the party and its prospects following the elections.  Mr Corbyn will say: "I don't expect, or even want, blind loyalty, but members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the Tories - and for our debates to be focused on policy, not personality."  The leader will also say the party is united in its opposition to the government's "failed economic policies", claiming there is a "broad consensus in support of a different kind of politics".  He will add: "Last week's elections showed Labour's recovery has begun in earnest. We now need to work together to turn that into the kind of sustained revival that will deliver an election victory for the whole country in 2020."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36230769	Junior doctors' contracts: Fresh talks under way	Fresh talks aimed at ending the dispute over a new contract for junior doctors in England are under way.  The two sides will attempt to resolve outstanding differences, which include Saturday pay and unsocial hours.  The government has put on hold, for five days, its plans to impose the contract.  The British Medical Association (BMA) has suspended its threat of further industrial action while the talks last.  This latest round of talks will be mediated once again by conciliation service Acas.  Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012, but talks broke down in 2014.  Under the terms of the new contract, basic pay is to be increased by 13.5% on average, but other elements of the pay package are to be curbed, including what constitutes unsociable hours.  Day hours on a Saturday will be paid at a normal rate, while extra premiums that are being offered for the rest of the weekend are lower than what is currently paid.  As a result of the dispute between the government and the BMA, there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine - but not urgent care - between January and early April.  Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS.  Meanwhile, researchers from Oxford University have said earlier findings backing the government's push for a seven-day NHS in England are based on flawed data.  One of the government's key arguments behind the push for a seven-day NHS in England - and a new contract for junior doctors - has been patient safety.  The new Oxford University paper concludes that hospital data suggesting a "weekend effect", where death rates are higher for those admitted over the weekend period, are deeply flawed.  It focuses on the Oxford Vascular Study covering more than 90,000 people in Oxfordshire, looking at hospital admissions for stroke between 2002 and 2014.  The researchers found more than a third recorded as being admitted for stroke were actually in for other things - often low-risk, routine procedures carried out on Monday to Friday.  They say these coding errors distorted the mortality figures, making them appear better for patients admitted on weekdays.  Without the mistakes, they argue, there was no "weekend effect".  They warn these errors are commonplace across the UK and not just for data on strokes.  The lead author, Professor Peter Rothwell, said it was time for an independent review to assess the "weekend effect".  "There's a wealth of poor-quality evidence based on hospital administrative data," he said.  "If you look at those studies that have actually done the due diligence and looked at real data - gold standard data - there's very little evidence indeed of a weekend effect.  "It really is an excellent example of how poor quality data, badly interpreted, can lead to the wrong answer."  He said government ministers had acted in good faith but had been "badly misled" by their advisers.  "Looking at where we are now, you could only describe it as a shambles," he said.  "We need to step back and work out to begin with is there a problem here that needs solving. The high-quality data suggests there's no problem to be solved."  BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said ministers should have been more careful.  "Yet again, this raises questions about the government's repeated use of misleading figures to undermine doctors and justify its pledge to increase seven-day services in the NHS," he said.  But Professor Nicholas Freemantle, from University College London, who co-authored an influential study in the British Medical Journal last year that highlighted a weekend effect, rejected the criticisms.  "He [Prof Rothwell] is raising issues we're very aware of and have done our best to take into account," he said.  "There have been enormous efforts to improve the data set in the period he's covered, so things have moved on.  "The statistical model we used was set up to use different aspects of the data sets. This model identifies patients likely to die with an extremely high degree of precision."  NHS England said: "This report about data collection covering one condition from nine GP practices in no way alters the wider issue that sick patients rightly should expect to be seen by a consultant within a few hours, have prompt access to tests and treatments and receive joined-up care, whatever day of the week they fall ill, as recommended by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges."  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there were numerous studies showing the weekend effect.  "I am not an academic but I think the mistake for a health secretary is to look at the overwhelming amount of evidence there is of a weekend effect and decide to get off the hook and disputing the methodologies."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36225590	'I was too embarrassed to talk about my periods'	Womb cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in the UK, with around 9,000 cases diagnosed each year, but it is rarely mentioned or talked about - even among women.  Daloni Carlisle, from Kent, is passionate about encouraging women to talk about their bodies so that they recognise the symptoms of a cancer which is affecting more and more women, particularly the over-50s.  She says it's all about using the right vocabulary and being open with friends.  "In 2013, before I was diagnosed, I would not have had a conversation about my periods. I just didn't talk about them.  "But we need to know what's normal and what's not normal with our bodies and that should start with conversations among women."  Daloni was diagnosed when she'd just turned 50 after experiencing prolonged bleeding.  "I'd never heard of womb cancer, it was simply not discussed. Most women have heard of ovarian and breast cancer but there was nobody talking about womb cancer."  She assumed it was the menopause starting and by the time she was referred to a gynaecologist, the cancer was already advanced. Massive surgery was required, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  It was a brutal, horrendous experience which took a year to recover from, she says.  Womb cancer is just one of five gynaecological cancers that start in the female reproductive system, but it is the most common - and rates are expected to rise by 56% by 2030.  There is a clear link between rising levels of obesity and womb cancer in the UK, driven by fat cells which trigger the growth of the lining of the womb. Being over 50 years old and having diabetes and hypertension are also known risk factors.  As a result, the Eve Appeal charity has set up a dedicated phone line to provide advice and information on women's cancers.  Tracie Miles, a gynaecological cancer nurse specialist, is delivering the new service, called Ask Eve, and she says making women more aware of the symptoms to look out for is her most important task.  But many years of working with women from diagnosis through treatment to follow-up has taught her that embarrassment prevents many women talking about changes to their patterns of bleeding.  And that often means they are good at ignoring signs of abnormal vaginal bleeding - after the menopause or between periods.  Most womb cancers occur in women who have gone through the menopause, around their 50s, so they will have seen their periods tail off, Tracie says.  "Women are used to having periods, then not having them, so a bit of bleeding or discharge and they tend to shrug their shoulders and say, 'It's probably nothing.'"  She tells the story of a woman who only went to see her GP after noticing specks of blood on her white knickers.  "Usually she wore black ones, and would never have noticed if she hadn't treated herself to some white ones after going through the menopause," she says.  Tracie's wish is that women become a little more aware because womb cancer is eminently treatable and curable.  "Just look when you pull your knickers down. It is something we do every day."  The standard treatment for womb cancer is surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy). If it is picked up early enough, there is no need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy.  Prof Martin Widschwendter, head of the department for women's cancer and consultant gynaecological oncology surgeon at UCL's Institute for Women's Health, says spotting those signs is easy compared with ovarian cancer, for example.  "Bleeding in post-menopausal women is very unusual and a very early sign of womb cancer so GPs will refer straight away. With a clear diagnosis at stage 1 there is a very good prognosis."  Daloni's tumour returned towards the end of 2015 and she has since had more internal radiotherapy treatment.  Fit and healthy with a full head of hair, she is enjoying life again - but she is also realistic.  "The reality is it's going to be back, but I can either live in a catastrophic future that hasn't happened yet or live for today."  In the meantime, she feels very strongly about encouraging younger and older women to talk about their gynaecological health so that they are aware of what's happening with their bodies.  "It's not easy to talk about - and it's good to know that there's someone out there who will help you talk about it."	health

Once applied, the formula dries to form a film that "mimics the properties of youthful skin", Nature Medicine reports after a series of small trials.  At the moment it is being explored as a commercial cosmetic product.  But the US scientists say their "second skin" might eventually be used to deliver medicines and sun protection.  The team from Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have tested their prototype product on a handful of volunteers, applying the formula to their under-eye bags, forearms and legs.  The polysiloxane polymer was made in the lab using molecules of silicone and oxygen as the building blocks.  Although it's synthetic, it's designed to mimic real skin and provide a breathable, protective layer.  According to the researchers, the temporary film locks in moisture and helps boost skin elasticity.  They performed several tests, including a recoil test where the skin was pinched and then released to see how long it takes to ping back into position.  As skin ages, it becomes less firm and less elastic and so performs less well in this sort of test.  Skin that had been coated with the polymer was more elastic than skin without the film. And, to the naked eye, it appeared smoother, firmer and less wrinkly.  The researchers, who have a spin-off company that could eventually market their patented formula, say the film is essentially invisible, can be worn all day without causing irritation and can withstand things like sweat and rain.  But more studies are needed before then. The polymer would also need safety approval from regulators.  Dr Tamara Griffiths of the British Association of Dermatologists says bags under the eyes are caused by the protrusion of fat pockets associated with ageing.  While entirely natural, some people see it as undesirable and seek ways to reverse it - sometimes resorting to surgery.  Dr Griffiths said: "The results [with the polymer film] appear to be comparable to surgery, without the associated risks. Further research is needed, but this is a novel and very promising approach to a common problem. I will follow its development with interest."  Prof Robert Langer, who led the work at MIT, said: "Developing a second skin that is invisible, comfortable and effective in holding in water and potentially other materials presents many different challenges.  "It has to have the right optical properties, otherwise it won't look good, and it has to have the right mechanical properties, otherwise it won't have the right strength and it won't perform correctly.  "We are extremely excited about the opportunities that are presented as a result of this work and look forward to further developing these materials to better treat patients who suffer from a variety of skin conditions."	health

Mr Cameron has said that he will not seek a third term but some have suggested he may have to quit sooner, if the UK votes to leave the EU.  While he is campaigning to stay in, many Tories are on the opposite side.  Mr Osborne, a likely future leadership contender, told ITV he did not envisage a contest until close to 2020 "when David Cameron says he wants to go".  Interviewed on ITV's Peston on Sunday, he denied being preoccupied by thoughts of becoming the next Tory leader.  "There will be a leadership election at the end of this decade, we've got a lot of work to do before then," he said.  "I fought very hard to get my friend elected as leader of the Conservative Party, then elected as the prime minister of this country and I'm very happy being part of that team that is bringing about this change to this country."  He added: "It will be the end of this decade in my view, when David Cameron says he wants to go."  Mr Cameron, who became prime minister at the head of a coalition government in 2010, will by then have served nearly two full terms in office.  He ruled out a third term before the 2015 general election, telling the BBC: "I've said I'll stand for a full second term, but I think after that it will be time for new leadership.  "Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many."  He named Mr Osborne, Home Secretary Theresa May and outgoing London mayor Boris Johnson as potential successors at the time.  But his position at the forefront of the campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union has meant some have questioned whether he can remain in the job if the 23 June referendum delivers a "Leave" result. The prime minister has said he will stay on, even if he ends up on the losing side.  But former chancellor Ken Clarke, a veteran pro-European Conservative, has suggested Mr Cameron "wouldn't last 30 seconds if he lost the referendum", predicting the party would be "plunged into a Conservative leadership crisis". And UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC last week he did not think Mr Cameron would remain PM if the UK votes to leave.  Others campaigning for the UK to leave, say Mr Cameron should stay regardless of the result. Commons leader Chris Grayling said in April: "It would be disastrous, in my view, for the Leave cause if we vote to leave and then we get distracted by a Conservative leadership contest. " Former Conservative leadership contender David Davis has said he believes Mr Cameron could stay on, but would not be able to lead exit negotiations.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36237052	Junior doctor contract: BMA to re-enter talks with government	The British Medical Association has said it will re-enter talks with the government over outstanding contract issues for junior doctors in England.  The union says these include Saturday pay and a fair contract that does not discriminate against women and others.  BMA junior doctors' committee chairman Johann Malawana said he hoped "real progress" could now be made.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday he wanted written agreement the talks would be held in good faith.  Ministers said they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.  Mr Hunt had previously accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.  The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.  It agreed to temporarily suspend planned industrial action in an attempt to reach a compromise.  Dr Malawana said: "The BMA has agreed to re-enter talks with the government on outstanding issues in this dispute, which include, but are not limited to, unsocial hours.  "Junior doctors' concerns extend far beyond pay, and our principle in talks will be to deliver a fair contract that does not discriminate against women or any other group, one which addresses the recruitment and retention crisis in the NHS and which provides the basis for delivering a world-class health service.  "The BMA will also call for any contract offer - agreed or not - to be put to a referendum of junior doctors, as is usual following a contract negotiation.  "We hope that with both parties back around the negotiating table, real progress can now be made to ending this dispute through talks."  Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.  A Department of Health spokesman said it "welcomed the BMA's decision to return to talks" and that it had always wanted to see a "negotiated solution".  "From Monday we will be looking for resolution on the small number of outstanding issues that separated both parties in February, principally Saturday pay, but also other issues that affect the motivation, recruitment and retention of junior doctors," he said.  Last month, for the first time in the history of the NHS, junior doctors when on all-out strike an stopped providing routine and emergency care.  The latest poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC suggested the majority of the public still backed junior doctors, although support was not as high after it became an all-out stoppage.  Asked whether they supported junior doctors striking while not providing emergency cover, 57% of those questioned said they did and 26% said they were opposed.	health

The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris.  Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014.  Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign.  The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as "striking" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.  A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a "victory over Islamophobia", and says London is breaking new ground. "The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think," it says.  Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: "Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor."  Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe.  With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that "Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims".  History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. "Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim," he says.  Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds.  "Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith.  In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says "two images of the United Kingdom" faced each other in this election: The "exemplary success story" of Mr Khan's life and "the billionaire's son", Mr Goldsmith.  "In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility," she told the paper. "It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side."  Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.	politics

Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.  Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.  The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says there should be no preconditions.  Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks.  The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days.  BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be "clarity about the next steps by the end of the day".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."  Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36219659	Elections 2016: Nigel Farage hails UKIP's 'breakthroughs'	UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed "breakthroughs" following a series of gains made by his party during the UK-wide local and assembly elections.  After 113 results out of 124 councils, UKIP has 55 seats so far, a gain of 26.  It won six seats on Thurrock Council and just missed out on being the largest party by a single vote.  Ex-Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless were among seven gains on the Welsh Assembly, and UKIP came second in two Westminster by-elections.  It was beaten by Labour in Ogmore, in South Wales, and Sheffield Brightside in South Yorkshire.  But it gained two seats on the London Assembly, for David Kurten and mayoral candidate Peter Whittle, from the London-wide top-up list, where it came fourth with 171,069 votes, its best performance in London for some years.  Mr Farage told Sky his party was "really biting hard" into Labour's vote and was "the third biggest party now in the United Kingdom by a country mile".  He added: "There will be many people who see Jeremy Corbyn's Labour as more extreme than UKIP by a country mile."  Mr Hamilton, who was a Conservative MP for Tatton from 1983 until being voted out in 1997 after becoming embroiled in the cash for questions controversy, admitted Mr Farage had opposed him standing for UKIP.  "Well, there's no secret about that, but Nigel is a democrat and I was selected by the overwhelming vote of the party members in Wales for a winnable place on the Assembly list," he told BBC Radio 4's World At One.  "We will all work together as a team regardless of things that have divided us hitherto."  "I think it has been recognised that UKIP are challenging us," she said. "I think that is a deep worry."  Mr Farage also tweeted that UKIP's progress in Wales justified the amount of money he had spent travelling there to campaign in the Welsh Assembly elections.  Polling expert Professor John Curtice said UKIP's vote in Wales was simply maintaining the level that the party achieved in 2015.  Among its other gains around the country, the Eurosceptic party gained two seats in Bolton, where its total reached five.  In Havant, the party gained seats from Labour in wards that the party has not previously contested at all.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36228094	Jeremy Corbyn: Labour's 'hung on' and defied pessimists	Jeremy Corbyn said his party had "hung on" and defied predictions of local election losses in England.  The Labour leader hailed an "excellent" result in Wales and pledged to "walk hand in hand" with Scottish colleagues after they slipped to third behind the Conservatives.  Labour retained control of several key councils in England and remained the largest party in Wales.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told "begrudgers" to "put up or shut up".  Pollsters had predicted losses for Labour in the local elections, with the party defending gains it made in 2012 under Ed Miliband.  Speaking alongside Gill Furniss, who won Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough in one of two Labour Parliamentary by-election holds, Mr Corbyn said: "All across England last night we were getting predictions that we were going to lose councils. We didn't.  "We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places."  He congratulated the "hard work" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: "There is a lot of building to do in Scotland.  "We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again."  They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.  Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.  In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.  In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.  A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a "weak leader" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as "shocking".  The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.  "We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats," Tim Roache, its general secretary said.  "Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows."  But Mr McDonnell told critics to "get behind the leader of the Labour Party that was democratically elected".  He added: "I think most Labour Party members are saying 'look, you're damaging our campaign by the continuous carping'.  "I've never been in a situation where, two days before a poll, a group of them are talking to the media about a leadership coup - and yet we still do well."  Former Labour minister Lord Falconer urged the party to focus "outwards" following a row over anti-Semitism involving the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.  "There's real issues that need to be dealt with, but this idea of a divided party makes the Labour party despair and the public despair," he added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36229789	Norman Lamb: Gains signal Lib Dem 'fight back'	Former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Norman Lamb claims the party is "fighting back" following "modest gains" in England's local elections.  The Lib Dems, who were almost wiped out in the 2015 general election, have 289 councillors so far - an increase of 29.  The party has won five seats in the Scottish Parliament election, but just one in the Welsh Assembly.  "It's very many years since I was last able to say 'Lib Dem gains' but that's what we're seeing today," said Mr Lamb.  "It's modest, there's nothing dramatic happening, but we're up four points on last year. We have gained two constituencies from the SNP in Scotland - that would have been hard to imagine a few months ago.  "Kirsty Williams in Wales won a seat that we lost to the Conservatives in the general election last year - and across England, modest gains - so green shoots after a near fatal knock out blow last year and it shows that there's still life there and we're fighting back."  Meanwhile, John Leech, former Lib Dem MP for Manchester Withington, has resumed his seat on Manchester City Council.  The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015, were hammered in last year's general election, when their ranks of MPs were reduced from 57 to eight.  Mr Lamb, a former health minister, told the BBC his party now has to be very clear about what it stands for "so people understand the point in voting for the Liberal Democrats", adding there is "a desperate need for a liberal progressive movement" to challenge the Conservatives as Labour has "taken itself off to the left".  "If you just get a sense that the Tories have no challenge, then you get arrogant and complacent government and that's why it's just so important that we rebuild and rebuild as fast as we can," he said.  Fellow Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said while the party is not "cracking open any bottles of bubbly" in the wake of the results, "any gains" are good news, and the task now is to rebuild its identity "which got lost" during its time in the coalition.  "The party as a whole will feel we fought a good battle yesterday and it's paid off. We're positive about our future now," he said.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36218893	Andy Burnham considers Greater Manchester mayor bid	Labour's Andy Burnham says he is considering standing to be mayor of Greater Manchester when the position is created in 2017.  The shadow home secretary said he had been approached over the role and would "take soundings" in the coming days to make up his mind.  The Leigh MP and former health secretary plans to remain in the shadow cabinet even if he does run.  He has been defeated in two Labour leadership contests.  George Osborne's "Northern Powerhouse" agenda saw the creation of the new post of Greater Manchester mayor as part of the devolution of extra powers to the region.  Former Labour MP Tony Lloyd is serving as the interim mayor of the combined authority, until next year's first election for the role.  "I had not planned for this to come out at this time," Mr Burnham said, saying it was "very early days".  "I have had people approaching me to consider it, so I have decided to consider it."  He said the creation of a regional mayor was an "important change in British politics", saying the North should have a voice alongside Scotland and Wales.  "I still feel we get treated as second class citizens at times, we do not get the investment that London and the South gets," he said.  Whoever does run for the job should be "big enough to get that voice heard", he added.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News it would be "a real loss to Parliament" if Mr Burnham did run.  Mr McDonnell said he understood why Mr Burnham was approached to run and why he would be tempted, but that he would like him to stay in the shadow cabinet.  "I can see why people in the North are approaching him because he is such a good advocate for the North and he has been a tremendous MP in Parliament," he said.  "If he goes, it would be a real loss to Parliament and a loss to the Labour Party as we go into government in 2020, but I can see why people are approaching him."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36213697	Skin bacteria stay 'stable over time'	Everyone has their own personal range of bacteria living on their skin that stays largely unchanged over time, a US study suggests.  It found sites of oily skin, such as backs and ears, had the most stable microbial fingerprints.  But even exposed dry sites such as palms were relatively stable.  Feet were among the areas that changed most in their microbial make-up, perhaps due to factors such as personal hygiene.  Human skin is home to a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.  Most are harmless or even beneficial, but some have been linked with skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis and eczema.  Research into how skin bugs vary across the body helps explain why eczema tends to affect moist sites such as the bends of the arms, while psoriasis commonly occurs on dry exposed areas such as the elbows.  But it has been unclear how communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi found across the skin vary over time and how these changes might affect health.  In a study published in the journal, Cell, researchers took skin samples from 12 healthy people at three times over a period of one month to two years, encompassing 17 areas of the body.  Heidi Kong, of the National Cancer Institute, and Julie Segre, of the National Human Genome Research Institute, found healthy individuals kept their own unique microbial signatures despite exposure to clothes, washing, other people and the outside world.  However, the stability of skin bugs varied among individuals and microbial strains, with some showing more changes than others.  In the future, the scientists plan to study patients with eczema and other conditions to look at how microbes might vary with disease.  "Future studies can use the knowledge of the relative stability of the skin microbial communities in healthy adults to understand how various exposures or disease state may alter these skin microbes," said Dr Segre.  "For example, studies in acne patients could explore whether specific strains bloom during adolescent acne flares or change with medications such as antibiotics."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36211045	Ministers and junior doctors agree to new contract talks	The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has welcomed the agreement from the government and the British Medical Association to return to talks over the new junior doctors' contract in England.  The Academy had appealed for both sides to end the dispute after strikes and thousands of cancelled operations.  Junior doctors have been striking over plans to impose new working conditions.  Talks over the controversial new contract broke down in February.  The government has said it is willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days from Monday to allow for talks.  But it said the doctors' union must focus discussions on outstanding contractual issues such as unsocial hours and Saturday pay.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt indicated the government was willing to compromise.  "We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday.  "That's the situation we have at the moment - about three times less medical cover at weekends."  He added: "I hope very much that the BMA will take up the offer to talk constructively."  The Prime Minister also welcomed the possibility of talks between ministers and the British Medical Association, saying it was important that the talks focussed on the "10%" of issues in the contract that had not been agreed, "particularly Saturday working".  The British Medical Association has agreed to stall any new threats of strikes - also for five days.  Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA junior doctor chairman, said: "Junior doctors have said since the outset that we want to reach a negotiated agreement, and have repeatedly urged the government to re-enter talks.  "We are keen to restart talks with an open mind.  "It is critical to find a way forward on all the outstanding issues - which are more than just pay - and hope that a new offer is made that can break the impasse."  Bob Webster, from the NHS Confederation that represents NHS trusts in England, welcomed the move.  He told the BBC: "It's critical that we've now got an agreement it seems that people get back into the room and talk.  "It gives me some hope that we can get a way out of this dispute which will be good for the NHS and good for patients."  Professor Dame Sue Bailey, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, called on both sides to end the stand-off after months of wrangling which have led to strike action.  She told the BBC said she was optimistic about the outcome of more talks.  "I think if they're in a safe space with a good senior person there from outside health, they can look at the remaining areas, the 5 to 10% cent that needs to be agreed.  "And really this has to be the way forward because, if we don't, I think in the future we will look back with regret."  If a week is a long time in politics, 24 hours is a long time in the junior doctors dispute.  That's the time it took for a new proposal to get the government and the BMA back to the negotiating table to emerge and then be fully analysed and accepted in principle by both sides.  At one stage in that timetable it looked as if the proposal for a five day "pause" would hit the buffers as the Government indicated it was not possible to change the process of imposing a new contract.  Then came a change of tack by ministers as they decided they could after all put imposition on hold for five days and start talking again about doctors' pay.  There is no certainty the talks will get off the ground. The BMA wants a wider agenda and details of the process have not been thrashed out.  But after three months with no talks and several strikes there is now some prospect of a way out of this dispute.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.  While the BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continuing discussions.  Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.  Last week there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS.  Only this morning a Department of Health spokesperson was said "it is now too late to change the process of bringing in contracts".  But speaking in the House of Lords, the health minister Lord Prior of Brampton said Mr Hunt was willing to "pause" the introduction of the new contract.  However he insisted that weekend pay must be on the agenda.  Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander welcomed the offer of a pause and said the two sides had to resume discussions.  "It is imperative that Jeremy Hunt puts his pride to one side and resumes negotiations with the BMA."	health

Elections are taking place for the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and for 124 councils in England.  Mayors will be elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford, with UK parliamentary by-elections held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside.  Police and crime commissioners are also being elected in England and Wales.  Problems were reported in Barnet, North London, where the council apologised after some people were unable to vote on Thursday morning.  The Electoral Commission said some polling stations did not have the correct lists of people's names.  Later in the morning, the council said the correct registers had been delivered and those denied a vote should come back.  Polling stations across the length and breadth of the country opened at 07:00 BST, with voting allowed until 22:00 BST.  Thursday's polls are the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020.  Elections to the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh and the devolved assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast last took place in 2011.  The SNP has been in power in Scotland since 2007, while Labour has run the Welsh government since 1999.  There is a power-sharing arrangement in place in the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been the two largest parties at Stormont since 2011.  In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - are up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.  In London, the Greater London Assembly will be elected, as will a successor to the capital's mayor Boris Johnson, who has run City Hall since 2008. Mayoral contests will also be held in Bristol, Liverpool and Salford.  New MPs for the constituencies of Ogmore, in Bridgend County, and Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough will also be chosen.  The Ogmore by-election was triggered by former Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies's decision to stand for the Welsh Assembly. The Sheffield contest was caused by the death of sitting Labour MP Harry Harpham.  Voters in 40 police force areas in England and Wales, excluding London and Greater Manchester, will also elect a police and crime commissioner. The inaugural elections for the positions were held in 2012.  Counting will take place throughout Friday with the majority of results declared on the day.  However, some English council results will not be announced until Saturday while the final result of the Northern Irish election is not expected until Sunday.  What to expect when (all timings are estimates)  00:30 First results from councils in England - around 80 results expected overnight  01:30 First results from Scottish Parliament - results in all 129 seats expected overnight  02:15 First results from Welsh Assembly - results in all 60 seats expected overnight  Results of Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner election and Liverpool Mayoral contest also expected overnight  11:30 First results from around 50 councils in England to declare on Friday  17:00 First preference vote share information for elections to Northern Ireland Assembly  1800 Result of first preference votes for Mayor of London (final result expected early evening)  Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Salford Mayoral contest also expected on Friday  14:00 Results from five remaining councils in England  16:00 Result of elections to Bristol Council (final council in England to declare)  Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in Wales and final result of elections to Northern Ireland Assembly also expected on Sunday	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35813119	Guide to May 2016 elections in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland	Britain goes to the polls in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place on 23 June.  Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:  Polls close at 22:00. After that, counting begins, with the results coming in at different points over the next 24 hours.  Watch: Which seats are up for grabs?  In London, counting the votes will begin the day after polling day, with the new mayor expected to be announced from mid afternoon. Votes cast for the London Assembly will also be counted on Friday.  Declarations in Scotland and Wales are expected overnight on Thursday, and during Friday in Northern Ireland.  Where to watch the results on the BBC  An election special, presented by Huw Edwards, starts at 23:45 on BBC One, after Question Time, with coverage throughout the night as results come in. On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.  All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.  Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.  There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests. In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.  If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.  Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote. A member of staff will give you a ballot paper with a list of candidates and parties on it. Put a cross in the box next to the ones you want to vote for.  The deadline to apply to vote by post has now passed. If you have already applied, ballot papers should be completed and returned, ensuring you leave enough time for them to arrive by 10:00 on 5 May.  If you have a specific, long-term reason that you can't vote in person, such as a disability or being overseas, you can apply to allow someone to vote for you. Full details about proxy votes, as they are known, are on the Electoral Commission website.  If you are suddenly incapacitated or taken ill, you can apply to vote by proxy for medical reasons up until 17:00 on polling day. Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.  What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up.  What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.  What happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.  What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game.  What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.  What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.  What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.  What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives. The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance.  The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.  State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 "omnishambles" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.  Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England.  All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and Rotherham  Metropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland. All but five are Labour held.  Unitary authorities: In three councils - Bristol, Peterborough, Warrington - all seats are up for election while 16 others have a third of seats up, including Derby, Hull, Milton Keynes, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton and Swindon.  District councils: 12 district councils have all their seats up for election (mostly Conservative controlled towns like Colchester, Gloucester and Woking) while seven have half of their seats up for grabs. In a further 51 councils a third of their seats being contested (a mix of mostly Labour and Tory controlled towns scattered across England).  Mayors are all elected in the same way, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.  The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.  The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).  The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.  The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).  State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.  The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May.  What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.  The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.  The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.

In total, two kidneys and two livers were donated after death to seriously ill people who also had the virus.  NHS transplant experts said the breakthrough would help reduce the shortage of donor organs and they hoped more people with HIV would join the organ donor register.  About three people a day die waiting for an organ transplant.  Prof John Forsythe, associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: "It's exciting that some people with HIV in the UK have helped benefit patients with HIV after their death by donating their organs.  "While organ transplants from donors with HIV are limited to recipients with HIV infection, innovations like this open up the possibility of donation where it did not previously exist and will help to reduce the shortage of donor organs."  At present, organs from donors with HIV can only be donated to people who also have the HIV infection.  All potential donors are tested for a number of infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  The first successful kidney transplants took place at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London in 2015.  Two functioning kidneys were donated by a donor with HIV who had died and were transplanted into two patients with HIV who had kidney disease.  Dr Rachel Hilton, consultant nephrologist at the hospital, said: "These successful kidney transplants represent an important breakthrough.  "Previously organs from deceased patients with HIV were lost because it was not known whether it would be safe or effective to use those organs.  "We now know that we can accept organs from deceased patients with well-controlled HIV, to give to other HIV-infected patients on the transplant waiting list."  She said those patients with kidney failure were in desperate need of a donated organ, which could make a huge difference to their life expectancy.  But there are risks that a donor with more advanced HIV could pass on some of the more serious complications of the condition to a recipient and pose a threat to their health.  Prof Forsythe said it was important that organs were donated safely and did not cause harm to the recipient.  "We carefully evaluate all donors. And with potential donors with HIV, we also need to understand how well their HIV has been treated and whether the donor had any infections or illnesses associated with more advanced HIV," he said.  "Surgeons will use this information to balance the risks of using an organ from someone with HIV with the risk of their patient dying while waiting for another organ to become available."  Ian Green, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, said the organ transplants were "pioneering".  "Some illnesses are seen more frequently in people living with HIV than in the general population, including liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses B or C, and these can result in the need for a transplant," he said.  "People with HIV in need of an organ transplant can benefit enormously from a donated organ."  He said that for some time patients with HIV had benefitted from donated organs from donors without HIV.  He added: "If people living with HIV can receive organs from donors who also had HIV, there is potential benefit for everyone."	health

Air pollution contributes to 40,000 early deaths each year in the UK and we gulp in more of it when we exercise.  On the other hand, regular exercise reduces the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers.  The University of Cambridge study showed that even in cities with high pollution levels, the benefits outweigh the risks.  The researchers used computer simulations to compare data on different kinds of physical activity and different levels of air pollution in locations around the world.  It found that for an average air pollution concentration in an urban area, the tipping point - when the risks begin to outweigh the benefits - comes after a huge seven hours of cycling or 16 hours of walking a day.  It is far beyond what most people would ever do.  "Even in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world - with pollution levels 10 times those in London - people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits," said Dr Marko Tainio, the lead author of the study.  He added: "We should remember, though, that a small minority of workers in the most polluted cities, such as bike messengers, may be exposed to levels of air pollution high enough to cancel out the health benefits of physical activity."  The study, published in Preventive Medicine, said exercise was always beneficial in London.  The average air pollution level for cities around the globe is 22 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In London the air pollution level was recorded at 16 micrograms per cubic metre in 2011.  Senior author Dr James Woodcock added: "Whilst this research demonstrates the benefits of physical activity in spite of air quality, it is not an argument for inaction in combating pollution.  "It provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bikes - which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity."  The research was carried out by experts from the University of Cambridge's Centre for Diet and Activity Research and Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, along with researchers from the University of East Anglia.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36197153	How the BBC reports polling day 2016	Strict rules mean the BBC, like other broadcasters, isn't allowed to report details of campaigning while the polls are open.  In all national elections, the BBC is required by electoral law to adopt a code of practice, ensuring fairness between candidates.  The basic principle behind due impartiality in political coverage is set out in the agreement accompanying the BBC Charter.  This requires the BBC over time to "give due weight and prominence to all the main strands of argument and to all the main parties".  So, on polling day specifically, the BBC (like other broadcasters, though they are covered by the Ofcom Code rather than a charter) doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00:30 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk.  However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer.  Coverage on the day is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather.  Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself, so the BBC's output cannot be seen to be influencing the ballot while the polls are open.  No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed.  Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election.	politics

Jeremy Corbyn urged voters to "send a message" to David Cameron but appeared to back away from earlier claims that Labour would not lose seats in England, saying predictions "are not that important".  The PM said a vote for his party would secure services and keep bills down.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was taking nothing for granted in Scotland.  Guide to May 2016 elections in UK  The Scottish First Minister made her party's case for another five years in power at a final election rally in Glasgow. Northern Ireland's five main party leaders have debated for the last time on the BBC.  The polls will be the largest, in terms of the number of votes expected to be cast, before the next general election. All nations and regions of the UK are going to the polls on what has been dubbed "Super Thursday".  As well as elections to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly of Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly, there will be votes for new mayors for London, Liverpool, Salford and Bristol, as well as for members of the Greater London Assembly.  More than 2,700 seats will also be up for grabs in 124 English council elections, while parliamentary by-elections will be held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside, both won by Labour at the last general election.  All police and crime commissioners in England will be up for re-election.  Ahead of his first UK-wide electoral test and amid renewed speculation about his leadership, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to demonstrate his party is making progress after last year's calamitous election defeat.  Mr Corbyn insisted on Tuesday that his party would not lose seats in England and would improve on its performance in 2012 - when the majority of the seats were last fought - when Labour gained almost 800 seats under Ed Miliband.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn's aides were now suggesting his comments had been "misinterpreted" amid the very real prospect of Labour ending the night between 100 and 300 seats worse off.  Speaking during a visit to Wales, Mr Corbyn said: "What I said was, I was not predicting any losses". With the polls now less than 24 hours away, he said "predictions are not that important".  Mr Corbyn campaigned alongside Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who is seeking to hold off a resurgent Conservative Party and win enough seats to enable Labour to maintain its 17-year grip on power there.  "The Tories' failed economic policies mean there is now a multi-billion black hole to fill in this Parliament," Mr Corbyn said. "The Tories can no longer be trusted with our communities so send them a message on 5 May."  As the Welsh campaign enters its final stages, Plaid Cymru said it could call a referendum on further assembly powers if it wins power. UKIP has said it expects to win at least five seats in Wales in what it says will be a major breakthrough.  In England, the Lib Dems and the Greens are hoping to make gains while in London, all eyes are on the contest to succeed Boris Johnson as mayor, with the Conservative Zac Goldsmith trying to extend his party's eight-year rule at City Hall.  On Tuesday evening, David Cameron joined Mr Goldsmith at his final rally of the campaign, saying he was the "right man" for the capital as a whole and Londoners should not be "lab rats" for Labour's experimental economic policies.  Labour candidate Sadiq Khan urged Londoners to choose "hope over fear" and played down suggestions he would be affected by the party's recent troubles, saying: "You won't see Jeremy Corbyn's name or Ken Livingstone's name" on the ballot paper."  BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt says Mr Khan plans to keep Mr Corbyn away from his victory celebrations should he prevail, and the two men would not be seen together for several days.  But Mr Khan's team said Mr Corbyn had been invited to his post-election gathering.  Find out more about who is standing in the London elections.	politics

Unlike existing machines, the Star robot is self-controlled - it doesn't need to be guided by a surgeon's hands.  In tests on pigs, it at least matched trained doctors at mending cut bowel, Science Translational Medicine reports.  But it is very early days and it remains to be seen if people would trust such a "hands-off" approach.  Robots performing surgery are not new. Hospitals in the UK and the US already use robot assistants to help cut out hard-to-reach tumours, such as prostate cancer.  These devices, such as the da Vinci System, are an extension of the surgeon - gadgets that give the operator better sight of the target and more adept tools to get the job done.  But scientists are now trying create a new generation of robots that will work independently, albeit under close supervision, to remove human error.  In theory, the medical team could sit back and watch the machine perform, and only get involved if necessary.  Robots are best suited for repetitive, predictable work. Getting them to stitch soft tissue that slips and slides around in the body when it is manipulated is a challenge.  Dr Peter Kim and colleagues at the Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, say they have found a way to get round this with their Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot or Star.  Star "reads" fluorescent markers in the soft tissue to know precisely where to plant its stitches on the moving target.  Like a regular sewing machine, it can be programmed for things like stitch size, pattern and tension.  And it appears to perform slightly better than skilled humans in terms of stitch positioning to repair a cut in a pig's intestine.  Dr Kim said: "If you want to throw in 20 stitches, it is not enough that a human being does 19 out of 20 well. You have to do all 20 of them well to have a good outcome.  "This machine will consistently throw in 20 perfect sutures."  That is not to say the robot is infallible.  In the trial, carried out on live animals in the operating theatre and on tissue samples in the lab, the scientists had to supervise the robot and tweak what it was doing around 40% of the time.  Dr Kim said: "These are minor adjustments, very much like when you see your little baby starting to walk. We were a little nervous about it to make sure it does it the right way.  "It can be fully autonomous for the task we want to do."  He hopes robots like this could reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and save lives.  Mr Shafi Ahmed, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said it was a radical step to try to replace a surgeon with a machine, but not necessarily a bad one in certain situations.  "All humans make errors. We have emotions and we get tired, whereas robots are objective.  "We need to ask whether machines might be better at doing some parts of surgery.  "Obviously there are issues around the ethics and trust. At what point do you trust a robot? This study suggests autonomous robots can do quite complex processes competently."  Dr Kim says the technology could be used on patients within the next couple of years. And one day, it may be possible to carry out routine operations, such as gall bladder or appendix removals, from start to finish using robots.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36202622	Embryo study shows 'life's first steps'	Scientists say a breakthrough in growing embryos will improve fertility treatments and revolutionise knowledge of the earliest steps to human life.  For the first time, embryos have been grown past the point they would normally implant in the womb.  The research, in the UK and US, was halted just before the embryos reached the legal limit of 14-days old.  But in an ethically-charged move, some scientists have already called for the 14-day limit to be changed.  The earliest steps towards human life are largely a mystery, but the research in Nature and Nature Cell Biology, has been able to study embryos for longer than ever before.  About a week used to be the limit - with scientists able to grow a fertilised egg up to the stage it would normally implant into the womb.  But they have now found a way to chemically mimic the womb to allow an embryo to continue developing until the two week stage.  It requires a combination of a nutrient-rich medium and a structure the embryo can pretend to "implant" upon.  The experiments were deliberately ended at the 13-day stage - just before the legal limit, but far beyond anything that has been achieved before.  The research is already providing insight into how an embryo starts the process of organising itself into a human being.  It is a crucial time when many embryos acquire developmental defects or fail to implant.  For example the study has allowed scientists to see the formation of the epiblast in 10-day-old embryos.  It is a crucial and tiny cluster of cells that eventually forms the human being, while the cells surrounding it go on to make the placenta and yolk sac.  Prof Magdalena Zernicka Goetz, from the University of Cambridge, said she "couldn't remember being more happy" than succeeding in growing the embryos.  She told the BBC: "It actually allows us to understand the very first steps in our development at the time of implantation where the embryo, really for the first time, reorganises itself to form the future body.  "Those steps we didn't know before so it has enormous implication for reproductive technologies."  There is international agreement that experiments should not allow embryos to develop past 14 days.  This research is pushing right up against the legal limits and some scientists are already making the case for the 14-day limit to be reviewed.  Prof Azim Surani, from the Gurdon Institute, said: "In my opinion, there has been a case to allow culture beyond 14 days even before these papers appeared. "  The 14-day limit is decades old and is thought to represent the first point at which an embryo becomes an "individual" as it can no longer form a twin.  But Prof Daniel Brison, from the University of Manchester, argued: "Given the potential benefits of new research in infertility, improving assisted conception methods, and in early miscarriage and disorders of pregnancy, there may be a case in the future to reconsider this."  The Nuffield Council of Bioethics - which played a prominent role in the debate around three-person babies - has announced it will review the issue.  It is an area that could spark huge ethical debate in the coming years.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36203093	Elections watchdog seeks more time for Tory probe	The Electoral Commission has met with police and prosecutors to ask for more time to decide on any criminal investigations into the Conservatives' 2015 election campaign spending.  The party has admitted failing to declare £38,000 of general election expenses for accommodation costs, blaming an "administrative error".  The deadline for any prosecutions is 12 months from the date of any offence.  The Electoral Commission is hoping for an extension of at least a month.  The Conservatives said they failed to register what was paid to put up Tory activists involved in the party's Battlebus operation - following a Channel 4 investigation.  David Cameron said the tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  Bob Posner, director of party and election finance and legal counsel at the Electoral Commission, said: "The police and the CPS both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place.  "We have requested that they consider doing this."  The commission says it does not take any view on whether charges should be brought.  But if no extension is sought, the ability to do so will expire a year after the submission of returns - which had to be with the Electoral Commission within 35 days of the election on 7 May 2015.  An extension can be sought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown Prosecution Service said afterwards that the meeting was constructive, and individual police forces will now consider what action to take in response.  Making a false declaration in relation to candidate spending carries a punishment of up to a year in jail and/or an unlimited fine - and anyone found guilty is barred from standing for election as an MP or holding elected office for three years.  No police investigation has yet been launched, but the commission says it seems "sensible for the criminal justice agencies to retain the ability to take action should appropriate evidence come to light as part of the commission's own investigation".	politics

Scientists deliberately gave mosquitoes the Wolbachia bug and then later exposed them to Zika virus.  They found mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia had less Zika virus in them and in some cases the virus had been inactivated.  They say with more work, the approach could be one way to prevent mosquitoes passing Zika on to humans.  Scientists around the world are working on ways to combat Zika - which has been linked to a rise in brain and skull malformations in babies.  The virus is thought to spread when humans are bitten by mosquitoes carrying Zika.  In this study, researchers from Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation found mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia (a bacterium that lives in many insects) had fewer copies Zika in their bodies and, crucially, an inactive form of Zika in their saliva.  They say the inactive form of Zika would not be able to cause disease in humans.  Writing in the journal Cell Host and Microbe, the scientists say they are unsure exactly how the overall strategy works but the virus and bacterium may compete for the same resources once inside mosquitoes - and the virus loses out.  They predict mosquitoes with Wolbachia - if released into the wild - would mate with mosquitoes without the bug and, over time, replace the population with Zika-resistant mosquitoes.  But scientists caution this strategy could not be used on its own.  Researcher Dr Luciano Moreira said: "We know that there will not be only one solution for Zika - we have to do this alongside different approaches, like vaccines or insecticides, besides the public measures to control mosquito breeding sites."  Dr Tom Walker, a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has worked on other programmes involving the Wolbachia bug, said this was early but promising work.  He added: "As this work is preliminary and has been done in a laboratory, one of the next steps would be to conduct a large trial outside of the laboratory."  Zika virus disease has been seen in more than 40 countries during the current outbreak.	health

The MP was suspended by Labour last week and apologised to the Commons for endorsing calls in 2014 for Israel to be moved to the United States.  The comments triggered a wider row over alleged anti-Semitism within the party, with an inquiry now under way.  Keith Vaz, the chair of the committee, said Ms Shah would not take part in its meetings for the time being.  The committee is beginning an inquiry into the extent of anti-Semitism in the UK and will call Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London who was suspended from Labour for suggesting Adolf Hitler was a Zionist, among its witnesses.  Mr Vaz said Ms Shah - the MP for Bradford West who was elected to Parliament in May 2015 - had requested not to be involved in this inquiry or the committee's other activities for the time being.  "Naz Shah has informed me and the committee that she wishes to stand aside from all her duties until current matters are resolved," he said.  "We have accepted her decision. She will not take part in any future matters concerning the Home Affairs Select Committee with immediate effect."  Mr Corbyn has asked the former head of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, to lead an inquiry into the extent of anti-Semitism and "other forms of racism" in the party. No timeframe has been given for when its findings will be published.

He said his party was on course to win its first ever seats in Cardiff - where it is campaigning heavily - and in the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies.  It was "50-50" whether the party would gain representation in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, he said.  He declined to put a target on UKIP gains in English council elections.  UKIP is campaigning on multiple fronts as it seeks to become the only UK party to get people elected to the National Assembly of Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Greater London Assembly.  The party has focused much of its time and resources in Wales, where it won 13% of the vote in last year's general election.  Opinion polls suggest UKIP is set to win seats for the first time despite a row over its candidate selection process.  Mr Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics: "There will be a breakthrough in Wales. I think we are going to win five seats - we may do slightly better than that. Let's see."  As for England, Mr Farage would not be drawn on how many seats it would gain but said its record in local government was a good one and he predicted it would consolidate its position in its existing strongholds in Essex and South Yorkshire.  "We will make gains. To try and guess how many is virtually impossible. In Thurrock, I think we will become the biggest party on that council, in Rotherham we have a chance of becoming the biggest party on that council.  "There are 500 local UKIP councillors. Our local base is growing, the people who have had elected have behaved, on the whole, pretty well and been very diligent and worked very hard. Yes, we will improve."  There has been speculation about the future of the party, and a possible change in direction, whatever the outcome of June's referendum on EU membership.  Mr Farage said if there was a narrow vote to stay in the EU, a lot of Conservative and Labour supporters would be unable to reconcile themselves with the result and their party leadership's stance and UKIP could find itself "a lot bigger than it is now".  If there was a vote to leave, he said UKIP would need to "stay around" to ensure that the people's will was "implemented" but he conceded that it would need to show it could talk about issues other than Europe.  And he rejected suggestions that UKIP - which only managed to get one MP elected in last year's general election despite winning 12% of the vote - was treading water nationally, citing a recent YouGov opinion poll which put it on 20%.

He said the "golden circle of the media establishment" was "obsessed" with leadership questions, whereas voters were more concerned with inequality.  Pollsters have suggested Labour could lose about 150 seats.  Mr Corbyn also said an anti-Semitism row in Labour was being "dealt with".  He pointed to an inquiry led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of campaign group Liberty, and said "only a very small number" of cases of anti-Semitism had been identified to date.  On Thursday, Labour will be defending the large council gains it made in 2012, the last time the seats were contested.  "We are not going to lose seats," Mr Corbyn told the BBC as he launched his party's election poster.  "We are looking to gain seats where we can, but these elections are being fought on the issues of every different community across the country."  Mr Corbyn overwhelmingly won last year's Labour leadership vote despite lacking the support of most of the party's MPs.  On Sunday, Mr Corbyn's ally Len McCluskey said the anti-Semitism row was being used by opponents of Mr Corbyn within Labour to undermine his leadership.  Asked about reports of a possible leadership challenge, Mr Corbyn said: "I'm here. I'm going on," replying "of course" when asked if he would stand in a leadership contest if there was another one.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36168717	Breast cancer: Scientists hail 'milestone' genetic find	Scientists say they now have a near-perfect picture of the genetic events that cause breast cancer.  The study, published in Nature, has been described as a "milestone" moment that could help unlock new ways of treating and preventing the disease.  The largest study of its kind unpicked practically all the errors that cause healthy breast tissue to go rogue.  Cancer Research UK said the findings were an important stepping-stone to new drugs for treating cancer.  To understand the causes of the disease, scientists have to understand what goes wrong in our DNA that makes healthy tissue turn cancerous.  The international team looked at all 3 billion letters of people's genetic code - their entire blueprint of life - in 560 breast cancers.  They uncovered 93 sets of instructions, or genes, that if mutated, can cause tumours. Some have been discovered before, but scientists expect this to be the definitive list, barring a few rare mutations.  Prof Sir Mike Stratton, the director of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge which led the study, said it was a "milestone" in cancer research.  He told the BBC: "There are about 20,000 genes in the human genome. It turns out, now we have this complete view of breast cancer - there are 93 of those [genes] that if mutated will convert a normal breast cell into a breast cancer cell. That is an important piece of information.  "We hand that list over to the universities, the pharmaceuticals, the biotech companies to start developing new drugs because those mutated genes and their proteins are targets for new therapeutics.  "There are now many drugs that have been developed over the last 15 years against such targets which we know work."  Targeted drugs such as Herceptin are already being used by patients with specific mutations.  Prof Stratton expects new drugs will still take at least a decade to reach patients and warns: "Cancers are devious beasts and they work out ways of developing resistance to new therapeutics so overall I'm optimistic, but it's a tempered optimism."  There is also bad news in the data - 60% of the mutations driving cancer are found in just 10 genes.  At the other end of the spectrum, there are mutations so rare they are in just a tiny fraction of cancers meaning it is unlikely there will be any financial incentive to develop therapies.  But why do those genes mutate in the first place?  Mutations leave unique scars - known as mutational signatures - on our DNA and that allowed the team to identify 12 types of damage that cause mutations in the breast.  Some are related to family risk, but most are still unexplained.  One class of mutation seems to stem from the body attacking viruses by mutating their genetic code, but also suffering collateral damage in the process.  Whether any of these processes can be altered is still unknown in this nascent field, but researchers hope the findings could eventually lead to ways of reducing the risk of cancers.  Dr Serena Nik-Zainal, another researcher at the Sanger Institute, added: "In the future, we'd like to be able to profile individual cancer genomes so that we can identify the treatment most likely to be successful for a woman or man diagnosed with breast cancer.  "It is a step closer to personalised health care for cancer."  Dr Emma Smith, from Cancer Research UK, said: "This study brings us closer to getting a complete picture of the genetic changes at the heart of breast cancer and throws up intriguing clues about the key biological processes that go wrong in cells and drive the disease.  "Understanding these underlying processes has already led to more effective treatments for patients, so genetic studies on this scale could be an important stepping stone towards developing new drugs and boosting the number of people who survive cancer."	health

In a study on mice, Hsp90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments.  This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers, the research team said.  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK.  About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It mainly affects men over the age of 50.  The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens.  But some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment.  This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers.  The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors.  Professor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery.  "We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway.  "These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance."  Prof Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer.  Prof Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: "These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36180572	Len McCluskey: Anti-Semitism row used to undermine Corbyn	A row about anti-Semitism is being used by Jeremy Corbyn's opponents within Labour to undermine his leadership, Unite chief Len McCluskey says.  Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour's biggest donor, attacked a "cynical attempt to manipulate anti-Semitism for political aims".  Another Corbyn ally, Diane Abbott, said party members had been "smeared".  It comes after controversial comments by ex-mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Naz Shah saw both suspended from the party.  Mr Corbyn told a May Day rally in London his party stood "absolutely against anti-Semitism in any form".  Mr Livingstone, the former London mayor, was suspended from the party after saying Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s "before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews".  Speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 live, Mr McCluskey said Labour had been right to suspend Mr Livingstone for his "bizarre" comments.  But he described the wider controversy as "mood music" being exploited by political enemies of Mr Corbyn.  The Unite chief said the row had been "got up" by the right-wing press, "aided and abetted by those Labour MPs who wake up and think what stick can we beat Jeremy with?"  He is in charge of the union which donates the most money to Labour. And he sees the row over anti-Semitism as part of wider attempts to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - not just from the "right wing press", as he calls it, but from Labour MPs.  He knows some prominent party members are prepared to blame their own party leadership for what they expect to be poor election results this week.  So he is firing a shot across their bows to dissuade any of them from launching a leadership challenge.  The nature of the challenge is far from certain - Jeremy Corbyn's opponents have been described by one insider as "rival militias" who can't agree on an alternative, or on the timing of an assault.  But it would be wrong entirely to conflate the anti-Semitism controversy with anti-Corbyn plotting.  The anger some MPs feel over the handling of the issue isn't synthetic, and they fear it has harmed the party's reputation and not just that of the leader.  Mr McCluskey said he did not think there would be a formal leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn, but added that any MP "stupid enough to try" would have to "be accountable for their actions".  Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Abbott, the shadow international development secretary, said Mr Livingstone's remarks had been "extremely offensive", but defended the party's handling of the row.  She said there had been 12 reported cases of alleged anti-Semitism within the party since Mr Corbyn became leader, and each had led to a suspension - including Mr Livingstone who was suspended "within hours".  "It's something of a smear against ordinary members to say the party has a problem with anti-Semitism," she said.  But Labour's candidate for Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned the row engulfing his party had harmed his chances of being elected.  Mr Khan told the Observer Mr Livingstone's comments had made it "more difficult" for Jewish voters to support him in next week's election.  Labour is holding an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in its ranks - but the leadership's response to the allegations has been criticised by some Labour MPs.  Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, ex-minister Ben Bradshaw told the Sunday Politics members were "furious" at how the situation had been handled, and Labour MP Louise Ellman said the response had been "much too slow".  Ms Ellman, who is Jewish, said she had been subject to anti-Semitic abuse herself at a meeting of the local party. A complaint is being investigated.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World this Weekend, Labour donor Michael Foster, who gave the party £400,000 before the general election where he also stood as a candidate, said some members of the party's leadership "vilify Jews as part of their political shtick".  He called for the inquiry, led by former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, to be widened, and said he would not donate to the party nationally because of the leadership's approach.  Senior figures within Israeli politics also expressed their concerns about the party.  The new Israeli ambassador to London said elements of left-wing parties were "deluding themselves" if they presumed there was no problem with anti-Semitism.  Mark Regev said comments in the last few weeks had crossed from criticism of Israeli government policies to "demonising and a vilification of" the Jewish state and perpetuating racist stereotypes.  Israel's Labour leader Isaac Herzog also said he had been "appalled and outraged by the recent examples of anti-Semitism by senior Labour Party officials".  Mr Livingstone's comments were "horrific and unthinkable for a British politician in the 21st Century", he added.  The anti-Semitism row erupted last week when Bradford West MP Naz Shah was suspended after sharing a Facebook post suggesting Israel should be moved to America.  Mr Livingstone defended her in a BBC interview, saying that she was not anti-Semitic.  He went on to say: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel."  Mr Livingstone was subsequently suspended but stood by his comments, saying he was "not sorry for telling the truth".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36177333	Ken Livingstone stands by Hitler comments	Ken Livingstone has stood by his recent comments about Hitler, saying he was "not sorry for telling the truth".  He said he "regretted" the disruption his comments had caused but "I believe what I said is true".  The former London mayor was suspended from the Labour party on Thursday after saying Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s.  He made the comments while defending Labour MP Naz Shah over accusations she was anti-Semitic.  During an interview on LBC, Mr Livingstone repeatedly refused to apologise for making the comments, saying he was sorry if his views had upset Jewish people but he had simply made a "statement of fact" that had also been made by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  "I never regret saying something that is true," he said.  "How can I have hurt and offended the Jewish community when the prime minister of Israel said exactly the same thing?"  "If you look at what this is all about, it's not about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party... What this is all about is actually the struggle of the embittered old Blairite MPs to try to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn."  Labour is to hold an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in its ranks.  It said the inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of human rights campaign group Liberty, would consult with the Jewish community and other minority groups, after claims a strain of party members held anti-Semitic views.  The row erupted after Ms Shah was found to have made comments on Facebook before becoming an MP, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States. She later apologised and was suspended from the party.  But Mr Livingstone defended the Bradford West MP, saying anti-Zionism was not the same as anti-Semitism.  He told BBC London: "When Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him in front of TV cameras of being a "Nazi apologist".  And he was later suspended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  Mr Corbyn tweeted on Saturday: "There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of racism in the Labour Party, or anywhere in society."  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "I just wish Ken would have apologised for some of the offence that he's caused. I know he's said he regrets what he's said, but I think he should now apologise."  The row comes less than a week before local elections in England, and for the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Mr Livingstone, who has been a close ally of Mr Corbyn and his left-wing ideals, said he believed the attacks against him were coming from the right-wing of the party and were really aimed at undermining the leadership.  "The really appalling thing here is dishonest MPs who know that what I said is true have stirred up all this nonsense because they want to damage our chances at the local election so they then have a chance of undermining Jeremy."  Shadow cabinet minister Jonathan Ashworth said it was Mr Livingstone who was undermining Mr Corbyn, and urged him to "put a sock in it".  He told the BBC: "I was offended by Ken's remarks. I think Ken crossed a line. I'm not a bitter former Blairite... I am proud to serve in Jeremy's shadow cabinet."  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu provoked widespread criticism in October when he said a Palestinian leader persuaded the Nazis to carry out the Holocaust.  Mr Netanyahu insisted Adolf Hitler had only wanted to expel Jews from Europe, but that Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini had told him: "Burn them."  However, the chief historian at Israel's memorial to the Holocaust said this account was factually incorrect.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36175660	Labour anti-Semitism row: Jeremy Corbyn to launch inquiry	Jeremy Corbyn is to hold an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party.  The inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of campaign group Liberty, will consult with the Jewish community and other minority groups, Labour said.  Mr Corbyn will also propose a new "code of conduct" on racism at Labour's national executive committee in May.  It comes after the party suspended MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone amid anti-Semitism claims.  The code of conduct will include guidance on "acceptable behaviour and use of language" and make "explicitly clear for the first time that Labour will not tolerate any form of racism, including anti-Semitism, in the party", a statement said.  The inquiry's vice-chairman will be Professor David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism.  The inquiry, which will report in two months, will set out "clear and transparent" rules on how the party should deal with allegations of racism and anti-Semitism and propose training programmes for parliamentary candidates, MPs and councillors.  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said Jeremy Corbyn would be hoping the announcement would "calm what was now a very angry, volatile atmosphere within his party".  Mr Corbyn said Labour was an anti-racist party "to its core", and the Jewish community had been at the heart of the Labour party and progressive politics in Britain for more than 100 years.  "There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of racism in the Labour party, or anywhere in society, and we will make sure that our party is a welcoming home to members of all communities," he said.  The Labour leader said he had taken "decisive action" over any such allegations since he became leader.  The row, which comes less than a week before local elections in England, and for the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, exploded on Thursday when Mr Livingstone claimed Hitler supported Zionism "before he went mad".  He made the comments in an interview with BBC Radio London, in which he defended Ms Shah, the party's MP for Bradford West.  Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative candidate for London Mayor, said it was "not a Ken Livingstone problem - it's a Labour party problem".  He told the BBC: "There is a streak running through the Labour party - I don't think the Labour party even denies it - where anti-Semitism of the most aggressive form has become normalised."  There will be those Labour MPs who welcome the inquiry as measurable progress, but will it satisfy Jeremy Corbyn's most committed critics? No it won't.  They don't trust his instincts. They remember him sharing platforms in the past with militants from Hamas, or from Iran.  They resent the fact he draws support from some far-left individuals and groups who have been associated with anti-Semitism in the past.  More fundamentally, this is just one component of a charge sheet for them that touches on Jeremy Corbyn's pure left instincts and his basic competence.  The tension beneath the surface between these rival groups in the Labour Party borders and crosses over into hatred.  It will come to the surface after the local and national elections next week and will likely boil over when the European referendum is settled one way or another in June.  Ms Shah was suspended on Wednesday over comments on Facebook, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States. She later apologised.  In the interview, Mr Livingstone said: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him of being a "Nazi apologist" in front of TV cameras.  And Jonathan Ashworth, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, told BBC Radio 4 that Mr Livingstone's comments were "deeply offensive, it was vile".  Labour MP Ruth Smeeth said it had been a "horrendous" week for the party but hoped the inquiry would "help us now rebuild".  Mr Livingstone was suspended by Mr Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  Anushka Asthana, political editor at the Guardian, who was following Mr Corbyn for an interview on the day the row erupted, told the BBC the Labour leader tried to carry on with his planned visits before advisors made it clear he needed to take action.  "It was obviously quite a difficult thing for him to do... he is an old friend of Ken Livingstone," she said.  "[Labour] had to set up this inquiry because of all the questions, but there is a reluctance, I think, among the inner circle to accept that all of this is around anti-Semitism. But they have to shut this down. There is fury throughout the party."  Jonathan Sacerdoti, from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, welcomed Mr Corbyn's inquiry but said the party was still reacting too slowly.  "We've seen more and more of these stories coming out about people in the Labour party, and it can't be denied that the modern left has within it a strain that does seem to have anti-Semitic views.  "That's a problem the Labour Party has been very slow to acknowledge and very slow to deal with."  On Friday, Mr Livingstone told Sky News he would make his case citing a book by controversial American Marxist historian Lenni Brenner, who he met in the 1980s.  "I'll just produce the evidence... it's hard for somebody to decide to suspend me from the party here when all this was there 30 years ago in the public domain and nobody raised a peep," he said.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36170259	Worsening depression 'may predict dementia risk'	Symptoms of depression that steadily increase over time in older age could indicate early signs of dementia, scientists have said.  Other patterns of symptoms, such as chronic depression, appear not to be linked, a study found.  Dutch researchers looked at different ways depression in older adults progressed over time and how this related to any risk.  They concluded worsening depression may signal the condition is taking hold.  The research, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, followed more than 3,000 adults aged 55 and over living in the Netherlands.  All had depression but no symptoms of dementia at the start of the study.  Dr M Arfan Ikram of the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam said depressive symptoms that gradually increase over time appear to be a better predictor of dementia later in life than other paths of depression.  "There are a number of potential explanations, including that depression and dementia may both be symptoms of a common underlying cause, or that increasing depressive symptoms are on the starting end of a dementia continuum in older adults," he said.  Only the group whose symptoms of depression increased over time were found to be at increased risk of dementia - about one in five of people (55 out of 255) in this group developed dementia.  Others who had symptoms that waxed and waned or stayed the same were not at increased risk.  For example, in those who experienced low but stable levels of depression, around 10% went on to develop dementia.  The exact nature of depression on dementia risk remains unknown.  They often occur together, but the Dutch study is among the first to look at different patterns of depression symptoms.  Dr Simone Reppermund from the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, said more studies were needed to understand the link.  "A focus on lifestyle factors such as physical activity and social networks, and biological risk factors such as vascular disease, neuroinflammation, high concentrations of stress hormones, and neuropathological changes, might bring new treatment and prevention strategies a step closer," she wrote in a linked editorial in the journal.  Depression varies greatly from one person to another. Some experience depressive symptoms only briefly, others have remitting and relapsing depression and some people are depressed all the time.  Dr Simon Ridley, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said anyone concerned about either condition should seek help.  "The findings suggest that low levels of depression or fluctuating symptoms may not affect dementia risk but that a worsening of symptoms in the over-55s may be an early indicator of diseases like Alzheimer's," he said.  "It's important to remember that only a relatively small number of people experiencing symptoms of depression went on to develop dementia during this 11-year study, but anyone concerned about either condition should talk to their GP."	health

After the "Stair Wars" in which a Labour MP waged running verbal combat with Ken Livingstone, and ignited questions about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the warring factions have suddenly fallen all but silent.  Peace, though, has not broken out. Anything but.  It's a momentary ceasefire. On both sides, people are keeping their heads down - judging it too dangerous to speak up.  Today, Jeremy Corbyn cancelled his campaigning trip to Wales to avoid unwanted media attention. Media attention is supposed to be the point!  The First Minister of Wales, Carwen Jones, admitted Mr Corbyn isn't a hit with everyone on the doorsteps.  "Yes there are some people saying to me I'm unsure about Jeremy Corbyn. There are others who take the opposite view. What we are finding is that fewer and fewer people are mentioning him on the doorstep."  Mr Corbyn's critics - and enemies - are also keeping quiet.  In private their mood is ferocious.  They want Ken Livingstone expelled, and Mr Corbyn to take anti-Semitism in the party more seriously. So why the phoney peace?  Behind the scenes, fear is spreading of what some expect to be poor results for Labour in Thursday's elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities.  "Outside London, it's looking dire," one told me.  And now, Mr Corbyn's enemies - who are under constant watch by the leaders' allies - are anxious to avoid being blamed for making things worse by showing disloyalty to their embattled leader.  They expect those accusations to be levelled anyway.  There's mutual suspicion and hostility bordering on hatred between the rival wings and factions of the Labour Party.  It's been a messy, chaotic few days. Acrimonious in public, worse in private.  Some action is coming on Labour's approach to racism and anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn will speak out. Rules changes explicitly declaring zero tolerance of racism look likely.  But there are fears a good deal of damage has already been done, and the Labour Party will pay a price at the polls.  The election results, when they come, will inevitably subjected to rival, probably diametrically opposing interpretations within the Labour Party.  But from all I'm hearing from sources in the opposing camps, anything that can be read as a poor night in Thursday's elections will escalate the in-fighting to a new pitch.  A fierce confrontation over Labour's future direction and leadership now looks unavoidable.	politics

The Lib Dem leader conceded his party had "a battle" on its hands.  But he said Labour's woes present it with a "huge opportunity" to show itself as "an effective opposition".  He claims membership has increased by 50% since last year's general election, when the party was nearly wiped out at Westminster.  In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Farron said the elections were "important UK-wide" because the country is faced with "a divided and divisive Labour Party when we ought to be talking about a Conservative Party that's attacking junior doctors, reducing police numbers and effectively privatising our schools".  Told that voters do not know who he is, Mr Farron said: "That's the job we have got. We've got a battle to get back to the centre of British politics and people's attentions and we can only do that by winning some elections."  He said it took former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown two to three years to get 50% name recognition.  "The point is you don't get prissy or pompous or selfish about this, you roll your sleeves up and get things done, and frankly given the state of Britain's most ineffective opposition in living memory - the Labour Party - it's in the interests of British democracy that the Lib Dems recover next Thursday. I hope we will."  Mr Farron also defended his party's use of the House of Lords to defeat government legislation despite describing it as "undemocratic".  "We don't agree with first past the post or the way the House of Commons is elected but it's the system we've got so we will use it."  Britain goes to the polls on Thursday in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years.

Labour was considering changes to its rules to send "a clear signal" of its "zero tolerance" towards anti-Semitism.  Mr Livingstone was suspended after claiming Hitler supported Zionism "before he went mad".  Labour has been beset in recent weeks by growing claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks.  Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said allegations must be dealt with "much more speedily in the future".  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  He told BBC One's Question Time on Thursday that he did not think the party was anti-Semitic but added: "These allegations, when they are surfacing, have not been dealt with properly and quickly enough."  But Mr Watson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that party leader Jeremy Corbyn did "act swiftly" to suspend his ally of 40 years, Mr Livingstone.  He said Mr Livingstone's comments were "vile" adding: "To link Hitler and Zionism in the way he did must have been designed to create offence." But he said it was for Labour's ruling national executive committee to decide whether to expel him from the party.  What is most satisfying for Jeremy Corbyn's internal opponents is that they feel they have found a "wedge" issue to detach him from some of his support.  Many of his MPs don't like his views on a range of issues but to attack him for - for example - wanting to scrap nuclear weapons merely strengthens his support amongst newer, more left-wing members.  But while some of those members may have made offensive comments, many, many more despise anti-Semitism - so Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to those accused of it will be scrutinised closely by them.  The anti-Semitism row could yet become the "soft underbelly" of his leadership.  In the meantime Mr Watson said he and Mr Corbyn had been looking at whether "Labour's own structures" needed changing "to make sure that we send a very clear signal to people in our party that we will have a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism".  "Do we need to change our rules to explicitly rule out racism and specifically include anti-Semitism in that?" he said.  "We are going to deal with this."  Meanwhile BBC Wales understands that Mr Corbyn cancelled a visit to Wales, where Labour activists are campaigning ahead of the assembly elections, amid fears it would be overshadowed by the anti-Semitism row.  The row exploded on Thursday after a radio interview that Mr Livingstone did with BBC Radio London, defending Naz Shah, the party's MP for Bradford West, who had been suspended on Wednesday over comments on Facebook.  In it he said: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him of being a "Nazi apologist" in front of TV cameras. Other Labour MPs condemned Mr Livingstone's comments.  He was later suspended by Mr Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  On Friday, Mr Livingstone told Sky News he would make his case citing a book by controversial American Marxist historian Lenni Brenner, who he met in the 1980s.  "I'll just produce the evidence and I mean it's hard for somebody to decide to suspend me from the party here when all this was there 30 years ago in the public domain and nobody raised a peep," he said.  Labour peer Lord Sugar said Mr Livingstone had "lost the plot" and was "obsessed with Hitler, concentration camps and Jews".  "They will wait for it to blow over a little bit and they will find some way of him coming back in, slipping back into the Labour fold," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.  But Jon Lansman, chairman of Momentum, a grassroots network of Corbyn supporters, said that while Mr Livingstone's comments were "very ill-judged, wrong and offensive" to "call Ken a Nazi apologist is ridiculous".  He said: "Just as the Tories have an interest in stoking up the flames of whatever crisis is here... largely a crisis of perception... so do some people in the Labour Party and I'm afraid John Mann is one of them. John Mann is no supporter of Jeremy Corbyn."  On Wednesday Ms Shah was suspended, pending an investigation, over comments she made on Facebook before she became an MP, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States.  She has apologised but it has prompted claims from senior Labour figures that the party was not doing enough to tackle growing anti-Semitism in its ranks.	politics

Mr Hammond is the first UK foreign secretary to travel to the Caribbean country in an official capacity since its communist revolution in 1959.  He said there would be new "co-operation agreements" on energy, finance, education and culture.  Mr Hammond's two-day visit follows one by US President Barack Obama in March.  As with all visiting dignitaries, Mr Hammond's first stop was in Revolution Square, Havana, to lay a wreath for the island's independence hero, Jose Marti.  He then held talks with his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla.  The foreign secretary is taking part in a series of meetings to discuss social and economic changes, human rights and the fight against global health threats such as the Zika virus.  He will also sign a bilateral agreement restructuring Cuba's debt to the UK.  "Britain and Cuba have outlooks on the world and systems of government that are very different," Mr Hammond said as he arrived in the capital, Havana.  "But as Cuba enters a period of significant social and economic change, I am looking forward to demonstrating to the Cuban government and people that the UK is keen to forge new links across the Atlantic."  BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent Will Grant says increased trade is the main focus of the visit, with UK businesses looking to build links with Cuba's tourism, agriculture and financial services industries.  Cuba's largest trading partners are Venezuela and China. European Commission data shows Spain is the largest exporter to Cuba from the EU, with trade totalling nearly £750m last year.  UK exports were £25m in 2015, £19m in 2014 and £22m in 2013.  According to UK Trade & Investment, the top British products exported to Cuba came from the dairy, pharmaceutical, paper, drinks, optical, aluminium, and machinery sectors.  It says the UK remains under-represented in the market compared with other EU nations, although "significant trade" of products goes through third countries.  Last month Mr Obama became the first US president since 1928 to visit Cuba.  For years, the US and Cuba were engaged in a bitter stand-off, triggered by the overthrow of US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista by Communist leader Fidel Castro in 1959.  The US broke off diplomatic relations and imposed a trade embargo.	politics

And the people we will take out are all close to Corbyn."  That's what a Labour MP confided to me more than a week before Naz Shah's Facebook activities were exposed.  There is no suggestion that this particular MP was involved - and equally no suggestion that the shock felt by long standing Labour Party members at anti-Semitic comments by newer recruits is synthetic.  But for those opposed to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the week could hardly have gone better.  There is a consensus that anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is not widespread.  That contributed to Jeremy Corbyn's unfortunate "crisis? What crisis?," comments which suggested to some that he wasn't serious enough about tackling a small but highly toxic problem before it became a big and highly toxic problem.  At a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, concerns were expressed that the wrong impression was being given and that there had to be swifter and more pro-active action to root out anti-Semitism.  So Jeremy Corbyn's failure to suspend Naz Shah ahead of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday - allowing David Cameron to berate him - allowed the Labour leader's critics to question the competence of his leadership as well as the substance of the issue.  But Ken Livingstone's remarks on Hitler and Zionism were a bonus.  Because this has already set off a chain reaction of challenges for the Labour leadership.  It has forced Jeremy Corbyn to use disciplinary procedures, which he dislikes.  He fought against the "witch hunt" and expulsion of ultra-Leftists in the 1980s, and as leader he wants to open Labour's doors to those to the left of the party to help build a more radical party and movement.  But now his critics are forcing him to at least lay the foundations of the walls to be built around Labour's broad church and to make clear some people, and some views, just aren't welcome.  This, in turn, is likely to make him look weak in the eyes of some of his supporters who joined Labour in order to vote for him as leader.  Then there is the question of what happens to Ken Livingstone - seen as a close supporter of the leader - after he has been investigated by party officials.  If he isn't expelled, Jeremy Corbyn again will be portrayed as soft on anti-Semitism - a charge which deeply offends him.  If Livingstone is expelled, not only will Jeremy Corbyn have lost an articulate high-profile ally, some on the left will be dismayed that the party leader hasn't been clear enough about the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, potentially opening up the possibility of a further purge of supporters.  That said, it was significant that Jon Lansman - a key figure in the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement -has not attempted to defend the former London mayor.  But then Tom Watson - the deputy leader with his own mandate - publicly fretted over the potential loss of seats in the forthcoming local elections in England because of the current adverse publicity.  Some Labour MPs are already planning to denounce a poor performance after these elections and they have just been handed more ammunition.  Pressure is also likely to mount on Jeremy Corbyn to distance himself not just from Ken Livingstone but from his own views.  When he met the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews in February, Mr Corbyn said he would "reflect" on the request not to meet representatives of Hamas or Hezbollah as Labour leader.  His critics feel there now has been enough time for reflection and are calling for a decisive statement.  But what is most satisfying for his internal opponents is that they feel they have found a "wedge" issue to detach him from some of his support.  Many of his MPs don't like his views on a range of issues but to attack him for - for example - wanting to scrap nuclear weapons merely strengthens his support amongst newer, more left-wing members.  But while some of those members may have made offensive comments, many, many more despise anti-Semitism - so Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to those accused of it will be scrutinised closely by them.  The anti-Semitism row could yet become the "soft underbelly" of his leadership.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36169654	Q&A: Labour anti-Semitism row	It began on Tuesday when the Guido Fawkes political gossip site discovered Facebook posts made by Naz Shah, Labour's MP for Bradford West, in 2014, before she became an MP. She had shared a graphic showing Israel's outline on a map of the United States with the comment "problem solved". She was accused of anti-Semitism. She quit her role as an aide to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. She apologised to MPs on Wednesday, acknowledging "I have made a mistake". She added: "I accept and understand that the words I used caused upset and hurt to the Jewish community and I deeply regret that. Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relationships between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none." She was suspended from the party.  On Thursday, Ken Livingstone defended Naz Shah in a BBC interview, saying that she was not anti-Semitic.  He went on to say: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews." This was roundly condemned and led to a televised confrontation with a furious John Mann, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's all-party group against anti-Semitism.  The former London mayor's explosive comments prompted a wave of criticism from Labour figures and calls for his suspension. Leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended him, saying: "There were grave concerns about the language he used. We had a discussion about it and decided we would suspend him and he would go through an investigation by the party." It is now up to the party's ruling National Executive Committee to decide whether he should be expelled.  Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner, after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name. He has divided opinion since his time as leader of the Greater London Council in the 1980s. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was Mr Livingstone who invented the "loony left". Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was "ahead of his time". Profile: Ken Livingstone  Mr Livingstone denied suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding the Nazi leader was "a monster from start to finish" and claimed to have been quoting historical "facts". But in an angry confrontation, Mr Mann shouted: "You're a Nazi apologist, you're rewriting history. Go back and check what Hitler did." Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: "What Ken Livingstone deliberately did was to draw an equation between Nazism and Zionism. He therefore crossed a line into what certainly most people would regard as distinctly anti-Semitic." Livingstone Hitler comments 'inaccurate'  Anti-Semitism is "hostility and prejudice directed against Jewish people" according to the OED while Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, corresponding to the historic land of Israel. Some say the word "Zionist" can be used as a coded attack on Jews others, including Ken Livingstone, say anti-Zionism is not the same as anti-Semitism and criticism of Israeli government policy should not be conflated with anti-Jewish prejudice. What is the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  Labour's leaders say the party has a proud history of fighting racism and promoting racial equality - and the party's MPs would be horrified to belong to an organisation that was anti-Semitic. But it has faced accusations of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. In April, Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz was suspended from the party over a message on her Twitter account that Hitler was "the greatest man in history". The month before, it suspended activist Vicki Kirby for a second time following criticism of her reinstatement - posts on her Twitter page included one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God". Labour peer Baroness Royall is also looking into claims of anti-Semitism at Oxford University Labour club. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn says: "Anybody that thinks this party is not cracking down on anti-Semitism is simply wrong. We have suspended where appropriate, we've investigated all cases. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form in our party.'	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36168487	EU referendum: Sir John Major in North Korea Brexit claim	Sir John Major has told those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU to "go to North Korea" if they want "undiluted sovereignty".  The former Conservative prime minister said "splendid isolation" would leave the UK weaker.  And he warned of economic damage if the UK votes to leave in the 23 June referendum.  Vote Leave said Sir John had been "wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years" and was wrong now.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir John said: "Day after day you have had the Brexit people producing soundbites that are either offensive or inaccurate or just plain silly.  "I don't believe that it is patriotic to argue for a case that is going to make this country weaker and is going to make the wellbeing of this country less certain in the future."  He went on: "To listen to them, you would think we are entrapped in the clutches of an evil empire, not in a democratic partnership with our European neighbours whose sunshine and pavement cafes we enjoy during holiday breaks."  The Leave campaign has said leaving the EU would restore sovereignty to the UK, freeing it from the influence of Brussels and the European Court of Justice, which oversees the application of EU-wide rules.  But Sir John said: "If you want undiluted sovereignty in the modern age, when everybody is interconnected, then go to North Korea because that is where you will get it.  "It is certainly true that we share sovereignty. We take some sovereignty from other people, we share some of ours.  "We haven't surrendered it because, at the end of the day, the House of Commons, our representatives, can say, 'We won't have this, we will leave the European Union.'  "But in the modern world, the modern world of interconnectivity, the modern world with the economy that now exists, you have to share sovereignty or you find yourself isolated and weaker."  Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: "John Major complained about soundbites before descending in hyperbole about North Korea without even a hint of self-awareness.  "John Major has been wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years. He said Britain should join the ERM - that was a disaster which cost 3 million their jobs.  "He signed us up to Maastricht saying it wouldn't give up sovereignty and he refused to rule out joining the euro.  "Now he doesn't want to take back control and stop handing Brussels £350m a week. He was wrong then and he is wrong now."  It comes as UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed he had been sidelined by Vote Leave, which is the officially designated campaign to get Britain out of the EU.  He said in a speech that Vote Leave was on the "back foot" because it had failed to focus on immigration - but it had rejected his offers of help.  "Every time I attempt to work with them I am rebuffed and rejected," he added.  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "We wish Nigel well."	politics

They found the first part of human DNA - the genetic code - that seems to affect how old people look to others.  The mutations, reported in the journal Current Biology, were in the genetic instructions for protecting the body from UV radiation.  But these can also lead to red hair, and experts caution the findings may be confused by eye, skin or hair colour.  The study into "perceived age" was organised by the Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands and Unilever.  Dr David Gunn, a senior scientist at the company, said perceived age was a phenomenon everyone was familiar with.  He told the BBC News website: "You meet two people you haven't seen for 10 years, and you happen to notice one doesn't look a day older than you remember and then the other person you think 'Wow what happened to them?'."  Images of the make-up free "naked-face" of 2,693 people were judged to assess how old people thought they looked. This was compared with their true age.  The next stage of the research was to scour the 2,693 people's DNA to find any differences or mutations that were more common in those who looked younger than they really were.  All the evidence pointed to the MC1R gene - it is critical for making melanin, which affects skin pigmentation and protects against UV radiation from the Sun.  But the gene comes in many different forms, or variants, one of which causes red hair - hence the nickname "the ginger gene".  The study suggested some variants of the gene led to people looking, on average, two years younger than those with other forms of MC1R.  Prof Manfred Kayser, from Erasmus, told the BBC News website: "The exciting part is we actually found the gene, and that we did find the first means we will be able to find more.  "It is exciting because this is a well known phenomenon that so far cannot be explained - why do some people look so much younger?"  However, the researchers cannot explain why MC1R has such an effect - they tested ideas that the different variants might alter skin damage from the sun, but this did not appear to be the case.  Prof Ian Jackson, from the UK Medical Research Council's Human Genetics Unit, said the study was interesting, but had not found the fountain of youth.  He said: "MC1R is the major gene involved in red hair and pale skin, and what they're trying to say is it's got an impact on making you look slightly younger that isn't to do with paler skin, but I'm not so sure."  The researchers say they adjusted their data to account for different skin tones.  But Prof Jackson said: "The question is how well are they adjusting for that - what about hair colour and eye colour - my gut reaction is what they're looking at is an aspect of pigmentation.  "I would suspect people who have paler pigmentation would look younger and that might be paler skin or bluer eyes or blonde or red hair."  More research is planned, but Dr Gunn hopes the findings will eventually lead to a product to make people look younger.  "This is the first genetic study ever of perceived age, ideally we'd want something to boost this gene for everybody," he said.  However, it is far from clear whether it will be possible to lower someone's "perceived age".  Also commenting on the study, Prof Tim Frayling, from the University of Exeter, said: "This is an interesting finding that shows how genetics can influence the ageing process independently of developing disease.  "However, whilst interesting, the authors admit that they need to find more genetic variation to have any chance of predicting someone's appearance from DNA alone."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36164115	Elections watchdog urges more time in Conservatives expenses probe	Police and prosecutors should ask for more time to decide whether to bring prosecutions over the Conservatives' 2015 election returns, says a watchdog.  The Electoral Commission said it "does not mean that it has any view" on whether charges should be brought.  It has invited several police forces to a meeting next week on the issue.  The Conservatives have admitted failing to declare £38,000 of general election expenses for accommodation costs, blaming an "administrative error".  They said they failed to register what was paid to put up Tory activists involved in the party's Battlebus operation - following a Channel 4 investigation.  The party said the tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  It says it was "some millions below" the spending threshold for the national campaign and would have had no reason not to declare it.  But Channel 4 said its investigation suggested the operation was focused at a local level, so should have been declared as such.  The deadline for any prosecutions is 12 months from the date of any offence, unless police or the director of public prosecutions apply to the courts for an extension.  The Electoral Commission is investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act for the 2015 general election and by-elections in Newark, Clacton and Rochester and Strood.  It has the power to fine parties over their national campaign spending - but it is up to the police to investigate or sanction local party candidates over local campaign spending under the Representation of the People Act.  The commission said its view was that "in the absence of any current investigation by the police, it would be sensible for the criminal justice agencies to retain the ability to take action, should appropriate evidence come to light as part of the commission's own investigation".  The Electoral Commission said it does not believe it will finish its investigation before the deadline for any potential offences under the Representation of the People Act expires.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17539320	Ken Livingstone: Profile of former London Mayor	Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by the Labour Party over comments he made while defending an MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row, has a had long and often controversial political career.  Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner, after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name. Another being his nemesis, and Conservative successor as mayor, Boris Johnson.  Like Mr Johnson, he cultivated a quirky public image, with his pet newts and appearances on chat shows. He even lent his nasal tones to a track on a best-selling Blur album.  His way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.  He was suspended from office as mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a "fuss about nothing". The suspension was overturned in court.  He has also been repeatedly criticised for his decision to welcome controversial Muslim cleric Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who condoned suicide bombings, to London in 2005. He said it was part of an effort to improve relations with the Muslim world.  He remains popular in left wing circles as one of the few genuine socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 mayoral contest, although he continued to be elected to Labour's ruling National Executive Committee.  He was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year.  The two go back a long way - they share the same political outlook and commitment to causes such as nuclear disarmament and Palestinian solidarity - and Mr Corbyn worked hard to get him to the top at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s.  Marital status: Married his long- term partner in 2009. Two children with current partner and three other children.  Time served as Mayor: Two terms from 2000-2008  Mr Corbyn drafted in advisers from Mr Livingstone's time in City Hall when he took on Labour's top job and Mr Livingstone himself became part of his inner circle.  Before long, the former London mayor was back on the airwaves as Mr Corbyn's chief defender, in the face of attacks from Blairite opponents.  He was also given a role on the party's defence review - but controversy, almost inevitably, followed.  He faced a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs - including Mr Corbyn himself - for suggesting Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister who had suffered from depression, needed "psychiatric help" for suggesting he knew nothing about defence.  An apology eventually came but Mr Livingstone was soon in trouble again, over comments on BBC One's Question Time about how the 7/7 London bombers "gave their lives" to protest against the Iraq war.  He then came under fire from Labour colleagues for describing a donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis from a hedge fund as like "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group".  It later emerged Mr Livingstone himself had accepted £8,000 from a hedge fund, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.  Born in Streatham, South London in 1945, Kenneth Robert Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive before taking up a job as a lab technician working on cancer research in the Royal Marsden Hospital.  In 1971 he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council and that was the start of a long career in politics. Over the next 10 years he served as a local councillor and then on Greater London council before becoming the leader of the GLC in 1981.  After the GLC was abolished he crossed the River Thames to Westminster, winning the seat of Brent East in 1987.  He had a child at the age of 57 with his long term partner and later wife Emma Beal. At the time it was thought to be his first child but in 2008 it emerged that he already had three other children with another two women. Beal and Livingstone went on to have a second child in 2004.  He always had a difficult relationship with his own party. Frequently critical of Neil Kinnock, his battle with the party leadership did not diminish under Tony Blair.  In the run-up to the election of 2000 he failed to secure the Labour mayoral candidacy, losing out to the leadership favourite, Frank Dobson.  Mr Livingstone declared that he would stand as an independent candidate, and so Labour expelled him from the party.  Standing as an independent far from scuppered him, and he won with 58% of the vote.  In 2000, Tony Blair had been critical of his prospects in office claiming he would be a "disaster". However Mr Blair had to eat his words when Livingstone was admitted back into the party ahead of the 2004 mayoral election which saw him re-elected.  "I think I should be big enough to say the prediction I made has not turned out right," Mr Blair said at the time.  Mr Livingstone's flagship mayoral policy was the introduction of the controversial congestion charge in central London, later extended to west London. He unsuccessfully fought the Labour government as it introduced a public-private partnership plan for the London Underground.  He was also involved with London's successful bid for the Olympic Games and in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 2005. Even his opponent Boris Johnson praised him for speaking up for London after 7/7 and the failed attack several weeks later.  Mr Livingstone boasts achievements such as the introduction of the Oyster card for London transport, free use of public transport for under-18s in full-time education and a revival and increased usage of London buses. He also claims to have increased numbers of police on London's streets to a record level.  He faced attack for his links with the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, signing an oil deal with him in 2007 and when he lost the mayoral election in 2008 taking up a position as a consultant to Chavez, advising on urban planning.  Ken Livingstone has always divided opinion. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was the former GLC boss who invented the "loony left" and who brought about the council's abolition by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was "ahead of his time".  The Sun newspaper once described him as "the most odious man in Britain".  But he is still popular with many on the left of the Labour Party, who relished his role as a thorn in Lady Thatcher's side and for speaking his mind about his socialist beliefs, when all about him in the party were abandoning theirs.  It is perhaps, ironic, that just as the Labour Party has started to come back to his way of thinking, he faces being excluded from it.	politics

Lord Levy told BBC Newsnight he believed anti-Semitism existed across the political divide, but it seemed "more prominent" within Labour.  It follows the party's decision to suspend MP Naz Shah from the party over comments about Israel on social media, pending an investigation.  Ms Shah has made a "profound apology" in the Commons for her remarks.  The MP for Bradford West has been widely criticised for Facebook posts she made before she became an MP, in which she suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States.  Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's envoy and chief fundraiser, told the BBC her comments displayed "ignorance", and he was left "scratching his head with despair as to how people like this can enter our parliament with such a lack of knowledge, discretion and sensitivity".  His comments were echoed by cross-bench peer Baroness Neuberger, who claimed Labour's problem of anti-Semitism was "attached to Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader", and added that it was "an issue with the hard left".  Labour has faced claims of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. Earlier this year a Labour Luton councillor was suspended from the party after claiming Hitler was the "greatest man in history".  Jeremy Corbyn has insisted anti-Semitism will not be tolerated but some of his MPs say the party leadership is not doing enough to stamp it out.  Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, Ed Miliband's former chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party "had to do more" to tackle anti-Semitism and MP Lisa Nandy said it had to be more "pro-active".  But Ken Livingstone - the former London Mayor who is a close ally of Mr Corbyn - said Ms Shah's remarks were not anti-Semitic and the suspension was unnecessary.  He told LBC Radio: "What we have at the moment is a lot of people making a big issue about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. In 47 years I have never heard anyone say anything anti-Semitic.  "We expelled a couple of people from the Labour Party early on for saying things that could clearly be interpreted as anti-Semitic.  "This is not that; this is an over-the-top comment about the horrendous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians."  Lord Levy told BBC London Mr Livingstone was "living on another planet" and "well past his sell-by date" if he believed Ms Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic.  Ms Shah was also defended by George Galloway, the former Respect MP who she defeated at the general election, who said in an article that her comments were "half-witted" but not anti-Semitic, and claims to the contrary were "just another stick to beat Corbyn out of office with".  The former Labour MP said Mr Corbyn and his closest ally shadow chancellor John McDonnell were "lifelong campaigners for Palestinians" but he claimed there was an "establishment" conspiracy to falsely paint them as anti-Semitic.  Initially, Mr Corbyn warned Ms Shah about what he described as her "offensive and unacceptable" posts - but he came under pressure to go further by David Cameron, at Prime Minister's Questions.  Ms Shah, who has quit on Tuesday as an aide to Mr McDonnell, then told the Commons: "Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none."  Labour later issued a statement saying Mr Corbyn and Ms Shah had agreed that she was "administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary", pending an investigation.  "She is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed," the statement added.  In a 2014 Facebook post Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline "Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States", with the comment "problem solved".  The post suggested the US has "plenty of land" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to "get their life and their land back".  It added that Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the "transportation cost" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending.  The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes political blogging website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Adolf Hitler.  Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway.  Her selection as a candidate proved controversial, with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee.  A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage.  After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences.  Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.	politics

But, by and large, people who want to use electronic cigarettes will still need to buy them rather than get them on the NHS.  UK doctors can only prescribe e-cigarettes if they have been licensed as a "quit smoking aid" - something that requires strict regulation.  Few manufacturers go down this route and instead sell products to satisfy users' desire for nicotine without the harmful chemicals produced by tobacco.  Sales of e-cigarettes have been rising steadily since the first went on sale in 2007 in the UK.  Since 2012, they have replaced nicotine patches and gum to become the most popular choice of smoking cessation aid in England.  Around one in 20 adults in England uses e-cigarettes, and nearly all of these are ex-smokers or current smokers who are trying to cut down or quit.  The Royal College of Physicians says smokers who use e-cigarettes or prescribed medications - with support from their doctor - are more likely to quit permanently.  And in terms of long-term health hazards, e-cigarettes are at least 95% safer than regular cigarettes - something Public Health England has also said.  But that does not mean they are entirely risk-free.  Prof Simon Capewell, of the Faculty of Public Health, said there were still many unknown factors.  "We don't know enough yet about the long-term effects of vaping on people's health, which is why we need more research.  "The best thing anyone can do if they want to quit smoking is talk to their GP: there's solid evidence that NHS quit-smoking services help people kick the habit for good."  But Prof John Britton, who co-authored the RCP report, says e-cigarettes are extremely positive for public health and should be "encouraged and endorsed".  He said: "The public need to be reassured this is not a new nicotine epidemic in the making. E-cigarettes have very little downside and a lot of potential benefit."  According to Public Health England, smokers should consider using e-cigarettes alongside NHS quit-smoking services.  Around a third of UK smokers try to quit each year, but only one in every six of those succeeds.  New EU laws are due to come into force in May that will set safety and quality standards for all e-cigarettes and refills. Manufacturers will be required to disclose the purity of their products to consumers.  Dr Tim Ballard, from the Royal College of GPs, said: "Moving forward we would be looking for clear evidence that making e-cigarettes available on prescription as part of a wider smoking cessation scheme is a wise use of both scant NHS funds and GP practice resources, before the College could get behind it.  "It is not just the cost of the product that needs taking into account, but the time and resources that are involved in assessing patients, and monitoring their progress over a prolonged period of time.  "We reiterate our calls for NICE to take a leading role in establishing whether making e-cigarettes available on prescription is the best way forward."  A Department of Health spokesperson said: "The best thing a smoker can do for their health is to quit smoking.  "We know that there are now over a million people who have completely replaced smoking with e-cigarettes and that the evidence indicates that they are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco.  "We want to see a wide range of good quality e-cigarettes on the market including licensed products whose safety, quality and effectiveness are independently assured."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36148704	MP Naz Shah suspended from Labour	Labour has suspended MP Naz Shah over comments she made about Israel.  The Bradford West MP has been heavily criticised over the Facebook posts, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.  In a Commons statement she offered a "profound apology" for the posts, which were made before she became an MP.  Earlier party leader Jeremy Corbyn warned her about the "offensive and unacceptable" posts and David Cameron called for her suspension.  Labour said: "Jeremy Corbyn and Naz Shah have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary.  "Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed."  Apologising in the Commons, Ms Shah, who had already quit as an unpaid aide to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said: "Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relationships between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none."  The announcement of her suspension came after pressure mounted on the MP, with Mr Cameron saying during Prime Minister's Questions it was "quite extraordinary" that Labour had not withdrawn the whip from her over what he suggested were "racist" comments.  Saying sorry three times didn't prevent Naz Shah's suspension.  Number 10 are taking credit - but one shadow cabinet member, Lisa Nandy, had already called for her suspension and I'm told other Labour figures had approached party officials privately to call for the same thing.  Ten days ago Labour's general secretary had reassured MPs those accused of anti-Semitism would be expelled or suspended.  Insiders say that once the Labour leader had decided to hand the matter to party officials, suspension - and an investigation - became inevitable.  Most Labour MPs recognise few members hold anti-Semitic views but that some high-profile cases have been toxic, and have been pressing their leadership to be more proactive in uncovering and rooting out unacceptable views.  And some on the party's right are keen to force a leader who has opposed "witch hunts" of party members to use disciplinary procedures to erect, however reluctantly, some walls to Labour's broad church - and to make clear that the views of some recent members and supporters aren't welcome.  Minutes before PMQs, Mr Corbyn issued a statement, saying: "These are historic social media posts made before she was a member of parliament. Naz has issued a fulsome apology.  "She does not hold these views and accepts she was completely wrong to have made these posts. The Labour Party is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism."  Labour MP Lisa Nandy had called for Ms Shah's suspension, while another Labour MP, Kate Hoey, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she should resign "right away" from the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which is carrying out an inquiry into anti-Semitism.  Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway.  Her selection as a candidate proved controversial with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee.  A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage.  After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences.  Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.  In a Facebook post in 2014, Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline "Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States", with the comment "problem solved".  The post suggested the US has "plenty of land" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to "get their life and their land back".  It added Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the "transportation cost" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending.  Ms Shah added a note suggesting the plan might "save them some pocket money".  The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Hitler.  In a statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.  "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."  She set out a more detailed apology in an article for Jewish News.  "The language I used was wrong," she wrote.  "It is hurtful. What's important is the impact these posts have had on other people. I understand that referring to Israel and Hitler as I did is deeply offensive to Jewish people for which I apologise."  The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36151222	Junior doctors: Patients' views on the strike	While the placards and politics of the junior doctors' strike have dominated the news, what matters more for patients is the care they receive.  The BBC has spoken to patients and two first-time fathers about how the strike affected care in England's hospitals.  The 35-year-old and his partner Catalina became parents to baby Ruan at 13:00 BST on Tuesday - while the strike was in progress.  Catalina, 33, had a caesarean section at St Thomas' Hospital in central London after doctors had tried to induce the birth.  Liam said: "I couldn't have been happier because there were more consultants on board. Because there were so many of them, decisions were being made straight away. It was brilliant.  "After they made the decision to do a C-section, she was in surgery within 10 minutes.  "We got informed the day before there was going to be a strike and that lots of consultants were on call. For my partner's C-section, there were three consultants in surgery - that's unheard of.  "I fully support the junior doctors. But in my opinion the hospital was actually running a bit better. Everything was straight forward. It's one of the main hospitals in the country so they would have to have everything running like clockwork."  Retired nurse Maureen Gaunt, 68, was bitten by a dog she was walking on Tuesday and was told to go to A&E at Dewsbury and District Hospital after attending her local GP surgery.  She said: "The bite was a bit of an accident - I was walking a dog and had him on a lead, but he's not very good with other dogs and when he saw one, he was yapping and then my leg got in the way. It was quite a nasty bite though.  "I went to my GP surgery but they sent me straight to A&E. My first thought was that it would be chaos when I got there, but it was so quiet it was unbelievable.  "The care was excellent. I probably waited 20 minutes to see the nurse practitioner and he was very good. He sent me for an X-ray and arranged for a consultant to take a look at it. I was there for a couple of hours and didn't notice any difference after the strike finished. It was extremely quiet and the nurses said it had been quiet all day.  "I was very pleasantly surprised. You wouldn't have known anything was going on.  "I can understand where the doctors are coming from - I just feel disappointed they felt they had to strike. I felt, as a nurse, you couldn't strike because of the patients. But I fully support them in what they're aiming to do."  His first child was due on 14 May - but due to his wife Natalie having developed gestational diabetes, doctors decided to induce labour.  She was taken into hospital on Thursday. When the baby still hadn't arrived by Sunday, the couple opted for a procedure to bring on contractions so the baby would be born the following day - rather than the next day when the strike would be in progress.  "We had that fear in our heads," he said. "They promised the care would be fine, but as an individual you have to make that call. We decided to mitigate the risk. And also, my wife was absolutely shattered."  Their son was born at 11:00 BST on Monday, with mother and baby remaining in hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday.  "We had wonderful care throughout," said Michael. "It was amazing and the midwives were great. My wife said to me she hadn't noticed anything different. They are all professionals and did a good job in the circumstances."  He added that he "supports the walkout, without a doubt".  Catherine had to attend A&E at St Thomas' Hospital on Tuesday for what she described as an "urgent but fairly minor problem".  "I was told my problem would normally be dealt with by a junior doctor but today I saw a consultant instead," she said.  "No extra delays. There's lots of consultants around and extra nurses. All seems to be running smoothly, contrary to what [Health Secretary Jeremy] Hunt and co were implying."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36154722	Junior doctors' row: Both sides ready to fight on	Ministers and doctors have both vowed to fight on as the first all-out doctor strikes in the history of the NHS ended in England without any major problems.  The last two days have seen junior doctors walk out of routine and emergency care in protest against the imposition of new working conditions.  NHS bosses said hospitals had coped "admirably" during the stoppages.  But there looks to be no end in sight to the dispute with doctors' leaders not ruling out more strikes.  Sources at the British Medical Association said they would now spend the coming days and weeks considering their next options.  But they were adamant this would not be the end of the protest against the imposition of a new contract.  Options on the table include everything from a series of rolling strikes to refusing to do vital paperwork. Meanwhile, two legal challenges are still working their way through the courts.  Some doctors have even talked about encouraging mass resignations from the health service.  A source said: "The government is adamant it won't give in, but so are we. Doctors are not ready to back down."  But government sources responded by saying both the Department of Health and Number 10 had made it clear any escalation in strike action would not stop imposition of the contract from this summer.  "The government is confident in its position and we've made that clear to the BMA."  Wednesday's stoppage ended at 17:00 BST, bringing to an end two days of industrial action which saw 78% of doctors who were expected to work not turning up.  But hospitals told the BBC services had run smoothly during the stoppages - some even said it had been quieter than expected - with consultants and nurses covering emergency care.  It meant no NHS trust had to trigger the emergency protocols which allowed them to call for junior doctors to return to work if patients were at risk.  NHS England's Anne Rainsberry said this was down to careful planning in the lead up to the strike - more than 100,000 routine appointments and nearly 13,000 operations were postponed to allow staff to be redeployed.  "We're not going to pretend the last two days have been easy, but the NHS has remained open to business for patients. The health service has coped admirably."  Patients who ended up in hospital reported they had received good quality care.  Liam Walker, 35, from London, said his partner had been well cared for while in labour.  "There are three consultants instead of three juniors," he said. "We've had fantastic treatment."  Retired health visitor Maureen Gaunt, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, went to accident and emergency for a dog bite.  "The staff were very welcoming," she said. "I waited no longer than 20 minutes. Even the staff said it was quiet."  But patients who have seen their treatment delayed have spoken about the problems it has caused.  Senior nurse Wendy Ginsing's daughter Hannah, 21, has been waiting for treatment for a brain tumour since before Christmas. She was due to be admitted on Tuesday, but that was postponed.  "Understandably Hannah is devastated and very annoyed about this," her mother said.  But Ms Ginsing said she still supported the junior doctors' action, adding: "I have seen how dangerous sleep disruption in doctors can be."  There are a variety of factors. The NHS has had five weeks to prepare for these strikes and by cancelling routine appointments and operations in advanced it was able to free up consultants and nurses to work in emergency care.  Consultants have been largely supportive of their junior colleagues - in some cases even encouraging them to go out - and so have been only too willing to make sure services run smoothly.  The increased presence of senior doctors may have actually speed up processes. For example, Milton Keynes Hospital said having more consultants in A&E enabled quicker decisions to be made about what treatments patients needed.  The public also seem to have heeded warnings to stay away unless absolutely necessary. But that doesn't mean hospitals have got away with it. The number of delayed routine treatments - including cancer care - is piling up, while some hospitals fear there could be a spike in demand in the coming days.  Barry Edwards, who has had open heart surgery and had a follow-up appointment and scan postponed, was more critical.  "I am left in a situation of not knowing if my medication is appropriate, if I am on the mend and recovering as I should," he said.  Mr Edwards said he did not support the strike, adding junior doctors were no longer held in great esteem.  Meanwhile, patient groups have warned the accumulation of postponed treatments - nearly 40,000 operations have now been delayed during the whole dispute - is taking its toll and causing harm. Alongside routine treatments, there have been reports of cancer patients facing delays.  The dispute is over a new contract that the government announced in February would be imposed from the summer. This followed the breakdown of talks between the two sides in January.  The contract makes it cheaper to rota doctors on at weekends - something ministers say is needed to improve care on a Saturday and Sunday.  The BMA has argued it is unfair and the NHS needs extra investment to pay for seven-day services.  Before this week's strikes, there had been four walkouts but all involved emergency care being maintained by junior doctors.	health

Mark Pritchard, who also wants rubber linings on car doors to allow them to be closed quietly, says rising noise levels are hitting quality of life.  He also saw no need for emergency services' sirens after midnight.  "The right to respite from constant noise needs to be a feature of government policy," he told MPs.  During a parliamentary debate, which the Conservative MP for Wrekin said was a first in Commons history, Mr Pritchard said there had been a lot of discussion about making cities greener and smarter, but little thought given to making them quieter.  He noted there were no cities in his Shropshire constituency, or in the entire county, and that Ludlow had designated itself a "slow town".  He cited research suggesting unremitting noise pollution helped cause sleep deprivation and high blood pressure and, in extreme cases, was a contributory factor in hearing loss and cardiovascular disease.  "Loud cities do have an impact on the quality of life of millions of people," he said. "They also have an impact on our health."  Among the mitigating measures that should be encouraged, he said, were tree planting, the use of "noise buffers" in landscaping, more car-free areas, quieter pavements and road surfaces, the proper fitting of manhole covers and "polite notices" about loud conversations and mobile ring tones on public transport.  Rubber lining should become mandatory in car doors in the future as "metal on metal makes noise".  On emergency services, he said: "Some of the sirens are so ear-piercing. The ambulances do seem to be, anecdotally, far louder than the police. Do they need to be used after midnight when the blue lights can be seen?"  He also hit out at the London Duck tours which he said were causing "real disruption" to the lives of residents  He said: "The right to respite from constant noise needs to be a feature of government policy, part of its strategy, not a by-product of another government policy.	politics

The stoppage lasts from 08:00 BST until 17:00 BST with consultants and nurses staffing A&E and intensive care.  This follows Tuesday's stoppage which many hospitals said they coped well with after being quieter than expected.  Similar reports have emerged on Wednesday with patients reporting they have received quick and efficient care.  Liam Walker, 35, from London, said his partner had been well cared for while in labour.  "There are three consultants instead of three juniors," he said. "We've had fantastic treatment."  Retired health visitor Maureen Gaunt, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, went to accident and emergency for a dog bite.  "The staff were very welcoming," she said. "I waited no longer than 20 minutes.

Mr Edwards said he did not support the strike, adding junior doctors were no longer held in great esteem.  This week's strikes are the first time doctors have stopped providing emergency care in the history of the NHS.  Emergency protocols have been agreed to allow hospitals to call for junior doctors to return to work if patients are at risk. But they have not been used by any NHS trust yet.  NHS England's Anne Rainsberry said that was down to the hard work of staff that were on duty - consultants and nurses were redeployed to emergency services following the cancellation of more than 100,000 routine appointments and nearly 13,000 non-emergency operations.  "This is an unprecedented situation and staff across the NHS have made Herculean efforts to ensure continued safe services for patients."  A dedicated webpage has been set up on NHS Choices to provide information about the strike.  On Tuesday 78% of doctors expected at work did not turn up. But many hospitals said contingency plans had worked well.  Dr Cliff Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said demand at his hospital trust - Taunton and Somerset - had been quieter than normal and he was "absolutely" sure lives had not been put at risk because of the cover provided by other doctors and nurses.  Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust in Surrey said services had run "smoothly", while Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had not seen "undue pressure", although it did "anticipate a surge in demand" once the strikes were over.  But patient groups have warned the accumulation of postponed treatments - nearly 40,000 operations have now been delayed during the whole dispute - is taking its toll and causing harm. Alongside routine treatments, there have been reports of cancer patients facing delays.  The dispute is over a new contract that the government announced in February would be imposed from the summer.

He said he was the "only party leader who has got a chance of winning seats in all four of them".  The party is also defending 200 seats on English local authorities and standing in police and crime commissioner elections.  UKIP has been hit by internal rows over candidate selection.  But Mr Farage insisted that had nothing to do with him, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  He said he wanted to use the 5 May elections as a springboard for UKIP's campaign to get Britain out of the EU in 23 June's referendum - but denied the party was a "single issue" campaign.  "We have moved way beyond people voting UKIP as a protest, to send a message, and what we are seeing is a very strong consolidation of the UKIP vote.  "People now want to vote UKIP in every possible form of election. We have made some big advances in councils over the course of the last couple of years.  "And I do anticipate more of that on 5 May, but for me the big goal on 5 May is to win representation in the London Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Irish Assembly.  "I think I am the only party leader who has got a chance of winning seats in all four of them."  The UKIP leader has been touring the country to drum up support for UKIP's candidates, including six visits to Northern Ireland, where UKIP hopes to gain its first Stormont seat.  The party has never had any members of the Scottish Parliament either, although it gained its first MEP in Scotland in 2014. It has had London Assembly members in the past but does not currently have any.  Polls suggest the party is on course to gain its first seats on the Welsh assembly, where its candidates include former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless.  Some UKIP activists claim the pair were imposed on Wales by party HQ in London at the expense of local contenders.  The party's leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, said he would "probably" not have selected Mr Hamilton, whose career as a Conservative MP was cut short by "cash-for-questions" allegations.  But Mr Farage said Mr Reckless and Mr Hamilton had been selected by UKIP members in Wales, adding: "That's party democracy."  He also said he had nothing to do with the decision to suspend prominent UKIP figure Suzanne Evans, seen as a potential leadership rival to him, for six months over allegations of bringing the party into disrepute.  But he declined to reinstate Ms Evans, who wanted to be a UKIP candidate in London, adding: "I don't think she behaved terribly well."  Mr Farage has recently spoken about his frustrations with the "volunteer" National Executive Committee that runs UKIP, suggesting the party needs a "professional management board".  He hinted an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil that he planned a major shake-up of the party after the EU referendum, possibly remodelling it along the lines of Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement, in Italy, which uses online polling to choose candidates and decide policy.  "I think the model where we send money and get a membership card that we keep in our wallet is just old hat," he said on the BBC's This Week.  He said he wanted a "completely different approach to politics and I think that's where UKIP needs to go".	politics

Local councillors and some MPs say mayors for three rural parts of England will add an expensive and unwanted extra tier of government.  Councils could reject the idea and opt out of new authorities in Lincolnshire, the west of England and East Anglia, North Somerset MP Liam Fox said.  The government says it wants to help the local economy and devolve power.  Some Conservative councillors in the rural areas intend to try to block the policy, which will not be imposed on unwilling areas.  In his Budget in March, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for elected mayors in the three areas.  Local authorities will vote on whether or not to accept detailed proposals by the end of June.  North West Norfolk MP Sir Henry Bellingham, said people would feel no affinity to a new authority and elections for a new mayor would attract a "pathetic" turnout.  He told the Today programme on Radio 4: "Now I don't want a regional leader coming along and saying look 'Henry you've been a bad boy, I gather you don't want this incinerator, you don't want these houses, well actually the region do want it and I'd like you to have it'.  "That is going to put MPs in a very difficult position and change their constitutional position."  While he supported the idea of devolution, he said plans for a new mayor should be put on hold.  A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said it was making "huge progress" in making local areas more powerful by devolving power from Whitehall.  A source close to the chancellor said: "The devolution revolution taking place across the country has unstoppable momentum behind it."  Six new authorities, which will have elected mayors, have been established in mainly urban areas, with another expected this summer.  Conservative sceptics argue the plans will not work in rural areas.  Passing extra powers to large authorities with accountable, high-profile mayors is one of the Mr Osborne's central aims.  Privately, some Conservatives have compared it to the government's attempt to turn all English schools into academies, accusing it of forcing the plan on reluctant councils.  One said councils had been "bribed and bullied" in a bid to make them accept the idea.  But a DCLG spokesman said: "The government is making huge progress towards rebalancing the economy and empowering local areas through the devolution of powers and resources away from Whitehall to local people.  "Ministers have been repeatedly clear that devolution is a genuinely bottom-up process - all proposals are agreed by local leaders, and the government will not impose an arrangement on any area."  Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood near Bristol, said he supported the idea, and a new West of England mayor would create a "powerhouse in the south".  Directly-elected mayors would be put in place, he said, even if some authorities chose not to take part. He said: "If one council decides they don't want to do a deal, the other three will go ahead with the same pot of money given to those three councils."  Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, who has secured a House of Commons debate on the topic, said politicians would not give the government a "blank cheque" to sign up for more local government with a weak mayor.  He said: "It's not something when you're talking of spending hundreds of millions of pounds over the next 30 years that any responsible elected politician accountable to their electorate can sign up to."  The leader of the Conservative group on Norfolk County Council, Cliff Jordan said he thought the council would reject the policy.  The Labour leader of the Council George Nobbs supports the idea of devolution but also opposes the policy in its current form.  Cambridgeshire County Council, which has a Conservative leader, has already voted to oppose the plan as it stands.  The Local Government Association wants local areas to be able to accept new powers and extra funding offered by the Treasury without having elected mayors.  A spokesman said: "People should be free to choose the appropriate model of robust governance for their community."	politics

MPs said more cities should get the enhanced powers being granted to London, Leeds, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton.  The powers allow cities to charge high-polluting vehicles to discourage them from entering the city centre.  The committee said tackling air quality was a priority.  The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last year outlined the plans to introduce five clean air zones by 2020, after a Supreme Court ruling ordered it to comply with European Union law limits on nitrogen dioxide in the air. These five are in addition to the existing one in the capital.  The proposed clean air zones will only affect older - mainly diesel - buses, lorries, coaches and taxis, but will not apply to private cars.  Separately, London's mayor has announced that an "ultra low emission zone" being introduced in the centre of the capital from 2020 will apply to all vehicles, including private cars.  All six cities currently granted the enhanced powers were found to have the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide.  The government said the zones would both reduce pollution in city centres and encourage the replacement of older vehicles with higher emissions.  The report from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said emissions had been declining significantly but there were 40-50,000 early deaths each year in the UK because of cardiac, respiratory and other diseases linked to air pollution.  Committee chairman Neil Parish, the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, said: "Only five cities... will have new powers to charge polluting vehicles to enter new clean air zones.  "Councils in the dozens of other English cities currently exceeding EU pollution limits must also be given the option of using such powers if their communities support action."  The current plans for the zones, added the report, imposed a "one size fits all" model.  It said local authorities must be given "greater flexibility in order that they can tailor measures to best meet their local circumstances.  "For example, cities may find it more effective to limit vehicle access at certain times of day or to target specific bus routes rather than adopt blanket access proposals."  The Local Government Association said councils wanted powers to be able to enforce traffic violations, like illegal U-turns and box junction offences, in the same way London councils can, to combat congestion hot spots.  It also wants more promotion of cycling, walking and public transport, and is calling on the government to fully fund the concessionary fares scheme and incentivise a move away from polluting diesel vehicles to non-diesel transport.  This report joins a growing body of challenge to government air pollution policy.  People are outraged by car firms cheating emissions tests. Parents are fed up of hearing their children are breathing harmful air. Campaigners are angry that ministers have tried to water down laws designed to protect public health.  And diesel drivers are annoyed at being blamed for running cars that government encouraged them to buy in the first place.  It took 400 years to clean up the capital's air from coal smoke, according to a new book - London Fog - by Christine Corton.  The government is being pressed to act faster to solve nitrogen pollution in all the UK's cities.  Air pollution has caught public attention by the scandal of car makers cheating emissions tests - and by successful court cases brought against the government under European law by the group ClientEarth.  Its spokesman Alan Andrews said a decision was due in weeks on further legal action on the adequacy of the government's plan to solve the problem.  He welcomed the MPs' report but told BBC News there was a further problem: "I can't understand why the MPs are willing to get even tougher on drivers whilst merely advising farmers how to reduce the ammonia coming off their manure heaps.  "The pollution from farms drifts across cities and harms people's health - there's been barely any reduction in it for a decade, so it's incredible that the farm lobby has managed to wriggle out of legislation."  The MPs' report says a cross-government approach is needed and calls for more action from the inter-departmental ministerial Clean Growth Group chaired by Oliver Letwin. The MPs say this group has no timetable, no minutes and needs to be less secretive.  A Defra spokesman said: "Tackling air quality is a priority for this government and our plans set out how we will achieve this through continued investment in clean technologies and by encouraging the uptake of low emission vehicles.  "Cities already have powers to introduce Clean Air Zones, and other air quality schemes, and our plans will require five cities to implement these zones...  "Later this year we will also consult on a clean air zone framework that will give local authorities the flexibility to make decisions about their own areas while ensuring a co-ordinated approach across the UK."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36146561	Trade Union Bill: E-voting review among expected changes	A review of whether to allow electronic voting in strike ballots is expected to be part of further changes to the government's Trade Union Bill.  Ministers are also expected to delay controversial changes to unions' political funds.  The bill, which has faced fierce criticism from unions and the Labour Party, is returning before MPs after a series of defeats in the Lords.  Downing Street said it was trying to "get the balance right".  Last week the government backed down over plans to end the right of workers to pay union subscriptions by deducting them from their wages.  The e-voting review was one of the amendments made by the House of Lords when it defeated the government in votes on the bill last month.  As part of the government's response to that defeat, changes are also expected to reforms planned for unions' political levies, according to BBC political correspondent Carole Walker.  Ministers want to require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party.  If an opt-in is introduced, Labour believes three million fewer members of the biggest unions would agree to pay into them, costing it £6m.  The government is expected to press ahead with the reform but to give unions 12 months, rather than three months, to introduce it.  Peers said the changes should apply to new members only.  David Cameron's spokeswoman said: "The bill is going through the usual parliamentary process in the House where members of Parliament have the opportunity to voice views and raise concerns and the government can look at those and respond appropriately."  The TUC has called the bill "unnecessary, anti-democratic and unfair".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36146116	Government defeated again in Lords over child refugees	The government has been defeated again in the House of Lords over calls to take in child refugees from Europe.  A new amendment to the Immigration Bill from Labour's Lord Dubs was backed by 279 votes to 172.  It would force ministers to arrange the relocation of children who have made it to Europe into the UK, with the total number to be decided by the government.  The government has warned against encouraging people to place children in the hands of traffickers.  It announced last week it would take in as many as 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  But campaigners, including charity Save the Children, are calling for unaccompanied children who have already made it into Europe to be allowed into the UK.  On Monday night, MPs rejected Lord Dubs' attempt to force the government to admit 3,000 children from Europe.  His revised amendment - which was backed by the Lords - did not include the 3,000 target, instead requiring the government to consult with local authorities to come up with a total.  Labour peer Lord Dubs arrived in the UK in 1939 as a six-year-old refugee fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.  He was one of 669 children who escaped the Holocaust on trains from Prague organised by British stockbroker Sir Nicholas Winton.  After a 48-hour journey, the young Alf Dubs was met by his father, who had fled to England the day the Nazis entered Czechoslovakia, at Liverpool Street station in London.  In the Lords debate, Home Office minister Earl Howe said the issue of child refugees was "highly emotive" and that the UK had a "moral duty to help those in need".  He said the government was "already fulfilling that duty", adding that "physically transporting unaccompanied children from one part of the EU to another is not the best or most effective way to fulfil our duty".  Lord Dubs said he welcomed government support for refugees, but added: "When all is said and done, the government will still leave thousands of children in Europe.  "Children who are vulnerable, children who are in an unhappy situation, children who are in danger possibly even to their lives and certainly to their wellbeing."  He said he was "astonished" at the support for his amendment.  Speaking before the vote, the prime minister's spokeswoman said the government wanted to protect vulnerable people but not "fuel a system that is incentivising people to be exploited by trafficking gangs and make perilous journeys".  The government suffered further defeats on the Immigration Bill over the detention of pregnant women in immigration custody and holding people in detention for more than 28 days.  It will now decide whether to try to overturn the latest defeats when the bill returns to the Commons.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36142252	Junior doctors' strike: Hospitals 'coped well'	Hospitals in England have coped well with the all-out strike by junior doctors - the first in the history of the NHS - health bosses are reporting.  Junior doctors walked out at 08:00 BST on Tuesday, returning at 17:00 BST. A second day of strike action is due to begin at 08:00 BST on Wednesday.  A number of hospitals told the BBC services had run smoothly - with some saying they were quieter than normal.  But there are fears demand could surge once the strikes are over.  Meanwhile, figures released by NHS England showed 78% of junior doctors due in work did not turn up.  The British Medical Association membership covers about 80% of junior doctors, although non-members can still strike.  In preparation for the stoppage, hospitals cancelled more than 100,000 routine appointments and nearly 13,000 non-emergency operations.  This has allowed them to redeploy consultants, middle-grade doctors and nurses into emergency services, such as accident and emergency, maternity and intensive care units.  GPs were also asked to keep more appointments than normal free for last-minute urgent calls, and NHS 111 staffing has been boosted to allow it to deal with extra calls.  NHS England had likened it to planning a "military" operation.  The planning seems to have worked, with no hospital triggering an emergency escalation procedure that would allow them, via the NHS England and the BMA, to call striking junior doctors back into work if they felt they could not cope.  Ipswich Hospital chief executive Nick Hulme said his trust had been coping well - and more doctors than expected had come into work, 23 out of 122, suggesting an all-out strike had been a "step too far" for some.  But he said both sides needed to come back together to resolve the dispute "quickly", saying it was getting "really difficult" for the NHS to cope with the backlog of postponed operations.  Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust reported everything was "running smoothly" during the final hours of the walkout, while Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had not seen "undue pressure", although it did "anticipate a surge in demand" once the strikes were over.  On Tuesday afternoon, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust in Surrey said: "Our services are not under undue pressure so far. Contingency plans are going smoothly."  Dr Cliff Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said demand at his hospital trust - Taunton and Somerset - had been quieter than normal and he was "absolutely" sure lives had not been put at risk because of the cover provided by other doctors and nurses.  Earlier, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the walkout was a "very, very bleak day" for the NHS, but once again stressed the government would not back down, saying no union had the right to stop a government trying to act on a manifesto promise.  Wednesday's walkout also lasts from 08:00 BST to 17:00 BST.  The dispute is over a new contract that the government announced in February would be imposed from the summer. This followed the breakdown of talks between the two sides in January.  The contract makes it cheaper to rota doctors on at weekends - something ministers say is needed to improve care on a Saturday and Sunday.  The BMA has argued it is unfair and the NHS needs extra investment to pay for seven-day services.  Before this week's strikes, there had been four walkouts but all involved emergency care being covered by junior doctors.	health

Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment "problem solved".  It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP.  The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was "appalling".  The graphic said relocating Israel would be a "solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", and that it would allow Palestinians to "get their life and their land back".  In a statement, Ms Shah said: "This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused."  Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell.  In a second statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.  "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."  She said she would be expanding her "existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism".  The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36134103	Junior doctors' strike: All-out stoppage 'a bleak day'	The first all-out doctors' strike in the NHS's history is a "bleak day", ministers say, but hospitals seem to be coping well during Tuesday's walkout.  Junior doctors walked out of routine and emergency care at 08:00 BST.  The stoppage affects A&E, maternity and intensive care for the first time.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt expressed disappointment that the stoppage was taking place, but again said the government would not back down and halt the imposition of the new contract.  The walkout ends at 17:00 BST with further all-out action due to take place on Wednesday, between the same hours, in the protest against the imposition of the new contract from the summer.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hunt described it as a "very, very bleak day" for the NHS, but said no union had the right to stop a government trying to act on a manifesto promise.  "The reason this has happened is because the government has been unable to negotiate sensibly and reasonably with the BMA."  Before the strike, government sources had indicated that they could not give in because the row had become political, with the BMA trying to topple the government, and other unions watching the dispute "like hawks". The BMA described this as ridiculous.  During the stoppage, hospitals can request that junior doctors return to work if needed, but as yet, no NHS trust has raised the alarm.  There have been reports that hospitals may be quieter than normal with patients heeding warnings to stay away unless absolutely necessary.  NHS England said the situation was being monitored carefully, but "military level" contingency planning had ensured hospitals were as well prepared as they could be.  NHS England's Anne Rainsberry said: "Clearly industrial action of this type can put significant pressure on the NHS. We have been working with all hospitals to make sure they have plans in place to provide urgent and emergency care."  She said those plans were "robust" and hospitals were "confident" they could cope, but the situation would be kept under review.  There are more than 50,000 junior doctors in the NHS in England, representing about a third of the medical workforce.  Ipswich Hospital chief executive Nick Hulme said his trust had been coping well - and more doctors than expected had come into work, 23 out of 122, suggesting an all-out strike had been a "step too far" for some.  But he said both sides needed to come back together to resolve the dispute "quickly", saying it was getting "really difficult" for the NHS to cope with the backlog of postponed operations.  A new poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC showed the majority of the public still backed junior doctors, although support was not as high after it became an all-out stoppage.  Asked whether they supported junior doctors striking while not providing emergency cover, 57% said they did and 26% said they were opposed.  The last time the public was asked was ahead of the 48-hour walkout in March, when emergency cover was maintained. Then, 65% supported junior doctors.  The poll of more than 800 adults in England also found a growing number of people blaming both sides for the impasse. Some 35% said the government and junior doctors were at fault. The majority - 54% - still blamed the government.  The dispute is about working hours and pay, but a key sticking point is about payments for working on Saturdays.  Talks between the government and British Medical Association (BMA) broke down in January, prompting the government to announce in February that it would be imposing its contract in the summer.  The strike comes after last-minute pleas from medical leaders, patient groups and opposition MPs for both sides to get back round the negotiating table.  National Voices, a coalition of patient groups and charities, even offered to host talks. Chief executive Jeremy Taylor said: "Patients and the public are caught in the middle - and the harm is being felt by patients and their families."  BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said if the government had scrapped his plan to impose the contract, the union would not have taken this action.  "No doctor wants to take any action. They want to be in work, treating patients, but by refusing to get back around the negotiating table the government has left them with no choice but to take short-term action to protect patient care in the long term."

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36127641	Devastated, disappointed and in pain	Patients who have had appointments cancelled the week of the all-out junior doctors' strike have told the BBC why they support or oppose the walkouts.  The latest strike on Tuesday and Wednesday will affect emergency care for the first time.  More than 100,000 outpatient appointments and planned operations are set to be delayed because of the action, NHS England says, while essential care is being provided by consultants and other senior staff during the strike.  My beautiful and previously vibrant 21-year-old daughter has a tumour in the pituitary gland in her brain.  This has caused her to develop Cushing's disease, which has had devastating effects on her body - she is exhausted, her skin is breaking down and scarring, her hair is falling out, her muscles are weak and she is at risk of diabetes and osteoporosis.  She was diagnosed in early November and originally promised surgery to remove the tumour before Christmas but had to wait, which was very frustrating as her health continued to deteriorate and the increasing number of scars all over her body will be with her for life.  She was finally given a planned date for surgery last month and was due to be admitted to King's College Hospital [on Tuesday].  Despite reassurances that everything would go ahead, as her surgery is now urgent because the tumour has gone into overdrive, she has now been called to say that this is cancelled and they have no idea about when this will be rebooked.  Understandably, Hannah is devastated and very annoyed about this.  We all support the fight of the junior doctors to have safe working patterns and cannot understand why [Health secretary] Jeremy Hunt will not realise that you cannot work 12 days in a row and still make sensible life-and-death decisions.  I am an advanced nurse practitioner, and, over my 38 years in nursing, I have seen how dangerous sleep deprivation in doctors can be.  Following open heart surgery, I was due to have a further follow-up appointment and scan with my consultant on Wednesday.  This has now been rearranged.  I am left in a situation of not knowing if my medication is appropriate, if I am on the mend and recovering as I should.  I am unsure if I can return to work as normal, and I cannot go on holiday abroad until allowed to do so.  Whilst I am totally supportive of the hospital and staff who have "repaired" me, and forever grateful, I do not support the strike and believe the BMA [British Medical Association] are amateurish in their dealing with the government.  They do not understand that in negotiations neither side gets what it wants.  They are losing public support and, indeed, for me, have lost the fight.  It is all about wages and nothing else.  Junior doctors are no longer held in great esteem, just another group whinging about their lot.  I would support them more if they did not strike and pursued their cause in a different way - but, for me, they have blown it.  Find out the latest on the all-out strike  What patients need to know  Will services actually be safer during the walkouts?  I was due to have a spinal block procedure on Thursday.  I have been waiting months for it and am in pain all the time.  The procedure was meant to help ease the pain.  So, when I received the letter saying it was postponed, it almost reduced me to tears.  I had been counting down the days ahead of it, and now I have no idea when I will get it.  It said in the letter that it was "due to unforeseen circumstances" and they will contact me again.  I support the junior doctors' right to strike, but it's just disappointing that I won't have this done now.  Last time I had a pre-op for prostate, the junior doctors went on strike.  I saw men crying because their operations were being cancelled.  This time, they didn't tell me it had been cancelled because of the strikes - but I am putting two and two together.  Junior doctors do not seem to care about what they are doing to the NHS.  They are doing a lot of damage.  Time is important for me.  I am on hormone treatment, so my cancer should be kept steady.  She would never have tolerated this.  You don't walk out of the NHS.  We feel they do not particularly care.  It is more about politics than health.  It is OK to have a go at Jeremy Hunt, but they have to put the patients first.  There have to be alternatives to going on strike.	health

The trial at 24 doctors' practices found people vaccinated before lunch produced the most defensive antibodies.  The University of Birmingham team suggested immunising people in tune with the body's natural rhythm could be a cheap way to save lives.  Experts said the study may mark the dawn of making use of "the body clock in the clinic".  Our internal clock alters our alertness, mood, physical strength and even the risk of a heart attack in a daily rhythm.  And our immune system also waxes and wanes through the day.  Find out what is happening in your body right now  The trial looked at 276 healthy people, aged over 65, getting the flu jab before the 2011, 2012 and 2013 flu seasons.  They were vaccinated either in a morning session (09:00 to 11:00) or an afternoon appointment (13:00 to 17:00).  One month later, patients vaccinated in the morning had produced significantly more antibodies against two of the three flu strains in the jab.  Similar antibody levels were produced for the third strain, the results in the journal Vaccine showed.  Dr Anna Phillips, one of the researchers from the University of Birmingham, said the results were meaningful and doctors should "definitely" think about performing flu jabs in the morning.  She told the BBC News website: "A lot of surgeries just try and fit in vaccination anyway so it's not going to risk any patient, it's not going to cost anything and even if we're wrong you've nothing to lose by doing this.  "I think it's fantastic, the idea of an intervention this easy to do and free is unheard of in terms of trying to change NHS practice."  It is not clear exactly what the critical difference between the morning and afternoon immune system is.  Levels of immune messengers called cytokines, the stress hormone cortisol and sex hormones - all of which affect the immune system - fluctuate in a daily rhythm.  And individual white blood cells also have their own internal clocks that alter their activity too.  Andrew Loudon and David Ray, a pair of body clock professors at the University of Manchester, told the BBC News website: "This may be the dawn of the body clock in the clinic.  "This is a most interesting study, and is among the first to show how the body clock can be used to make healthcare interventions more effective.  "There have been major advances in understanding how the body clock can regulate immunity in laboratory animals, but very little of that exciting science has led to changes in healthcare.  "This study shows that a simple intervention, giving the same vaccine at a different time of day, can result in a major gain in effectiveness."  However, other vaccines stimulate the immune system in different ways so it is too simple to conclude that all immunisation should take place before lunch.  There have been some suggestions that hepatitis B vaccination may be more effective in the afternoon.  But the concept of timing medicine to the body clock - the field of chronotherapy - is powerful and is also showing promise in treating cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36128646	Bed bugs repulsed by certain colours	Bed bugs appear to have a strong preference for particular colours - a quirk that could be used against the troublesome pests, say scientists.  According to the work in the Journal of Medical Entomology, the blood-sucking insects love black and red but hate yellow and green.  This information could help make better traps to lure and catch the bugs.  But it is too soon to say if yellow sheets can stop them nesting in your bed, say the US researchers.  Bed bugs are tiny and they like to live close to their next meal - your blood. They can hide in the seam of your mattress or a joint in your bed frame. They tend to prefer fabric and wood over plastic and metal.  But Dr Corraine McNeill and colleagues wanted to find out if colours affected where bed bugs might dwell.  They carried out a series of experiments in their lab, placing bed bugs in dishes with different colour shelters made out of card.  Rather than taking cover at random, the bugs appeared to select the shelters according to their colour, showing a preference for black and red.  Dr McNeill said: "We originally thought the bed bugs might prefer red because blood is red and that's what they feed on.  "However, after doing the study, the main reason we think they preferred red colours is because bed bug themselves appear red, so they go to these harborages because they want to be with other bed bugs."  The bugs appeared to dislike yellow and green shelters, possibly because these bright colours remind them of brightly lit areas that are less safe to hide in, say the researchers.  Past studies have found these two colours are unattractive to other blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes and sandflies.  Dr McNeill said: "I always joke with people, 'Make sure you get yellow sheets!' But to be very honest, I think that would be stretching the results a little too much.  "I don't know how far I would go to say don't get a red suitcase or red sheets, but the research hasn't been done yet, so we can't really rule that out completely."  Inspect the crevices and joints of your mattress and bed frame for any visible bugs - they are flat, oval-shaped and up to 5mm long and are red or brown in colour, depending on when they last fed  Look for black spots on your mattress - dried faeces from the bugs  Adult bugs can produce an unpleasant musty odour that you might be able to smell  Check your sheets for blood spots from squashed bed bugs  Look for any skin rash or itchy bump from bed bug bites	health

In a scathing attack, the source said the two all-out strikes this week were aimed at toppling the government and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.  The British Medical Association said the accusation was "ridiculous".  It comes as medical leaders called on the prime minister to end the stand-off, warning it posed a "significant threat to our whole health system".  Thirteen senior organisations, including the leaders of 10 royal colleges, have written to David Cameron saying it is up to him to intervene to bring both sides back to the negotiating table.  The letter said: "The ongoing impasse in the dispute between the government and junior doctors poses a significant threat to our whole healthcare system by demoralising a group of staff on whom the future of the NHS depends".  Was a deal with doctors ever possible?  What patients need to know  The royal colleges told the BBC the onus was on the government in power to come up with a solution - and to do that it needed to halt the imposition of the new contract, which has prompted the BMA to escalate the strike action.  But on Monday, a government source ruled out any compromise.  The source told the BBC BMA leaders had radicalised a "generation of junior doctors".  And if the government backed down, it would face similar industrial action by other unions, which were watching this dispute "like a hawk".  Junior doctors will walk out from 08:00 BST to 17:00 BST on Tuesday and Wednesday. This stoppage will see doctors stop providing emergency care for the first time in this dispute - and ever in the history of the NHS. The previous strikes have all involved cover being provided.  Instead, it will be left to consultants and middle-grade doctors to staff intensive care, accident and emergency and maternity units, along with nurses, midwives and other non-medical staff.  Hospitals have been putting contingency plans in place, including the postponement of more than 100,000 appointments and nearly 13,000 operations.  Extra GP appointments are being kept free for urgent appointments.  Earlier on Monday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the strikes as "extreme" and warned they would be "deeply worrying for patients" and could end up risking safety.  But BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said the government had the power to stop the industrial action.  "If you agree to lift imposition while talks resume, we will immediately call off the industrial action," he said.  Are you a patient who will have treatment disrupted by this week's strike?

Motoko was 16 years old when her eating disorder started. She would severely limit how much she ate and then started exercising excessively.  By the time she was 19, Motoko was dangerously underweight. She says her parents didn't know how to help her.  "They were negative about my illness," she says. "When I tried to see my doctor, they told me not to.  "My mother felt responsible, perhaps my father blamed her too."  Motoko's story is a familiar one. Stigma around eating disorders - for both sufferers and their families - prevent many people from coming forward.  "They see actions such as binging on food and then vomiting (bulimia) as shameful," says clinical psychiatrist Dr Aya Nishizono-Maher, a member of The Japan Society for Eating Disorders.  "They feel they have to hide it. Parents may think they are wasting food so that might stop them seeking help."  After more than 10 years, Motoko finally started getting the help she needed and she now attends one of the few eating disorder community support groups which receives money from the government.  She is now married and has a young son and says her life is much better since she started treatment.  But her experience as a teenager was very different.  "The school nurse saw me when I was so thin (but there still wasn't any help). Maybe it's something you cannot do anything about, but I wish I could have got the help I needed sooner."  • Affects men and women of all ages and cultural backgrounds  • But young women are most at risk.  The Japanese government said it was difficult to get an accurate picture of how many people are suffering with eating disorders because so few come forward for treatment.  Doctors say the prevalence in Japan is "comparable with that of the UK".  However, in 2014 only 10,000 people were getting treatment for eating disorders according to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. That's compared to 725,000 people in the UK, a country with almost half the population of Japan.  There is no family doctor referral system, so it's largely up to sufferers and their families to understand what's happening and to find psychiatric support themselves.  Doctors say that is a big ask for people desperately trying to hide their illness, or not even recognising they are unwell.  "The medical system is failing people with eating disorders," says Dr Nishizono-Maher.  "Hundreds of thousands of people are suffering in silence. There are very few services available to help people."  The president of the Japan Society for Eating Disorders, Dr. Toshio Ishikwa, said: "It's often too late by the time the patient is seen in a hospital.  "Their condition is very severe. Sometimes they are even close to death."  The government acknowledges it has a huge challenge on its hands.  It set up a project in 2014 to try and establish the extent of the problem and how best to deal with it.  Takanobu Matsuzaki, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, said: "We want to achieve widespread public recognition of eating disorders.  "We hold symposiums for the public and we publish information on our website to tell people about the programmes we offer."  The government partly funds only a handful of community support groups. Mr Matsuzaki says he wants more of these services to be made available.  "We want to set up local systems of support where their illness can be picked up early so people can be helped sooner," he explains.  Another major concern is the immense pressure women and girls in particular face to be very slim. Eating disorders are complex and rarely down to one thing, but there are concerns as to whether that pressure is having an impact.  Dr Ishikwa said: "Although the causes of eating disorders are unknown, there is the predominant cultural ideal that 'skinny is beautiful'. That has gone too far and we need to address it."  Japan's first and only magazine aimed at so called "plus-size" girls is trying to encourage people to acknowledge and celebrate different shapes and sizes, not just the "skinny ideal" portrayed in the mass media.  Harumi Kon, editor-in-chief of La Farfa magazine, started the publication two years ago after her own battles with accepting her body.  She said: "When I was a teenager I was so embarrassed and ashamed of myself... Because I was big.  "Now it's been 15-20 years but girls still feel like this. It's just not right. I want to tell girls 'just be yourself, be happy, be healthy'."	health

Mr Farron said his party would support Labour's bid to commit the UK to admitting 3,000 unaccompanied minors.  He said the UK should take its "fair share" of children who have already arrived in Europe, in addition to those it plans to resettle from Syria.  The government said it was taking action to help child refugees.  Home Secretary Theresa May said: "We're putting £10m into being able to being able to provide help and support for children who are in Europe."  On Monday the House of Commons will vote on a Labour amendment to the Immigration Bill to allow 3,000 child refugees into the UK.  The government announced last week it would take in as many as 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  This is on top of David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by the end of the decade.  But speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Farron said it was not enough, saying there were an estimated 30,000 lone refugee children already in Europe at risk of being trafficked or abused.  It was time for the UK to take its "fair share" and resettle 3,000 of them within its borders, the Lib Dem leader argued.  "I've been to the camps, I've seen families absolutely devastated, people who've fled war and persecution, the threat of death for them and their children and they took an enormously risky decision to cross the water the come to Europe. Why? Because what they left behind was riskier still," he said.  He added: "My question to every Conservative MP, to Theresa May and to David Cameron, is, 'If you were in the situation of these Syrian refugees, if your children were like these unaccompanied children in Europe now, what would you want other countries to do for you?' The answer is obvious," he added.  Some Conservatives MPs are believed to be considering backing Labour's amendment and Mr Farron predicted a government defeat was on the cards.  When asked if he thought they could win the vote, he said: "Yes, of course we can."  Home Secretary Theresa May said: "The question we need to ask ourselves, and we've worked with the UNHCR, is, 'What is in the best interests of these children?'"  Referring to the government's resettlement scheme she said: "That is about children at risk coming from the region, not just unaccompanied children because sometimes they can have a family member or a guardian with them but still be at risk, for example of exploitation or forced marriage."  "And also, we're putting £10m into being able to provide help and support for children who are in Europe," she added.  The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region and the UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk.  The UK government's scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage.  It will resettle children and their families "where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child".  Labour peer Lord Dubs - who has tabled the amendment to be debated on Monday - said that, while welcome, it "doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment."  He also questioned whether "the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36122966	Junior doctors' strikes: Jeremy Hunt rejects plan to pilot contract	Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has rejected a cross-party plan by MPs for a new NHS contract for junior doctors be piloted first in a bid to end the long-running row over its imposition.  In a letter, the MPs call for it to be independently evaluated in operation and a study made of its impact on mortality rates at weekends.  Junior doctors in England are to begin two more days of strikes on Tuesday.  Mr Hunt said the contract was already going to be brought in gradually.  He tweeted: "Labour 'plan' is opportunism - only 11% of junior docs go onto new contracts in August".  "We're staging implementation to ensure it works as intended. Any further delay just means we will take longer to eliminate weekend effect."  Will the dispute have a toxic legacy?  Was a deal with doctors ever possible?  Junior doctors are planning two one-day strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, walking out between 8am and 5pm each day.  If they go ahead, it will be the first time in the history of the NHS that junior doctors have walked out of accident and emergency units, urgent maternity services, resuscitation and mental health crisis teams.  Doctors union the BMA says its representatives will discuss the possibility of calling off the strikes if the government agrees to limited trials of the contract.  The last strike, which started on 6 April, led to more than 5,000 operations and procedures being postponed as a result of the 48-hour walkout.  Mr Hunt has argued that he wants to improve care on Saturdays and Sundays, saying research shows patients are more likely to die if they are admitted during a weekend.  The new contract - which junior doctors have so far rejected - would change the terms of their pay and conditions, particularly at weekends.  The health secretary has said he will now unilaterally impose the contract on junior doctors.  Mr Hunt has written to Mark Porter, the chairman of the BMA council, asking him to call off the strike and discuss other issues of concern raised by junior doctors.  His letter said: "The extreme action planned will be deeply worrying for patients and place enormous additional strain on our NHS at a time of intense pressure.  "I therefore appeal to you one final time to call off strike action that will see doctors withdraw potentially life-saving care, and to meet with me on Monday to discuss a better way forward."  In the cross-party letter - organised by Labour's shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander - the group of MPs wrote: "You will be aware that medical leaders, royal colleges and patient groups, have said the imposition or unilateral introduction of the contract is the wrong approach and risks permanent damage to the future of the medical workforce.  "If it remains your intention to introduce this new contract, we believe it should be piloted in a number of trusts/across a number of deaneries and for its impact on patients, staff and the 'weekend effect' to be independently evaluated."  The letter was also signed by Conservative Dr Dan Poulter, Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb and the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford.  NHS England says the proposed strike will put-back 112,856 outpatient appointments and 12,711 planned operations between 18 April and 2 May.  The president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Clare Marx, said the dispute was a "lose-lose situation" for all parties, but said the college backed the cross-party proposal as a way to end the row.  "Patients must come first. The dispute must come to an end," she said.  Dr Anne Rainsberry, national incident director for NHS England, said it was with "enormous regret that we find patients put in this position."  She added: "The NHS has been pulling out all the stops to minimise the risks to the quality and safety of care but this is an unprecedented situation during a time of heightened risk."  The BMA said it had given trusts several weeks' notice to plan ahead.  A spokesman added: "Junior doctors deeply regret disruption to patients but they are taking this action because they fundamentally believe the government's plans will be bad for patient care in the long term."  NHS England has put together a website with information for people needing healthcare over the strike period.  Are you a patient who will have treatment disrupted by next week's strike?

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36113773	Final piece of type 1 diabetes puzzle solved	A complete picture of the areas that the immune system attacks to cause type 1 diabetes has finally been revealed by scientists.  The study, published in the journal Diabetes, discovered the fifth and final critical target at which the immune system errantly takes aim.  The team at the University of Lincoln say the findings could help develop new ways to prevent and treat the disease.  Diabetes UK said the findings were "impressive".  In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells that make insulin - the hormone needed to keep blood sugar levels under control.  Studies looking at the unique antibodies made by patients with type 1 showed there were five key targets that the immune system attacked.  But working out exactly what they were has been like identifying someone from their silhouette.  Studies long ago discovered some of the targets, but the final one has proved elusive for two decades.  Dr Michael Christie, who led the research at the University of Lincoln, told the BBC: "With this new discovery, we have now finished identifying what the immune system is targeting - we have the complete picture."  The more technically named ones are largely involved in secreting or storing the hormone insulin.  Knowledge of some of these targets is already being used in a trial at King's College London that is aiming to stall the progression of type 1.  But Dr Christie says having the complete picture could help transform care for type 1 patients.  He said: "Once the immune system decides it wants to get rid of something it's very hard to stop, so diabetes has proved to be a difficult disease to prevent.  "So we're hoping that, by having identified the major targets in the disease, we can find ways to prevent it by blocking the immune response to these five proteins without leaving that person vulnerable to infections.  "With recent improvements in our understanding of the disease I'm very hopeful we'll develop a treatment now; I have a lot more confidence than even five years ago."  There are two main types of diabetes -  Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood.  Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes  Type 2 diabetes is largely caused by poor lifestyle. Around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2, and it tends to develop later in life than type 1.  Dr Emily Burns, from the charity Diabetes UK, said: "In order to prevent type 1 diabetes, we need to fully understand how the immune response that damages insulin-producing cells develops in the first place.  "Dr Christie's impressive research is helping us to do just that.  "We hope that the findings here will be used to improve the identification of those at risk of type 1 diabetes and, in the long term, inform the crucial development of therapies."	health

Mr Obama was criticised by pro-Brexit campaigners after he warned of the consequences of the UK leaving the EU.  UKIP's Nigel Farage said Mr Obama was "talking down Britain", while Tory Liam Fox said his views were "irrelevant".  Mr Obama, on a three-day UK visit, will meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later.  In a speech in London, the US president urged young people to "reject pessimism and cynicism" and to "know that progress is possible and our problems can be solved".  "Progress is not inevitable," he said and must be fought for. "Take a longer, more optimistic view of history."  Mr Obama's intervention on the EU issue came on his first full day in the UK and comes just weeks ahead of the 23 June in-out referendum.  Speaking at a joint news conference with Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday, Mr Obama said the US "wants Britain's influence to grow - including within Europe".  "The UK is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong European Union. It leverages UK power to be part of the EU.  "I don't think the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Obama's message on trade was "very blunt" and "really upped the ante" in the referendum debate.  Leave campaigner Mr Farage drew attention to the US president's terminology, saying his use of the phrase "back of the queue" rather than the more common American vernacular "back of the line" suggested Mr Obama was doing the prime minister's "bidding".  "I think that's shameful," he added.  Mr Fox said Mr Obama would be leaving the White House soon, and therefore his comments were "largely irrelevant".  Conservative MP Dominic Raab labelled Mr Obama a "lame-duck American president doing an old British friend a political favour".  Downing Street rejected suggestions that any lines had been fed to Mr Obama, saying the US president spoke for himself.  Sir Andrew Cahn, a former chief executive of UK Trade & Investment, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Britain would "miss out on something very important and valuable" if it left the EU and was not part of a proposed trade deal between the bloc and the US.  Former foreign secretary Lord Owen said "Britain needs to create new markets away from the EU".  Meanwhile, another prominent Leave campaigner - former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith - has tried to move the referendum debate on to immigration.  In an article in the Daily Mail, he says the introduction of a national living wage - a move he supported while in government - will "surely lead to another stampede to our borders".  He adds: "To make the Living Wage work for British people, we need to be able to control the number of people coming in."  Earlier on Saturday, Mr Obama visited the Globe Theatre, where celebrations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death are taking place.  He watched actors perform several scenes from Hamlet, later joining them on stage.  "That was wonderful. I didn't want it to stop," he said.  Later, he will hold talks with Labour leader Mr Corbyn.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36117230	Junior doctors strikes: 'Over 100,000 treatment delays' says NHS	More than 100,000 patients are expected to have their treatment disrupted as a result of next week's strike by junior doctors, NHS England says.  It says 112,856 outpatient appointments and 12,711 planned operations in the two-week window surrounding the strike are set to be put back.  But it says all trusts have plans to provide emergency and urgent care.  The BMA says it regrets the disruption but argues the government's own plans are bad for patients in the long-term.  The figures published by NHS England refer to operations and appointments postponed during the period between 18 April and 2 May.  Specific numbers for 26 and 27 April - when junior doctors plan to stage a full walkout from 08:00 to 17:00 BST each day - have not been released.  The last strike which started on 6 April led to more than 5,000 operations and procedures being postponed as a result of the 48-hour walkout.  For the first time in the history of the NHS, next week's strikes will see junior doctors walk out of accident and emergency, urgent maternity services, resuscitation and mental health crisis teams.  And sources close to the government say a longer planning process has been necessary because of the unprecedented nature of this strike.  Consultants, staff doctors and other healthcare staff will be drafted in to help in urgent and emergency care, and tried-and-tested plans are in place to deal with disruptions, NHS officials say.  In addition there will be more GP appointments available during the strike, NHS 111 will have increased call handling capacity and ambulances have been asked to offer extra support.  Dr Anne Rainsberry, national incident director for NHS England, said it was with "enormous regret that we find patients put in this position."  She added: "The NHS has been pulling out all the stops to minimise the risks to the quality and safety of care but this is an unprecedented situation during a time of heightened risk."  The British Medical Association said it had given trusts several weeks' notice to plan ahead.  A spokesman added: "Junior doctors deeply regret disruption to patients but they are taking this action because they fundamentally believe the government's plans will be bad for patient care in the long term.  "Crucially, there is still hope this action can be avoided. The BMA has been clear that it will call off next week's action if the health secretary removes the threat of imposition and returns to negotiations.  "It is not too late for the government to listen to the many voices raising concerns about its plans, get back around the negotiating table and end this dispute through talks."

They say this would offer a healthy alternative to sugary drinks.  Councils, which have responsibility for public health, want restaurants to do their bit to tackle childhood obesity.  All licensed premises have to provide free tap water in England, Wales and Scotland - but not Northern Ireland.  Yet one in five people are not aware of the rules, says the Local Government Association.  And a survey found that 15% of people who usually drink tap water at home never think of asking for water in cafes and restaurants.  Izzi Seccombe, community wellbeing spokeswoman at the Local Government Association, said: "While most restaurants will happily provide a glass of tap water on request, we're saying it shouldn't be something you have to ask for.  "Some people may be too embarrassed or find it awkward to ask for tap water. Others may simply forget it's an option," she said.  "For children it's an alternative to a sugary drink, while for adults it might dissuade them from ordering another alcoholic drink."  The LGA has previously called for tap water to be made more available in schools, nurseries and children's centres.  It wants the government to introduce initiatives to encourage children to drink more water as part of its childhood obesity strategy, which has been delayed and will probably not be published until the summer.  The Chancellor, George Osborne, recently announced a new sugar tax on the soft drinks industry to help tackle childhood obesity, which will be introduced in 2018.  One in 10 children in England is obese at the start of primary school and that rises to one in five by the age of 11.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36112694	Obama hits back at Boris Johnson's alleged smears	US president Barack Obama has hit back after Boris Johnson's comments about his "part-Kenyan" ancestry.  Mr Johnson said the removal of a bust of Churchill from Obama's office was seen by some as a sign of an "ancestral dislike of the British Empire".  The comments in article for The Sun were branded "idiotic" and "deeply offensive" by Churchill's grandson.  Mr Obama made clear his admiration for Britain's wartime leader in pointed remarks at a press conference.  He did not mention Mr Johnson by name but said he had a bust of Churchill outside the Treaty Room - his private office on the second floor of his official residence.  "Right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day - including on weekends when I'm going into that office to watch a basketball game - the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill," he said.  "It's there voluntarily because I can do anything on the second floor. I love the guy."  It had been in the Oval Office, he said, but: "There are only so many tables where you can put busts otherwise it starts to looks a little cluttered."  As the first African American president, he said, a bust of Martin Luther King would be "appropriate", to remind him "of all the hard work of a lot of people who somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office".  He added: "That's just on Winston Churchill. I think people should know that, know my thinking there."  Mr Johnson said he was "delighted" by Mr Obama's backing for Churchill, but did not respond to questions about whether he had been trying to suggest the US President had a grudge against Britain.  Speaking earlier on a visit to a fast food restaurant in his Uxbridge constituency, Mr Johnson said: "The crucial point is that I'm a big fan of Barack Obama - I was one of the first people to come out in favour of him ages ago.  "But I think there's a weird paradox when the President of the Unites States, a country that would never dream of sharing its sovereignty over anything, instructs or urges us politely to get more embedded in the EU, which is already making 60% of our laws.  "I think the issue really is about democracy - America guards its democracy very jealously and I think we should be entitled to do so as well."  Downing Street said Mr Johnson was recycling "false" claims in relation to Churchill's bust.  Churchill's grandson, Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, who is campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, called the article "deplorable" and "completely idiotic".  He told LBC Radio: "I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive."  Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for Mr Johnson to withdraw his comment, writing on Twitter: "Mask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog whistle racism from senior Tories."  Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell of Pittenweem said Mr Johnson's comments constituted an "unacceptable smear".  But UKIP leader Nigel Farage defended the comments, saying: "I think Obama, because of his grandfather and Kenya and colonisation, I think Obama bears a bit of a grudge against this country."  Stories about the removal of the Churchill bust were described by the White House in 2012 as "100% false".  "The bust still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room," a senior adviser said in a rebuttal.  A Churchill bust lent to President George Bush by Tony Blair was removed from the Oval Office along with other art lent to the Bush presidency after Mr Obama's 2009 inauguration "as is common practice at the end of every presidency", the White House said at the time.  A separate bust of Britain's wartime leader, that has been in the White House since the early 1960s, remains on display.  Mr Johnson said in his article: "No-one was sure whether the president had himself been involved in the decision", adding: "Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British Empire - of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender."  The London mayor, who penned a best-selling biography of Churchill, was born in New York but recently said he intends to renounce his American citizenship to prove his "commitment to Britain".	politics

Whitehall spending on temporary staff rose to £775m in 2014-15, the Public Accounts Committee said.  Chairman Meg Hillier urged ministers to "get a grip" and develop skills among the existing workforce.  The Cabinet Office said it had "stamped out excessive spending" and had more than halved costs from 2009-10, when it peaked at £2.7bn.  But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the Cabinet Office's recruitment policy was wasting taxpayers' money,  "We've got a government that claims to spend taxpayers' money wisely but wastes huge amounts of cash on temporary workers, some of whom are paid a thousand pounds a day," said Mr Watson.  "The amount the government spends on short term staff is rising significantly because it isn't recruiting civil servants with the right skills. Poor planning by the cabinet office is costing UK taxpayers dear."  The Public Accounts Committee report also found that 32 people on temporary contracts were paid more than £1,000 a day, although it said that represented a reduction.  The cost of temporary workers was up to between £679m and £775m in 2014-15 - depending on what data was used. This reached up to £1.3bn when coupled with consultants.  The cross-party committee, which scrutinises public spending, said specialist temporary staff often cost twice as much as permanent staff and suggested the government address "the skills gap across government".  The committee said the use of temporary staff was "justified only when it is not feasible for departments to maintain the necessary skills in-house or to borrow those skills from elsewhere within the civil service".  Although spending controls brought in during 2010 had had an effect, spending had been on the rise again since 2011-12, they said.  Central procurement deals were also not used for around half of consultancy and temporary staff assignments, they said.  The committee's Labour chair, Meg Hillier, said public money was being "wasted because of poor workforce planning".  "There is a place for buying in expert advice and using temporary staff if there is a skills gap but departments first need to be sure they do not have access to these skills in-house. Getting this wrong costs the taxpayer dear.  "Filling permanent roles with temporary staff is short-sighted and does nothing to address underlying skills shortages in the civil service, nor to develop its expertise. When temps leave, valuable experience leaves with them.  "The government needs to get a grip, identify where skills are lacking in-house and put a proper plan in place to deliver those skills through the recruitment and development of high quality, permanent staff."  But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: "This government is scrutinising spend like never before. We've stamped out excessive spending on consultants and put in place stringent spending controls. The total spend on consultants is still less than half of that in 2009-10."  He said the department was "actively building" skills but sometimes needed specialist expertise quickly on complex projects.  "But we only do this when the key skills are not readily available within the Civil Service and where it delivers better value for taxpayers," he added.	politics

It is crucial for sex as it produces semen and helps with ejaculation. It can also affect urination.  But it is also the leading cause of cancer in men, with 40,000 diagnosed each year, Prostate Cancer UK says.  A survey by the charity showed nearly one in five men did not even know they had a prostate and men were "blind" to the risk of cancer.  The gland, which is about the size of a walnut, sits below the bladder and in front of the rectum.  It produces the fluid that nourishes sperm.  Prostate Cancer UK chief executive Angela Culhane, told the BBC News website: "Men are very ignorant, and it's dangerous because prostate cancer is actually the most common cancer in men.  "The things it does affect - ejaculation and sexual function, urine flow and incontinence - are not regularly talked about over the dinner table or in the pub."  Nearly 11,000 men die from prostate cancer each year.  It can have few symptoms in the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination:  Ms Culhane said: "A man in his 30s with none of the risk factors shouldn't be overly worried - but for men at higher risk, they should have a conversation with their GP or one of our specialist nurses.  "If they have a family history, are black [black men are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer as the overall population] or are over 50, then, generally, they should be thinking about having a conversation.  "As a country, we need to wake up and stop men dying needlessly.  Ignoring prostate cancer won't beat it - only fighting it will."  Former England and Newcastle United footballer Les Ferdinand, who saw his grandfather suffer with the disease at the end of his life, said: "I'm not surprised so many men don't know what their prostate does - it's an easy gland to ignore.  "In fact, until prostate cancer affected my family, my knowledge of the prostate was pretty slim.  "Don't ignore the statistics and don't ignore your risk.  "Join the fight to beat the disease."	health

A report by the Royal College of Surgeons found a third of local NHS health bosses in England put restrictions on access to surgery.  But it says this goes against official guidance and can prolong patient pain.  However, some local NHS groups criticised in the report say their polices are based on good evidence.  The Royal College of Surgeons has been increasingly alarmed about the rationing of surgery in the NHS in the tough financial climate.  Its report is based on freedom of information returns from nearly all of the 209 clinical commissioning groups in England and all seven health boards in Wales.  While some CCGs have voluntary policies in place, where patients are encouraged to stop smoking or lose weight, others have introduced mandatory policies, which means patients have to meet fixed criteria before surgery.  The college says mandatory policies are "a cause for concern" and it fears patients with a high body mass index (BMI) or who smoke are becoming "soft targets" for NHS savings.  The report reveals 31% of CCGs and one health board in Wales have at least one policy requiring people to lose weight or stop smoking before they can be referred for routine surgery.  Local NHS groups which compel patients to meet fixed criteria before surgery include:  Dr Hari Pathmanathan, who chairs East and North Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said there were good reasons why they asked some patients to lose weight and stop smoking before being given an anaesthetic.  "These patients are much more likely to suffer serious breathing problems, get infections and have heart, kidney and lung complications," he said.  "It also takes them longer to recover, and they have a higher risk of dying under anaesthetic.  "It is for these health reasons that patients who have a higher risk because of their weight are not be booked for routine surgery until they have lost enough weight to improve the outcomes of their surgery, although no-one would be asked to wait for more than nine months."  Dr Pathmanathan added that every patient's case was considered individually, based on their health needs, and the restrictions were for planned surgery only.  The report suggests one in five CCGs has mandatory policies on BMI levels before hip and knee replacement surgery, while 4% have mandatory policies on getting patients to stop smoking before hip and knee replacement surgery.  Of the CCGs that responded, 22% reported having at least one "voluntary" policy in place.  The Royal College of Surgeons said any blanket ban on surgery based on a patient's weight or whether they smoked was wrong and not supported by national guidance.  Instead, president Clare Marx said, patients should be encouraged to sign up to programmes to help them stop smoking and manage their weight while awaiting surgery.  "NHS surgical treatment should be based on clinical guidance and patients should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis," she said.  "In some instances, a patient might need surgery in order to help them to do exercise and lose weight.  "While it is difficult to categorically prove such policies are aimed at saving money, it is unlikely to be a coincidence that many financially challenged CCGs are restricting access to surgery."  She added National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance did not support these mandatory bans for routine surgery.  British Orthopaedic Association president Tim Wilton said there was no clinical or financial justification for refusing to fund hip or knee replacements.  "Good outcomes can be achieved for patients regardless of whether they smoke or are obese, even at BMIs of over 50, and these surgeries are highly cost effective, typically delivering sustained pain relief for a cost that equates to just £7.50 a week," he said.  "Hard-and-fast rules also undermine the NHS's ability to involve patients in decisions about their own care, and are a distraction from the task at hand: making sure patients receive the best possible advice and care, to enable them to make the best possible decisions for their health - including losing weight and stopping smoking where appropriate."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36102709	UK to take thousands of child refugees	The UK will take in up to 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  The government called the move the "largest resettlement programme for children in the world".  It is in addition to UK prime minister David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by 2020.  But critics said it would do nothing to help the thousands of lone refugee children who had made it to Europe, but were at risk of trafficking and abuse.  The government scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage. It will resettle children and their families "where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child."  Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 "with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament", the government said.  The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk.  Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: "We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK.  "We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made."  The scheme will be reviewed after two years.  The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the "vital protection and support they need" in the UK.  But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included "nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse".  "Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too."  And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a "cynical" ploy - a bid to "buy off" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps next week.  He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps: "Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity."  And Labour's Lord Dubs, who moved the amendment to the Immigration Bill calling on the government to take in 3,000 child refugees already in Europe, said: "While I welcome this proposal, it doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment."  "You also have to wonder whether the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate."  The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36102710	UK to step up pressure over IS 'genocide' after MPs' vote	The UK government has promised to step up pressure for official recognition of atrocities committed by so-called Islamic State as acts of genocide.  It follows a unanimous Commons vote condemning the persecution of Christians and Yazidis.  Tory MPs defied orders to abstain in the vote, which is one of the few times actions have been declared genocide in a war that is still going on.  The Foreign Office said the debate had "clarified" its position.  The MPs want the UK government to make an immediate referral to the UN Security Council with a view to giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction. They say this will enable the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood told MPs he personally believed what was happening in Iraq and Syria was genocide but added: "This ultimately is a matter for courts to decide. It is not for governments to be the prosecutor, the judge or indeed jury."  He said so-called Islamic State - also known as Daesh - would be "held to account for its barbaric crimes against the majorities and minorities involved - Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, Kurds and other groups" by being defeated and exposed as a "failing organisation"​.  He said efforts to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, in 2014, had been vetoed by Russia and China and any fresh resolution "could very well be blocked again".  But he said "further discussions are taking place", adding: "We are now in a different place from where we were in 2014."  Foreign Office sources said the Commons debate had helped "clarify" the government's position and it would raise the issue of genocide with its partners on the UN Security Council, but it did not want to act unilaterally as this would not have the desired effect.  Crossbench peer Lord Alton sought to keep pressure on the government following Wednesday's debate, telling peers the government risked being in contempt of Parliament if it ignored the vote as "non-binding".  Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay of St Johns replied that the government would do "everything it can to gather evidence for judicial bodies" but it wanted to be "sure of getting a result" in the Security Council.  Conservative MP Fiona Bruce, who tabled Wednesday's Commons motion, told MPs: "Genocide is a word of such gravity that it should never be used readily. It is rightly known as the crime above all crimes.  "For this reason it is incumbent upon us to prevent the term from devaluation or overuse. But such caution must not stop us from naming a genocide when one is taking place."  She told how MPs had heard the "truly harrowing" personal testimony of a brave 16-year-old Yazidi girl, who was seized along with others from her community by Islamic State fighters, witnessing her father and brother killed in front of her.  She said Yazidis and Christians had been targeted explicitly because of their religion and ethnicity.  "Recognising the actions of Daesh as genocide should therefore help inject further momentum into the international efforts to stop the killings," she added.  "It would hopefully lead to more active safeguarding of those members of religious minorities on the ground whose lives and very communities currently hang in the balance.  "It may also make new recruits including those from the UK think twice about joining given the ramifications of being caught."  Conservative MP David Burrowes said MPs would not stop until the government was held to account over its response to the atrocities.  "We will return, again and again until the government properly make that justifiable referral to the Security Council."  Fellow Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said the government should not hide behind legal precedent as a reason not to act.	politics

Opening a special "Humble Address", the PM said she had led a "gentle evolution" of the monarchy during her 64-year reign.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said whatever people's views on the monarchy, the "vast majority" agreed she had served her country.  Crowds lined the streets in Windsor as the monarch took part in a walkabout, after royal gun salutes were fired from each of the UK's capital cities.  Mr Cameron paid tribute to her "extraordinary service", which he said was "a joy for us all to celebrate, to cherish and to honour".  He added: "In this modern Elizabethan era, Her Majesty has led a gentle evolution of our monarchy.  "From that first televised Christmas Day message, over three decades before cameras were allowed into this House, to the opening up of the royal palaces and the invention of the royal walkabout, she's brought the monarchy closer to the people while also retaining its dignity."  Praising her international diplomacy, the PM said that after a visit to Balmoral, the Queen could claim to be the only woman to have ever driven the King of Saudi Arabia around in a car.  Mr Corbyn, who has said he is a Republican "at heart" but is not interested in trying to replace the monarchy, offered the Queen his "warmest greetings" and said he was "fully in favour of our country having leaders of a finer vintage".  "Today we're talking about a highly respected individual who is 90 - and whatever different views people across this country have about the institution, the vast majority share an opinion that Her Majesty has served this country and has overwhelming support with a clear sense of public service and public duty," he said, before joking that she may be, like him, an Arsenal fan.  Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, highlighted the Queen's "enduring and special" relationship with Scotland, and recalled her opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 "after a recess of nearly 300 years".  "I'd like to take the opportunity to put on record the appreciation of people in Scotland to Her Majesty, who has had a lifetime connection with and a commitment to the country," he said.  Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron she had provided "immeasurable constancy" during a time of great upheaval.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639	Q&A: Police and crime commissioners	Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.  PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing.  The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public.  There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.  In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales.  Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.  In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor.  This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.  Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation.  New measures proposed in the Policing and Crime Bill, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to take on responsibility for fire and rescue services. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more "efficiency and effectiveness" but the Fire Brigades Union called the idea "dangerous" and a "half-baked suggestion" and the Local Government Association said it saw no "pressing need" for the change.  Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, was visited by no voters at all.  Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold a review into how the polls were conducted. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: "The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with."  All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.  A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.  The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  The coalition agreement published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police "more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper "Policing in the 21st Century" and enacted in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, which became law in 2011.  London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary.  In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.  Manchester's PCC Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.  PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.  PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance "should be judged solely by the electorate" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.  And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.  In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable.  But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee said it seemed "very easy" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for "insubstantial" reasons and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.  In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.  When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities.  In 2013, BBC research revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.  Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.  During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries and standards of PCCs.  In 2014, South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the "important issues" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered "without distraction".  Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a "discredited experiment" and say PCCs should be abolished.  Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes, with a judge calling the suspension "irrational and perverse", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: "The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed."  Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she would not be standing for re-election. A report last year found she may not have been properly insured when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for taking part in a documentary and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a statement on her website when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: "I am content that I have delivered what I said I would."  Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, apologised for using a chauffeur-driven car that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.  When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, said PCCs should be scrapped and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones died in July 2014 aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month. The turnout for the by-election was just 10.4% - lower than the 12% in the West Midlands in 2012 - and the cost of the poll was estimated at £3.7m, nearly £20 for every vote cast.  Supporters argue that elected commissioners make policing more accountable and responsive to local needs because, for example, they consult with victims of crime when setting policing priorities. They also say PCCs bring valuable outside experience to forces.  Home secretary Theresa May, who introduced the role, says PCCs "have engaged with the public over the past three-and-a-half years in ways that police authorities never did or could".  In 2012 opponents warned PCCs could lead to the politicisation of the police, with commissioners favouring headline-grabbing initiatives. They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces.  Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.  Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were "invisible" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels.	politics

The Culture Secretary has faced calls to withdraw from press regulation decisions after news of his relationship with an escort.  He said politicians must "tread very carefully" on press regulation.  He also said the government had an "open mind" on implementing the rest of the Leveson review into the press.  Making his first Commons appearance since the story broke, Mr Whittingdale said he had "considerable sympathy with the victims of press abuse" and that he'd had a number of meetings with some of them.  Backbench MP Simon Danczuk accused him of breaking the prime minister's promise to implement the 2011 inquiry in full.  "Having had my faith perhaps tested to the utmost I still believe that press freedom is a vitally important component of a free society and we should tread very carefully," Mr Whittingdale said.  Campaigners are calling for outstanding parts of the Leveson review - which would require newspapers to pay libel costs even if they won a case brought against them - to be implemented.  Mr Whittingdale said the government was "keeping an open mind about when to implement the remaining section", acknowledging a decision was needed "relatively quickly".  He also added that cost provision for victims could not come into effect until there was a "recognised regulator" in place.  Mr Whittingdale's opposite number, Labour's shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle joked that he had been distracted by "extra curricular activities" - adding that she was referring to his "moonlighting for the Leave campaign" ahead of the EU referendum.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36094112	Nato spending target 'met by MoD accounting changes'	A government pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence is only being met through accounting changes, MPs have claimed.  Chancellor George Osborne last year said the UK would continue to meet the target, set by Nato for member nations.  But the cross-party Defence Committee said that including what is spent on intelligence gathering and war pensions could be seen as "creative accounting".  Labour said that amounted to "fiddling the books" but the Ministry of Defence said it was all within Nato guidelines.  The UK has met the 2% target consistently over the past decade, one of the few Nato members to do so, although spending on defence as a share of GDP has steadily fallen over the past 30 years.  The government is facing claims that it had to include measures such as intelligence gathering and war pensions - which were not previously counted as defence spending - in order to make the figures add up.  The cross-party committee warned that this "redefinition" to some degree undermined the government's claims that the 2% figure represented a significant increase in defence spending.  "We note that the Nato minimum would not have been fulfilled if UK accounting practices had not been modified, albeit in ways permitted by Nato guidelines," it said.  "The only way that the Ministry of Defence can refute claims of 'creative accounting' is to outline, clearly and unambiguously, what the new inclusions are, how much they constitute, and from which department each was previously funded."  Last year with much fanfare - and after strong pressure from the US - the government announced it would continue to meet Nato's target of spending 2% of the nation's wealth on defence.  While this report stops short of accusing the government of fiddling the books to meet that goal, it does say ministers are open to the charge of creative accounting.  The MPs say deciphering the MoD's accounts has not been easy. But they confirm that items previously not defined as defence spending - such as war pensions and some intelligence gathering - are now being included to achieve the 2% pledge.  The Defence Committee says the government needs to be clear about what counts as defence spending and also how it will continue meeting the goal in the coming years.  The committee also called on ministers to explain how they would continue to meet the 2% target up to 2020 given the pressures from public sector pay and fact that this year's total included a number of one-off items which would not be repeated in future years.  "We remain to be convinced that the current financial settlement is sufficient to rectify the decline of defence as a national priority," it said.  "The government must be clear that 2% is a minimum - not a target - and be prepared to increase defence expenditure further in order to reflect the increasing threats faced by both the UK and our allies."  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, committee chairman Julian Lewis said the government should have "flagged" that it was including categories of expenditure not previously counted - saying it was "trying to amass every last little bit...in order to scrape over the 2% threshold".  Labour has seized on the committee's report, accusing the government of sharp practice.  "After the crippling cuts to the armed forces imposed by the Tories throughout the last parliament, we were promised that 2015 would mark a turning point," said shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry.  "Instead, it's increasingly clear that the 2% commitment is being delivered not through increases in frontline defence spending but by fiddling the books.  "Time and again on defence, the Tories are shown to be all rhetoric and no reality, and it is our armed forces who are paying the price."  But the Ministry of Defence said this was "nonsense" and the UK's military would enjoy a big increase in resources over the next four years.  "When defence spending will increase by £5bn over this parliament, it is nonsense to suggest there is no new funding," a spokesman said.  "Our plans will deliver more ships, more planes, more troops at readiness, better equipment for special forces, and more on cyber to help keep Britain safe."	politics

The Zika virus, which is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, triggered a global health emergency this year.  Last week the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the virus causes severe birth defects.  The latest research showed mapping Zika was more complex than simply defining where the mosquito can survive.  One of the researchers, Dr Oliver Brady from the University of Oxford, told the BBC: "These are the first maps to come out that really use the data we have for Zika - earlier maps were based on Zika being like dengue or chikungunya.  "We are the first to add the very precise geographic and environmental conditions data we have on Zika."  By learning where Zika could thrive the researchers could then predict where else may be affected. The researchers confirmed that large areas of South America, the focus of the current outbreak, are susceptible.  In total, 2.2 billion people live in areas defined as being "at risk".  The infection is suspected of leading to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.  The at-risk zones in South America include long stretches of coastline as well as cities along the Amazon river and its tributaries snaking through the continent.  And in the US, Florida and Texas could sustain the infection when temperatures rise in summer.  Dr Brady added: "Mosquitoes are just one condition needed for Zika to spread but there's a whole range of other ones.  "It needs to be warm enough for Zika to replicate inside the mosquito and for there to be a large enough [human] population to transmit it."  Both Africa and Asia have large areas that could be susceptible to the virus, the researchers said.  However, the study cannot answer why large numbers of cases have not already been reported.  One possible explanation is that both continents have already had large numbers of cases and the populations there have become largely immune to the virus.  An alternative is that cases could be being misdiagnosed as other infections such as dengue fever or malaria.  Europe seems likely to be unaffected, but that could change as more evidence emerges on which mosquitoes the viruses can spread in.	health

The party blamed an "administrative error" for failing to register the accommodation costs of activists involved in the Battlebus 2015 operation.  A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.  The Tories insisted the Battlebus operation was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  But Channel 4 said its investigation suggested the operation was focused at a local level, so should have been declared as such.  An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: "The commission is currently conducting an investigation into the Conservative Party's 2015 General Election spending return and will consider carefully any new allegations that are raised as part of the Channel 4 news programme.  "In line with the commission's enforcement policy, the commission does not comment on ongoing investigations, as to do so may hinder the conduct of the investigation."  The Conservative Party issued a statement saying its activists were campaigning "across the country for the return of a Conservative government" and, as such, their activities were regarded as national not local expenditure.  "As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus," it said.  "However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return."  "The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning."	politics

A Freedom of Information request by the Huffington Post UK found the cost of a journey transporting just government documents had often exceeded £100.  The total bill could be higher as figures for additional trips using pool cars were not available.  The government said there had been a "substantial reduction" in the cost of ministerial cars since 2011.  David Cameron announced plans to shrink the bill for ministerial cars shortly after coming to office in 2010, and the number of ministers with access to their own chauffeur-driven car was cut.  The practice of carrying ministers' "red boxes" in official cars is used for sensitive documentation.  In 2010, journalist Sarah Vine, the wife of the then education secretary Michael Gove, wrote that while her husband could travel home by public transport, his red box would travel separately "in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car".  The red boxes travelled alone using the Government Car Service 1,910 times between 2012-13 and 2014-15, with the number of journeys rising over the course of the three years.  Source: Freedom of Information request to the Department for Transport  Since 2012, pool cars have also been used by departments but their use is not recorded by the DfT, the department said.  Labour MP Graham Jones told the Huffington Post: "The Tories said they'd clamp down on wasteful spending yet they still allow hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to be spent ferrying round briefcases in chauffeur-driven cars."  But the Department for Transport said the total cost of carrying ministers' paperwork was just 5% of the total spent on the Government Car Service‎ and that it was committed to ensuring the service provided value for money.  A spokeswoman added: "That is why, since 2010, the number of cars that make up the service has been reduced from 227 to 78.  "We have also been working hard to cut our operating costs in order to further reduce the cost to the public purse.  "Before April 2012, all cars were part of a government car pool and could be booked separately by ministers. After April 2012, cars were allocated to departments as departmental pool cars for use by ministers. These cars are managed by each department."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36092505	PMQs: Cameron vows to 'finish the job' on academies	David Cameron has defended controversial plans to force all state schools in England to become academies, saying it is time to "finish the job".  During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn cited opposition to the "top down reorganisation" from teachers, parents and some Tory MPs.  He said good schools should not be distracted by "arbitrary changes".  Sources said the government was likely to guarantee no small rural schools would close as a result of the shakeup.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told ministers are having lots of conversations with Conservative MPs to tackle their concerns - but are not intending to back down on the policy.  Academies, which started under the Labour government, are funded directly by central government and are independent of local authority control.  In March's Budget, the government announced the move to force all of England's state schools that have not yet converted to academies to do so.  Some Conservative MPs have questioned the wisdom of forcing all schools to make the switch, which has has been outlined in a white paper, in particular the impact on small rural schools if academy chains are not willing to take them over.  Conservative backbencher Andrew Percy said it was "a very hard sell" to tell good or outstanding schools they must change their governance arrangements.  "The government needs to do a lot more before it's convinced myself and a lot of backbenchers that forcing academisation is necessary," he added.  The enforced change has also been opposed by teaching unions and the Local Government Association - which said the government had highlighted improvements in the primary sector, where 85% of schools are council-maintained.  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said critics of the proposal have raised "important issues".  Mr Corbyn asked the PM to explain "why good school leaders should focus their time and resources not on educating children but on arbitrary changes imposed from above".  Mr Cameron said schools that were performing well had "nothing to fear" from being converted to academies.  The reform had been "hugely effective" he said, adding: "We have seen massive improvements in our schools because of academies and we say let's get on with it, finish the job and give all our children a great opportunity."  Schools Minister Nick Gibb told BBC News the plan for all schools to become academies by 2022 was about "spreading best practice".  Mr Gibb said this was a "voluntary process" but added that as more schools convert it would not be viable to have two systems of governance "operating in parallel".  Meanwhile, the Department for Education's accounts were criticised by a financial watchdog.  National Audit Office head Amyas Morse said the department had failed to properly account for spending by academies, saying there was not enough accurate information for Parliament to account for the public money.  The NAO said there was a level of "misstatement and uncertainty" which meant the truth and fairness of the accounts, which have just been published, could not be verified.	politics

The Public Accounts Committee said the UK had shown "agility, bravery and innovation" in helping to contain the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and deal with famine in the Horn of Africa.  But performance in war zones like Syria and Yemen needs "fuller understanding".  It also urged the UK to take a lead in trying to simplify UN aid structures.  The UK has one of the largest foreign aid budgets in the world and last year became the first G7 country to meet an international commitment to spend 0.7% - about £12bn - of its national income on overseas development.  The government has sought to refocus spending in recent years amid criticism from MPs on the right of the Conservative Party that the foreign aid budget has been protected from cuts since 2010 during a time of prolonged domestic austerity.  Spending on humanitarian emergencies trebled in the four years to 2014-15, the cross-party committee said in its report. The Department for International Development spent £1.28bn dealing with overseas crises - 14% of its £9.5bn budget.  The Department for International Development (DfID), the MPs concluded, was doing a "good job" in responding to more than 20 crises around the world caused by conflict, natural disaster, disease and drought.  It singled out for praise the UK's contribution to fighting the Ebola outbreak, noting that it had quickly mobilised resources to transfer 164 staff from other areas to Sierra Leone - putting some lower priority activities on hold to focus on the crisis.  Other countries in which "tangible results" had been achieved include the Philippines, where a UK team has been helping build resilience against typhoons following the devastation wrought by typhoon Haiyan in 2013.  But while acknowledging that DfID was working in many difficult and dangerous environments, the committee said it did not often know what constituted success in terms of value for money.  While the performance of individual interventions is assessed, the committee said protracted engagements in war zones such as Syria and Yemen were not subject to the same "structured approach" as others, limiting the lessons being learnt.  Among the committee's recommendations are more focus on assessing "longer-running and more complex crises", a review of the use of external contractors, ensuring staff and equipment can always be deployed overseas at short notice, better tracking of how UK funds are spent by other bodies, including UN agencies whose "overlapping remits", the MPs said, can often lead to inefficiency.  "It is important to recognise the Department for International Development has had a positive impact in responding to some desperate situations around the world," said Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the committee.  "It is also important that, however public money is spent, the government is held to account for that spending.  "In responding to crises, achieving value for money means critical support can be provided more effectively to more of the people who need it. It is vital it looks constantly at the way it spends public money and ensures it is being used to best advantage."  In response, DfID said it welcomed the MPs' recognition "of the success it has had in tackling a range of crises".  "The government's aid strategy places a heavy focus on ensuring value for money, and the UK is playing a lead role in discussions on the future of the international humanitarian system and overseas development, including the role of UN agencies," a spokeswoman added.	politics

He won a by-election triggered by the death of Lord Avebury, a contest in which only three existing members of the House of Lords were able to vote.  Viscount Thurso was a member of the Lords for four years between 1995 and 1999 before leaving after Labour's reforms axed most hereditary members.  He then served as MP for Caithness and Sutherland for 14 years until last May.  Under existing Lords procedures, only existing Lib Dem hereditary peers in the Lords were entitled to vote in the contest. All of them - the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, the Earl of Glasgow and Lord Addington - voted for Viscount Thurso.  The six other candidates were Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor, the great grandson of the former Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George, Lord Calverley, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Kennet, Earl Russell and Lord Somerleyton.  John Thurso is the grandson of Archibald Sinclair, the former Liberal Party leader who was a member of Winston Churchill's coalition government during World War Two.  He lost his parliamentary seat in last year's election and has since been appointed chair of VisitScotland.  Prior to Monday's election, each candidate was asked to submit a 75-word statement about their background and relevant experience.  The election has been described as a farce by Lord Avebury's son John Lubbock, who likened the contest and size of the electorate to a rotten borough from the 18th Century.  Reforms to the Lords by the last Labour government left just 92 hereditary peers in place. Since then vacancies arising from the death of members have been filled through a series of by-elections.	politics

Ministers wanted employees to organise the payment of union dues themselves by other means such as direct debit.  But unions argued that this would be more complicated for members and so lead to a loss of funds.  Lord Bridges of Headley announced a "pause" in the plans, saying there were "cannons" attacking them on all sides.  He told peers the government would change the Trade Union Bill to remove the end to "check-off" at its next stage in the House of Lords, saying the move had never been intended to undermine the union movement.  "Arguments have been made with considerable vim and vigour that by ending check-off and moving to direct debit, those on low pay and especially those who have pay day loans might have to cease being trade union members or have to pay extra bank charges," he said.  "Again, this is not our intention and never has been."  The payment of subscriptions by deduction from wages can now continue - providing the union bears the administrative cost.  The Conservative peer who led the parliamentary campaign against the move, Lord Balfe, said he was "delighted" to be able to tear up the speech he had been about to make opposing the government.  "I think it was clear to anyone who looked at the detail that the government's proposals on check-off stood to do considerable damage both to the unions themselves and to their members and potential members," he said.  "I was particularly concerned about the impact on low paid, mostly female workers, who stood to lose out on the protection and benefits of trade union membership."  The TUC welcomed the U-turn, thanking all of those who had lobbied the government over the issue.  "Banning workers from choosing to pay union subs in a convenient way through their payroll would, as many have warned, damaged industrial relations and morale in key services," said its general secretary Frances O'Grady.  "While this is an important milestone, the TUC remains opposed to the Trade Union Bill in its entirety and will continue to push for further changes when it is debated again in the House of Commons next week."  Ministers are standing by other key aspects of the bill, such as the introduction of electronic balloting and restrictions on political funds used by unions for campaigning, despite a series of defeats in the Lords.	politics

Doctors are to take part in the first ever stoppages involving emergency care next Tuesday and Wednesday.  It will see medics walk out of A&E, intensive care and maternity units.  But the General Medical Council has now issued advice saying striking may not be the "right option" in some places.  And it urged those considering taking action to take "reasonable steps to satisfy themselves" that patients would be safe.  The GMC said it had not received any warnings from hospitals, but was making the judgement based on the scale of the walkouts being planned.  There has been fears raised by some that smaller hospitals in particular may find it difficult to cope during the stoppages.  The GMC also expressed concern about the cumulative impact of the dispute - nearly 25,000 operations and treatments have had to be postponed because of industrial action.  NHS England is currently checking with NHS trusts that they have adequate contingency plans in place for next week and is due to meet leaders at the British Medical Association on Thursday to discuss whether junior doctors are needed to come in anywhere.  There is an agreed escalation procedure in place which allows NHS bosses to ask the BMA to allow its representatives to request doctors do not strike if needed.  Plans will also be in place on the day to allow doctors to be called in if there is a major incident.  There have been four strikes in the contract dispute since the start of the year.  On each occasion, junior doctors have provided emergency cover.  But next week's walkouts - taking place from 08:00 BST to 17:00 BST on both days - will involve all services. Although consultants, nurses and midwives will still be working.  This has never happened before in the history of the NHS and comes after the government announced it would be imposing a new contract on doctors from the summer.  GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said he recognised there was "anger and frustration" in the profession, but added it was not up to the GMC to comment on the rights and wrongs of the dispute.  But he said: "For every doctor affected these are difficult and worrying times and feelings are understandably running high.  "We know all doctors will want to do their utmost to reduce the risk of harm to patients and this advice is designed to help them achieve that."  NHS England said it was talking to hospitals about the plans they were putting in place.  Jeremy Taylor, chief executive of National Voices, a coalition of charities and patient groups, said: "This is significant as it is the first official acknowledgement that patients could be put at increased risk by the all-out strike action."  BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said the union was working with the NHS to ensure care remained safe.  "The critical message for patients is that anyone who needs emergency care during the days of industrial action will get it, the difference is that it will be provided by senior doctors rather than junior doctors."	health

The first survival data on using ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination showed 69% of patients, in a trial on 142, were still alive after two years.  UK doctors leading the trial said the results were "very encouraging".  Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is the sixth most common cancer in the UK  It kills more than 2,000 people in Britain each year.  Data from a separate melanoma study on Merck's immunotherapy pembrolizumab also showed an increase in survival.  The drug also works by cutting the immune system's brakes.  The results of an early stage trial, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed a third of patients lived for 12 months with no sign of the tumour growing.  The immune system is a powerful defence against infection. However, there are many "brakes" built in to stop it attacking our own tissues.  Cancer - which is a corrupted version of healthy tissue - can take advantage of those brakes to evade assault.  Ipilimumab and nivolumab are designed to cut the brakes.  Both have become standard therapies in melanoma, but most researchers believe combination therapy will be essential.  The trial showed the survival rate after two years for ipilimumab alone was 53% and no patient's tumours had completely disappeared.  The equivalent figures for combination therapy were 69% and 22%.  However, more than half of patients had severe to life-threatening side effects which stopped their treatment.  Dr James Larkin, who ran part of the trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, told the BBC News website: "It is very encouraging to see that survival rate.  "It will be important in terms of working out the benefit of these treatments in the longer term, but nevertheless it's a relatively small study still."  A much larger trial involving nearly 1,000 patients has already started releasing data, but has not run for long enough to produce survival figures.  Vicky Brown, 61 and from Cardiff, was diagnosed with malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and breast in April 2013.  She started the combination therapy later that year.  "It worked within a month. There were lumps I could actually feel and they disappeared quite quickly," she told the BBC.  She did face severe side effects including an upset liver and inflamed bowels and a year later the cancer returned.  She is now on her second course of combination immunotherapy, which again seems to have shrunk the tumours.  "My granddaughter is now coming up to four and I now have a second grandchild and not to have been part of their lives would have been heartbreaking, so I'm really thankful," she added.  Historically, when a treatment fails and a cancer starts to grow again then that drug has become useless. But Dr Larkin thinks "we're dealing with something different here".  He added: "This combination of drugs alters the balance of immune system, two years down the line the immune system might have stopped recognising the tumour.  "To me it is extremely encouraging that giving the combination again we can reintroduce recognition by the immune system - it is like a booster dose."  Both drugs were developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Prof Richard Marais, from Cancer Research UK, said the results were "exciting" and "offer new hope to melanoma patients and their families".  However, he added: "It's important to remember that there's an increased likelihood of severe side effects when these drugs are combined.  "We need to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from this combination and also which patients are most likely to experience the side effects.  "That will help doctors to ensure each patient gets the best treatment they need."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36082872	Dementia threat 'may be less severe' than predicted	The predicted explosion of dementia cases may be less severe than previously thought, a study in Nature Communications suggests.  Researchers looked at three areas of England, 20 years apart, and found new rates of dementia were lower than past trends would suggest.  They say improvements in men's health is the most likely explanation.  But charities warn against complacency, with more than 200,000 dementia cases diagnosed each year in the UK.  Researchers, funded by the Medical Research Council and dementia charities, interviewed about 7,500 people aged 65 and over living in Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle in the early 1990s.  The whole process, which included detailed questionnaires about cognition and lifestyle, was repeated in the same way two decades later.  They found rates of new cases of dementia had been fairly steady in women over this time, but had fallen in men.  Extrapolating their findings to apply to the rest of the UK, they say there would be 40,000 fewer cases of the disease than estimates put forward two decades ago would suggest.  Scientists admit they are unsure exactly what lies behind this trend but say it could be that men have become better at looking after themselves.  For example, better heart and brain health - with fewer men smoking, less salt used in food, and a greater emphasis on exercise and blood pressure medication may have helped, they say.  They acknowledge it is hard to decipher why the same trends are not apparent in women, but speculate men may be catching up on health gains that women already experience.  Despite this, they warn that other factors - such as rising levels of obesity and diabetes - may reverse this trend in years to come.  Prof Carol Brayne, at the University of Cambridge, and part of the research team, said: "I'm pretty optimistic that it's stabilising, but if we don't further improve health, then we would expect the numbers to go up with further ageing of the population, so it's a sort of cautious optimism."  Scientists say the most important finding is that a rise in dementia is not inevitable and can be fought.  And they call for a better balance of funds so more money is put into prevention in mid-life.  Meanwhile, Dr James Pickett, head of research at the charity Alzheimer's Society, said the research was encouraging.  But he added: "People are living for longer, and with other risk factors such as diabetes and obesity on the rise, there will still be over 200,000 new cases of dementia each year.  "That's still an enormous number of people who require better information and health and social care support."  Other experts point out the way dementia is diagnosed has changed over time and initiatives focusing on spotting the signs of dementia earlier may offset any reductions seen.	health

It had said the responsibility for offering at-risk people the preventive medication - known as Prep - should fall to local authorities instead.  This comment, a few weeks ago, caused outrage from HIV charities.  And, following a legal threat by the National Aids Trust (NAT), NHS England now says it will "carefully consider" its position.  Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a daily pill that can considerably lower a person's chances of catching HIV.  NHS England has now confirmed that its specialised commissioning committee will consider whether or not to put Prep back into the NHS decision-making process.  NHS England has already promised £2m worth of funds to treat about 500 people over the next two years.  NAT chief executive Deborah Gold said: "Prep is one of the most exciting prevention options to emerge since the HIV epidemic began and offers the prospect of real success in combating this virus.  "To deny the proper process to decide whether to commission Prep, when 17 people are being diagnosed with HIV every day, is not only morally wrong but legally wrong also."  Local Government Association spokeswoman Izzi Seccombe said: "We are pleased and encouraged by NHS England's announcement that it will reconsider its decision not to fund the new HIV treatment Prep.  "Councils have invested millions in providing sexual health services since taking over responsibility for public health three years ago, and this treatment could help reduce levels of HIV in the community.  "However, our position has always been that responsibility for funding Prep should lie within the NHS rather than councils.  "We look forward to working with NHS England to find an agreeable way forward that will resolve this issue."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36081336	Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer'	A new type of cancer drug that wakes up the patient's own immune system to fight tumours could be a game changer for tackling aggressive head and neck cancers, say experts.  Trial results coming out of a US cancer conference suggest the treatment works better than standard chemotherapy.  Nivolumab significantly improved the survival odds of patients with these hard-to-treat tumours.  It is already available on the NHS for people with advanced skin cancer.  But experts say more research is needed before offering it routinely to patients with other cancers.  Immunotherapy is seen as one of the most exciting developments in cancer treatments in years.  While it cannot cure every cancer, mounting evidence suggests it can buy some very ill patients valuable time.  The phase-three trial of nivolumab, presented at the American Association of Cancer Research, suggests the drug can extend survival time by months, even when the cancer is advanced and aggressive.  In the trial, 240 patients with head and neck cancer were given nivolumab, while another 121 were given standard chemotherapy.  After a year, 36% of patients treated with nivolumab injections were still alive compared with 17% of those on chemo.  UK trial leader Prof Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said the results were "a potential game changer" for head and neck cancer, "introducing a new drug treatment into our armoury that at last is better than standard chemotherapy".  "Once it has relapsed or spread, head and neck cancer is extremely difficult to treat, with surgery and radiotherapy often impossible," he said.  "So it's very good news for patients that these interim results indicate we now have a new treatment that works, and can significantly extend life."  About 10,000 patients a year in the UK are diagnosed with a head or neck cancer - cancer of the mouth, lips, voice box, throat, nose, sinuses and salivary glands.  Dr Emma King, of Cancer Research UK, said: "These results could have a significant impact for head and neck cancer patients who no longer respond to treatment.  "They also reinforce the important shift that we are seeing towards using immunotherapies for cancer treatment.  "Before Nivolumab can be used routinely to treat head and neck cancer in the UK, it will need to approved by NICE [the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]."	health

The Environmental Audit Committee said efforts to reduce pollution and boost biodiversity had happened "faster" than otherwise would have been the case.  It said membership gave a platform to influence global climate change policy.  But ex-minister Peter Lilley said the MPs had ignored evidence and failed to address the case for deciding issues such as flooding at a national level.  Mr Lilley, who backs EU exit, published a dissenting view arguing the UK could happily negotiate environmental legislation at an intergovernmental level and have a greater say on some international bodies by having its own seat, rather than being represented by the EU.  However, Mr Lilley was overruled by other members of the committee, including its Labour chairwoman Mary Creagh, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Conservatives Peter Aldous and Peter Heaton-Jones.  The committee, the majority of whose members support remaining in the EU, said it hoped its report would "inform debate" on environmental issues ahead of the referendum on EU membership on 23 June.  It noted that the environment did not feature in any of David Cameron's demands in his recent re-negotiation of the UK's membership terms and that the UK was "broadly satisfied" with EU environmental policy.  EU membership had been a "crucial factor" in shaping UK environmental policy over the past 40 years, the committee said, contributing to improved air and water quality standards and better habitat management.  "The UK's membership of the EU has ensured environmental action was taken on a faster timetable and more thoroughly than would otherwise would have been case," it said.  At the same time, the report - which did not study the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy - said the UK had been a "major player" in influencing the direction of environmental policy at an EU level and in designing specific directives and policies.  While some of those who gave evidence to the committee expressed concerns about how laws were drafted and implemented, and the cost to business of compliance, the MPs said none of them had made an "environmental case for leaving the European Union".  "EU environmental laws...mean we bathe on cleaner beaches, drive more fuel-efficient cars and can hold the government to account on air pollution," said Mrs Creagh, a former shadow environment secretary.  "Environmental problems don't respect borders," she added. "When it comes to protecting our natural environment and dealing with global problems like climate change, the overwhelming evidence is that EU membership has improved the UK's approach to the environment and ensured that the UK's environment has been better protected."  Friends of the Earth welcomed the report, saying the UK's environment is "best served working together with European partners".  But Mr Lilley, the former trade secretary who has sat on the committee since last summer, said the report's conclusions were "mutually contradictory" and many of those who gave evidence had "vested interests" because they received EU funding.  The UK, he said, had a strong record on environmental protection before joining the EU in 1973 - highlighting the Clean Air Acts of the 1950s, the Green Belt and the work of conservation bodies such as the National Trust and Campaign for the Protection of Rural England.  "If the EU has been making Britain more environmentally friendly, it is hard to argue that Britain has been making the EU take the lead in the environmentalism globally," he said. "We are either leader of follower, not both."  Rather than giving the UK enhanced leverage internationally, Mr Lilley said EU membership has deprived the UK of direct representation on ICCAT, an inter-governmental fishery organization responsible for the conservation of tunas, and it risked losing its vote on CITES, the body set up to protect wild animals and plants from commercial exploitation.  He claimed that areas of environmental conflict between the UK and EU - such as over levels of carbon emission reductions or the impact of bio-fuels on food production - were not mentioned in the report.  He also questioned why more attention had not been paid to the case for predominately national issues, such as river management, being handled at a UK level and for cross-border matters to be decided by national governments rather than by 28 states.  "Given the success of devolution within the UK, there is every reason to suppose that there is substantial scope for devolving power within the EU back to member states," he said.  The committee took evidence from academics, wildlife and other conservation bodies, farmers' groups and energy and transport companies as well as ministers and officials from the European Commission. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP and London mayoral candidate who opposes EU membership, was not present when the report was approved last month.	politics

Labour's ruling National Executive Committee rejected its application to set up a stand at the annual gathering.  The decision, which is thought to have cost the party £30,000 in sponsorship money, was criticised as "snobby" by one Labour MP.  A Labour spokeswoman said: "We do not comment on commercial decisions."  A McDonald's spokesman said: "We are disappointed with the decision that has been taken."  The company had reportedly wanted to mount an "interactive experience" display in support of British farm produce and is planning to rent space at the Conservative and SNP conferences.  Former Labour minister Ian Austin tweeted: "Why has @UKLabour turned down £30k from McDonald's? My first job was in their branch of Dudley High Street."  Labour MP Wes Streeting told the Sun on Sunday: "I'm exasperated that we should throw away £30,000 worth of sponsorship like this.  "It smacks of a snobby attitude towards fast-food restaurants and people who work or eat at them."  Hiring out exhibition space to charities and companies is a major source of income for Britain's political parties.

They feel the symptoms are not socially acceptable and may embarrass those close to them, Parkinson's UK said.  It added it was concerned that too many people were struggling alone with their diagnosis, affecting emotional health.  The disease affects 127,000 people in the UK - about one in 500 people.  The main symptoms are tremor, slowness of movement and rigidity.  The charity surveyed 1,868 people with the disease to find out how they dealt with their diagnosis.  One in three with the condition said they had delayed telling friends and family about their diagnosis with some of the main reasons including the fear of being stigmatised.  The charity said the findings also revealed a worrying level of emotional repercussions for people diagnosed with Parkinson's.  Younger people reported being hardest hit by the diagnosis to the extent that many said they felt "like their world had ended" and said "they didn't know who to turn to".  Steve Ford, chief executive at Parkinson's UK, said not getting help for the degenerative neurological condition was having a devastating impact on people's emotional health.  "We are determined that each and every person with Parkinson's is aware of the support available so they can feel equipped to have these difficult conversations.  "We know that the right support, whether through family, friends or Parkinson's UK, is vital for those with the condition, to help them come to terms with their diagnosis and know that they're not alone."  He added: "We are here to help people find the support they need, when they need it."	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36055507	Vaccine switched in 'milestone' towards ending polio	More than 150 countries have begun switching to a different polio vaccine - an important milestone towards polio eradication, health campaigners say.  The new vaccine will target the two remaining strains of the virus under a switchover 18 months in the planning.  There were just 74 cases of the paralysing disease in 2015 and there have been 10 so far this year.  All of the cases were in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Africa has been free of polio for more than a year.  Switching the vaccine from one successfully used to fight polio for more than 30 years is a huge logistical exercise.  Thousands of people will monitor the changeover in 155 countries during the next fortnight.  It is taking effect mainly in developing countries, but also in richer ones such as Russia and Mexico.  The new vaccine will still be given as drops in the mouth, so healthcare workers will not need fresh training.  It will no longer include a weakened version of type 2 polio virus, which was eradicated in 1999.  Dr Stephen Cochi, from the US-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said: "The current vaccine contains live weakened virus relating to three types of polio.  "But we don't need the type 2 component, as it's not in the world any longer.  "And in very rare cases it can mutate and lead to polio, through what's called circulating vaccine-derived virus.  "So removing type 2 from the vaccine takes away that risk - and ensures we have a vaccine which will work better dose by dose."  The planning involved in the switchover has included dealing with a global stockpile of 100 million doses of vaccine targeting just type 2, built up as an insurance policy in case of any outbreak.  The World Health Organization denied some media reports that "millions" of doses of the old vaccine would need to be destroyed, by incineration or other approved means.  Its director of polio eradication, Michel Zaffran, said: "Some will need to be destroyed - but this will be a few vials, not trucks full of vaccine.  "This has been carefully planned because of the huge amount of resources, so countries have been using up the old vaccine, to minimise leftover quantities.  "We're closer than ever to ending polio worldwide, which is why we are able to move forward with the largest and fastest globally synchronised vaccine switchover."  Mike Ray, who contracted polio when he was six years old and has been affected for decades afterwards, told BBC Breakfast he was "absolutely delighted" at the latest news.  He said he was "exceedingly lucky" that he had never had calipers and has been able to get around using crutches and walking sticks.  "I'm not happy it's taken this long [to get close to eradicating the disease] because it has affected so many other people but more power to their elbow. [It is] great news."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36065314	Super-gonorrhoea's spread 'causing huge concern'	Doctors have expressed "huge concern" that super-gonorrhoea has spread widely across England and to gay men.  The new superbug prompted a national alert last year when it emerged in Leeds, as one of the main treatments had become useless against it.  Public Health England acknowledges measures to contain the outbreak have been of "limited success".  Doctors fear the sexually transmitted infection, which can cause infertility, could soon become untreatable.  Cases of super-gonorrhoea have now been detected in the West Midlands, London and southern England.  Only 34 cases have been officially confirmed in laboratory testing, but this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg of an infection that can be symptomless.  The outbreak started in straight couples, but is now being seen in gay men too.  "We've been worried it would spread to men who have sex with men," Peter Greenhouse, a consultant in sexual health based in Bristol, told BBC News.  "The problem is [they] tend to spread infections a lot faster simply as they change partners more quickly."  They are also more likely to have gonorrhoea in their throats. There further resistance is more likely to develop as antibiotics get to the throat in lower doses and the area is also teeming with other bacteria that can share the resistance to drugs.  The bacterium that causes gonorrhoea is extremely adept at shrugging off our best antibiotics.  So two drugs - azithromycin and ceftriaxone - are used in combination.  But now resistance to azithromycin is spreading, doctors fear it is only a matter of time before ceftriaxone fails too.  The disease is caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.  Of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms.  But symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.  Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.  England's most senior doctor has already warned gonorrhoea is on the cusp of becoming untreatable.  And Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head of the sexually transmitted infections unit at Public Health England, said: "We cannot afford to be complacent.  "If strains of gonorrhoea emerge that are resistant to both azithromycin and ceftriaxone, treatment options would be limited as there is currently no new antibiotic available to treat the infection."  She is encouraging people to practise safe sex to minimise the risk of sexually transmitted infections.  There is also a concerted campaign to find the sexual partners of people who have the superbug.  But a Public Health England report acknowledges this has been of "limited success" so far.  Of 50 sexual partners reported, only 22 were successfully followed up, but, worryingly, 94% of partners tested had the infection.  The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said there needed to be a rapid response to the infection and has warned its members to be on the lookout.  Its president, Dr Elizabeth Carlin, said: "The spread of high level azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea is a huge concern and it is essential that every effort is made to contain further spread.  "Failure to respond appropriately will jeopardise our ability to treat gonorrhoea effectively and will lead to poorer health outcomes for individuals and society as a whole."  But Mr Greenhouse warned that sexual health services were facing their "biggest restriction ever" due to funding cuts.  The emergence of a dangerous superbug was creating a "perfect storm scenario", he said.  Meanwhile, the Department of Health has announced a new tool to help GPs cut the number of antibiotics they prescribe.  It will allow practices to see how their antibiotic prescribing habits compare with other practices.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "I want to see antibiotics being prescribed only when necessary and hope this will be a new weapon to help GPs cut the numbers of antibiotics needlessly being given out."	health

Medicines regulator NICE has recommended that Translarna can be used for some children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  However, it will only be given to those who can still walk.  Leo Le Gal, from Ivybridge, lost the use of his legs two years ago - shortly before he began testing the drug.  The uncertainty over his future follows an announcement by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence that Translarna - also known as ataluren - will only be made available to about 50 children in the UK under a "managed access agreement" between the manufacturer, PTC Therapeutics and NHS England.  Those aged five years and over and who can still walk will be given the drug for five years while further data is collected on its efficiency.  Leo, who was diagnosed with DMD five years ago, has been taking part in a three-year international clinical trial at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.  For the first year of the trial - when he could still walk - Leo was taking a placebo and was only transferred to Translarna after he lost the use of his legs.  A placebo is an inactive substance with no medicinal benefits used in trials to determine the effectiveness of a medicinal drug.  Leo's mother, Ruth Le Gal, said while it was "fantastic news" that a drug which could help DMD children would be funded by the NHS, her son's future was uncertain.  "It's great for all those children that will be eligible but sadly Leo won't because, unfortunately he lost the ability to walk before he was able to start taking the medicine," she told BBC News.  Despite not been able to help Leo's legs, his mother said Translarna has stabilised his condition and has been very beneficial.  "He's done really, really well and the medication has maintained his core strength, so he's still got good use of his arms" she said.  Leo's clinical trial is due to finish in six weeks.  "We have no idea what will happen after that," she said, adding that her hope is the trial will be extended.	health

Internet providers are not in breach of current guidelines, even if only 10% of customers can obtain their fastest advertised speed, the group said.  The British Infrastructure Group is calling for greater powers to enable consumers to hold providers to account.  The Advertising Standards Authority said it was aware of concerns about speeds and would consider further work.  "Our position on broadband speed claims in ads is based on extensive work undertaken in recent years, including a full public consultation on new guidance," it said in a statement.  The report from the infrastructure group, which was set up by former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, said consumers had "very few rights and protections" they can turn to if they are "poorly treated" by their internet service provider.  "Consumers must be given the power to hold their internet service provider to account when they let them down or outright mislead them into signing a contract that makes promises that bear no resemblance to the later reality," its report said.  "BIG will therefore be campaigning for mandatory refunds for anyone who has been mis-sold a broadband contract.  "Consumers also need the power to leave contracts if they are found to have been misled."  The group highlighted that there was no minimum level of compensation if customers received a poor service.  "Other industries, such as airlines and banks, are forced to compensate customers for errors, delays and poor practice, so why not broadband?" the report said.  Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 5 live: "You might sign up for 24 megabits of download speed, find that you don't get anywhere near that, you can't get any compensation, you can't get out of the contract, and it seems to us this is completely the wrong way round."  Ofcom has asked fixed-line internet service providers to sign up to a voluntary code of practice, which requires them to provide consumers with more information and advice on maximum broadband speeds.  But the infrastructure group said regulators needed greater powers to step in and "take real robust action" against providers found to be misleading customers.	politics

Scientists at the University of Tokyo are working on ways to display numbers and letters on the skin for health monitoring purposes.  Wearable electronics are a future growth area in research, with interest in medical applications such as contact lenses that monitor glucose levels, or smart glasses.

Debbie Evans is a mother who feels using the law is her last resort.  Her 24-year-old son Eden has been in institutions for seven years.  Over a period of five years his weight increased by 16 stone (101kg).  "He would say to me, 'You've got to get me out Mummy, you've got to get me out,'" she said.  Mrs Evans found it difficult to support her son, who has autism and a learning disability, when he lived at home in west London.  She said he had no formal education from the age of eight because there was no proper provision for him.  "It got really hard with him when he was 14; he hadn't had any education and basically he lashed out at me," she said.  "It got to the point that I couldn't breathe - it was 24 hours a day seven days a week."  She sought help and he ended up in an assessment and treatment unit.  These are meant to be short stay hospitals where patients are given a plan of care to support them back into the community, but this did not happen in Eden's case.  "He's been trapped for seven long years," Debbie said.  Emma Jones is a human rights lawyer from Leigh Day solicitors representing about five families living in England.  She believes they have a case to be answered and is exploring avenues for legal action to be taken under the Care Act, the Children's Act and the Human Rights Act.  She said: "In a nutshell, the position we are facing in this country is that there aren't enough community provisions being provided which means that people who no longer meet the criteria to be detained remain locked up because [there is] nowhere else for them to go.  "If they're locked up when they shouldn't be locked up they are detained unlawfully and that's a breach of their human rights."  Since the Winterbourne View scandal in 2011, when an undercover Panorama investigation revealed abuse of people with learning disabilities, there has been debate as to the best way to support some of the most vulnerable people in society.  Numerous reports have been published and NHS England has responded with what is described as a "far reaching" plan.  The aim is to reduce the number of people in institutional care by up to 50% over the next three years by building up the level of support in the community.  There are more than 2,500 people with learning disabilities and autism kept in institutions across England.  According to the latest Learning Disability Census, nearly a third have care plans that clearly state there is no reason for them to receive inpatient care.  A spokesperson for NHS England said: "Every case is different and patients' needs are often extremely complex, but we have been clear that hospitals should not be seen as homes.  "Where admission is deemed by clinicians to be in their best interest, patients should stay no longer than they need to.  "From this month, local areas will begin implementing a plan to ensure that the housing, care and advocacy services become available in each community to provide the high-quality alternatives to hospitals."  The families of those still in the system say that every minute, every hour is valuable and things have so far, moved far too slowly.  A social media campaign is due to launch on Monday called "Seven Days of Action".  Each day will see the release of a new story of someone's son, brother, sister or daughter far away from their families.  They are doing it, they say, to put a face to the numbers.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36056759	Green light for Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug	A drug for treating children aged five and over with Duchenne muscular dystrophy will be available for around 50 youngsters through NHS England.  The medicines regulator NICE has recommended that Translarna (also known as ataluren) be used to help children who will receive the most benefit.  The drug has the potential to delay the loss of the ability to walk in children with the muscle-wasting disease.  Families and charities say they are delighted by the decision.  NICE - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - has announced that Translarna should be made available under a "managed access agreement" between the company who makes it, PTC Therapeutics, and NHS England.  This means that it can only be used to treat a small group of certain children - those with Duchenne caused by a particular mutation who are aged five years and over and who are still able to walk.  They will be treated for five years, allowing the company time to collect further data on the drug's efficiency.  The company will now have to agree a cost for the drug which is acceptable to NHS England. Its list price is around £220,000 per year.  NICE decided to recommend Translarna because there have been promising signs that it could delay the loss of walking for up to seven years.  In a recent clinical trial, none of the 47 children taking the drug lost the ability to walk over a period of nearly a year, compared with 8% of children on a placebo.  Children with the progressive disease typically become dependent on a wheelchair by the age of 12.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive disease linked to the X-chromosome, affecting mostly boys.  There are 60 to 70 children born with the disease in England each year and around six to nine of them are affected by the "nonsense" mutation relevant to this drug.  Translarna works by allowing the body to ignore the mutation in the DNA and continue to produce the protein dystrophin, which protects the muscles from wasting.  The charity Muscular Dystrophy UK has been fighting for the drug to be made available on the NHS for some time.  Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of Muscular Dystrophy UK, said the announcement was "wonderful news and a true victory for the families".  And he said the agreement would allow them "to gain a clearer picture of the full potential of Translarna, and, crucially, to buy precious time for other promising potential treatments to reach licensing stage. It is a chance to transform childhoods".  However he said he was concerned that it could take months for NHS England to implement the agreement and get the drug to clinic, having already waited 18 months for the decision.  He said: "We call on NHS England to act with the urgency and resolve that these children and their families deserve."  Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said the decision had been considered carefully because of the costs involved.  "NICE acknowledges that it represents a significant cost to the NHS at a time of increased pressure on funding and has considered this carefully against the uncertainties of its potential long-term benefits.  "This is why the committee has recommended the drug be made available for an initial period of five years, under strict conditions, to allow more data to be gathered on its efficacy, before the guidance is reviewed and a further decision made on whether funding should be continued."  Dr Peter Jackson, chair of the NICE highly specialised technologies evaluation committee, said the next five years would be crucial.  "The committee could not have recommended the drug without the agreement to limit its use to five years while more data is gathered.  "If the data shows that the drug is less effective in the longer term and doesn't provide good value, the NHS is not committed to funding the drug in the long-term."  Final guidance from NICE on Translarna will be published towards the end of May 2016 and NHS England then has three months to make it available to its patients.  Recently, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) denied automatic access to the drug through the NHS in Scotland.  In 2014, Translarna became the first drug addressing a genetic cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to be approved in the EU.  It has been available to families in a number of European countries for over a year.	health

The former home secretary told the BBC it was a decision taken to allow people to work legally - not a "failure".  At the time, Labour ministers said 13,000 migrants a year would come - but that proved to be a huge underestimate.  Blunkett's predecessor as Labour home secretary Jack Straw has described the policy as a "spectacular mistake".  Unlike France and Germany, which did not give migrants from the eight countries which joined the EU in May 2004 full access to their labour market until 2011, the then Labour government did not insist on any transitional controls.  Asked whether he regretted the failure to do so, Mr Blunkett told Radio 4's PM programme: "No, I don't. It was a decision, it wasn't a failure.  "It was a decision to allow people to work legally, openly, transparently, to pay taxes and national insurance and the numbers coming in openly, legally and working are a fraction of those who Germany have taken because they are refugees."  He said the failure was not to "put in place the mechanisms to absorb and to support those people coming in and to support the communities who were hosting them - not the decision to be open and transparent about it".  He added that he did not believe the policy was ultimately responsible for stoking Euroscepticism in the UK.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of pressure group Migration Watch UK said: "It is surprising that Lord Blunkett has no regrets about one of the most serious blunders committed by his government.  "They based themselves on a report that predicted a maximum of 13,000 net migration a year.  "We said at the time that this prediction was 'almost worthless'.  "In the event the population of East Europeans increased by nearly a million in the following ten years.  "This had a huge impact on public services and housing in many communities, for which the government failed to provide."  Only the UK, Ireland and Sweden fully opened their borders to nationals of the eight states that joined the EU in May 2004, which included Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  At the time the government quoted research suggesting the move would increase the UK population by 13,000 a year - although the author of that report has since said it was misinterpreted. More than 400,000 work permits were approved by June 2006.  Then Home Office Minister Beverley Hughes told MPs in 2003: "The number coming here for employment will be minimal."  Jack Straw, Mr Blunkett's predecessor as home secretary, has since described the policy as a "spectacular mistake".  He said handing immediate working rights to Poles and others when they joined the EU nine years ago was a "well-intentioned policy we messed up".  Office for National Statistics data suggests that there were 76,000 arrivals to the UK from the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004 in the year to December 2005, 92,000 the following year and 112,000 the year after.  Figures from the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory suggests "net flow" of EU nationals - taking into account people leaving and and arriving in the UK - shot up from 15,000 in 2003 to 87,000 in 2004 and continued to rise until 2007 when it reached 127,000 a year.	politics

Andrew Walker wants action taken after an inquest into the death of a newborn.  Kristian Jaworski died five days after his birth in June 2015 as a result of brain damage during a "prolonged and extended instrumental delivery".  North Middlesex University Hospital has accepted liability for his death, but said cost had not been a consideration.  Mr Walker's report, sent to the Department of Health, says that in the case of Kristian Jaworski there appeared to be a financial reason for favouring a vaginal delivery "that needed to be rebutted".  The coroner described how Tracey Taylor, Kristian's mother, repeatedly told medical staff that she needed a caesarean after complications during the birth of her first child Sebastian, three-and-a-half years earlier.  She told the inquest that doctors had informed her at that time that she had a "narrow birth canal" and would need a caesarean section if she ever had another child.  But the information was never recorded in her medical notes and she said her requests for a caesarean during a lengthy and difficult labour were ignored.  The inquest heard that doctors tried repeatedly to deliver Kristian in theatre using suction and then forceps, before performing an emergency caesarean under general anaesthetic.  But when he was born, Kristian had already been starved of oxygen and suffered severe brain damage from which he never recovered.  His mother Tracey Taylor told the Today programme why she wanted to tell her story.  "I don't want anyone else to go through the same thing. I feel that I was treated like an over-anxious woman who was too frightened to give birth.  "I went in there with a reason which is something that a woman wouldn't just make up. I was told I had a narrow birth canal."  North Middlesex University Hospital's director of medicine, Dr Cathy Cale, said: "We are very sorry for the tragic death of baby Kristian. The team of doctors and midwives were deeply affected and both they and the hospital trust have expressed sincere apologies to the family.  "Although the coroner did not find the trust negligent, we have accepted liability for Kristian's death because we accept we made mistakes.  "As a result of our own detailed investigation, we have drawn up new guidance for all our staff about limiting prolonged instrumental delivery and avoiding the sequential use of instruments."  Dr Cale said that the hospital had taken steps to ensure that if a mother expresses concerns about her means of delivery, the reasons for them are clearly recorded in her notes.  But she said doctors and midwives always had to weigh up competing risks.  "It is usually safer and better for women to give birth naturally rather than to have a caesarean, because every surgical procedure carries risks of its own, including haemorrhage, injury to the mother's bladder and infection.  "Our team took their decision to continue with the natural delivery in this case for clinical reasons alone and would have had no concerns about intervening surgically had they believed this risk was warranted. There was and never is any question of cost being a consideration."  According to the Department of Health, the average cost of all vaginal deliveries (including normal and assisted deliveries) is calculated to be £1,985, while the average cost of all caesareans (planned and emergency) is £3,781.  The latest figures from NICE, The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, suggest that a planned caesarean costs £2,369 and an emergency caesarean costs £3,042, while planned vaginal births cost £1,665.  The Department of Health now has 56 days to respond to the coroner's report.  In the meantime, Health Minister Ben Gummer said his deepest sympathies lay with Kristian's family, who had "been let down terribly".  "Treatment decisions in maternity care should always be made by clinicians in full consultation with women. These should be based on a woman's individual clinical needs and in line with NICE guidelines in terms of best practice."  He added: "It is vital that we learn from tragedies like this to ensure they are not repeated and far fewer families have to experience this kind of heartache."  Elizabeth Prochaska, barrister and chair of Birthrights, a charity which fights to improve women's experience of pregnancy, said the case was a tragic reminder that medical professionals do not always listen to women.  "When a woman requests a caesarean she is asking for the care she has decided is safest for her and her baby. We must trust women to make that decision. Hospital policies which refuse to honour women's decisions ultimately make birth less safe for women and babies."  Have you been affected by the issues raised in this article?

Plenty of Conservatives doubt it, despite the plan being announced at the Budget. This is what's going on.  First Conservative councillors complained. Then Tory MPs spoke out - not anonymously briefing journalists but laying into the policy in the House of Commons. In a remarkable debate, normally loyal Tories attacked one after another, including some parliamentary aides who are supposed to toe the line.  One - Steve Brine, who works for the health secretary Jeremy Hunt - told BBC Radio 4's Today there was "great concern" among Tories and the government needed a "way out". Labour are doing everything they can to turn opposition into rebellion.  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is set to make a public commitment the plan won't result in school closures. She has written to every Conservative MP to say six years will be enough time for schools to make plans. Schools minister Nick Gibb has been trying to change minds in the Commons tearoom. They're arguing academies are simply better for pupils, parents and teachers.  There won't be a chance to kill the plan for a while. When Labour prompted a debate on this, the government motion managed to avoid spelling out the policy, so MPs didn't have to back it. It's not yet written into a bill.  And when - perhaps if - they do vote on it there's every chance rules to give English MPs a greater say on laws that only affect England will help the government. But sceptical Tory MPs are watching carefully to see whether this features in the Queen's Speech setting out the government's plan for new laws. If it doesn't, they'll be certain a climbdown is coming.  Teachers, parents and councillors concerned about the plan are doing a good job of rattling MPs, who are keenly aware of how it is going down in their constituencies.  Tories back the idea of academies, and of creating more academies, but plenty don't see why good schools have to be forced to convert to this timescale. They are also worried about a proposed change that means parent governors would no longer be required.  This was the headline announcement on the morning of the Budget. Having abandoned plans to cut disability benefit, dumping it would damage not only Education Secretary Nicky Morgan but her old boss at the Treasury George Osborne too.	politics

Scientists advised patients to use the drugs, known as proton pump inhibitors, only when medically necessary and not for too long.  The medicines suppress acid production in the stomach and are used to treat heartburn and ulcers.  Five proton pump inhibitors are licensed for use in the UK which treat millions of people each year.  Omeprazole and pantoprazole can be bought over the counter at pharmacies.  Researchers in the US analysed information on more than 170,000 people taking proton pump inhibitors and 20,000 people taking an alternative class of drugs also used to suppress stomach acid.  Over a period of five years, those taking proton pump inhibitors had a 28% increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and a 96% greater risk of suffering kidney failure, according to the study, published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.  Patients who took proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for longer periods of time were more likely to experience kidney problems.  Lead scientist Dr Ziyad Al-Aly, from the VA Saint Louis Health Care System in the US, said: "The results emphasise the importance of limiting PPI use to only when it is medically necessary, and also limiting the duration of use to the shortest possible.  "A lot of patients start taking PPIs for a medical condition, and they continue much longer than necessary."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36049907	Gene editing 'boosts' cancer-killing cells	Cancer scientists have genetically modified the immune system to help it attack tumours in mice.  The immune system is the body's own defence against infection and cancer, but tumours develop ways of stopping the onslaught.  The University College London team manipulated the DNA of immune cells to allow them to keep up the fight.  Experts said the idea needed to be tested in human trials, but it was still exciting.  Harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer is one of the most exciting fields in medicine.  A lot of the research is targeted at the "chemical handshake" that tumours use to disable immune cells.  A class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, interrupt the handshake and are already available for patients.  This has lead to spectacular results for some patients, but it can lead to side-effects as the drugs affect the whole immune system.  The approach now being tried effectively cuts off one of the hands - known technically as PD-1 - to prevent the handshake, but is targeted only at those immune cells attacking the cancer.  In experiments on mice, scientists extracted killer T cells - which gobble up cancerous tissue - from inside the tumour. The assumption is the immune cells clustering inside the tumour are trained to attack it.  Cutting edge gene editing technology was then used to change the DNA - the code of life - inside the killer T cells so that PD-1 was removed and cancers would be unable to stop them.  It is known colloquially as "cutting the brakes".  In experiments on melanoma and fibrosarcoma, mouse survival increased from less than 20% after 60 days without treatment to more than 70% with treatment.  Dr Sergio Quezada, one of the researchers, said: "This is an exciting discovery and means we may have a way to get around cancer's defences while only targeting the immune cells that recognise the cancer.  "While drugs that block PD-1 do show promise, this method only knocks out PD-1 on the T cells that can find the tumour - which could mean fewer side effects for patients."  Dr Alan Worsley, from Cancer Research UK which funded the study, said: "I think it's actually pretty exciting - it's elegant, simple, straightforward and it makes sense.  "We're going to see how this works in trials, but potentially it gets around the side effects."  He said in immunotherapy drug trials "so many people had to come off because of the side effects, here it's not your whole immune system going crazy it's just those in the tumour."	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36043876	Malaria resistance 'unable to spread'	The first case of the malaria parasite being unable to spread its resistance to drugs has been discovered by scientists in Australia.  Tests showed the parasite can learn to shrug off the effects of the drug atovaquone, but in doing so it cripples a later part of its life cycle.  The team at the University of Melbourne hope the "genetic trap" will lead to new ways of curbing malaria.  They are aiming to perform field tests in Kenya and Zambia.  Atovaquone was introduced in 2000, but it became less popular when resistance was almost immediately detected.  The concern with resistance is that it spreads and eventually the drug becomes unusable as it can no longer kill the malaria parasite.  The researchers followed the full and complex life cycle of the malaria parasite in both animals and mosquitoes.  In initial tests on mice, published in the journal Science, they confirmed what had long been known - that resistance to the drug can emerge.  However, the parasite has to change in order to become resistant and the study showed it altered the way it releases energy from food.  This helped the parasite survive the chemical onslaught in the mouse's bloodstream where there is a free and easy supply of sugar.  But it is harder for the parasite inside a mosquito and it had lost something vital for life in those more hostile conditions.  So despite resistance emerging in one host species, it was unable to survive in the other.  In 44 attempts to spread a resistant parasite from one mouse to another, involving 750 mosquito bites, it was successful only once. And that resistance was unable to spread any further.  Prof Geoff McFadden, one of the researchers, told the BBC: "I think it could be really big, it could really change the way we use this drug."  He added: "The development of drug resistance may not be a major problem if the resistance cannot spread, meaning the drug atovaquone could be more widely used in malaria control.  "We now understand the particular genetic mutation that gave rise to drug resistance in some malaria parasite populations and how it eventually kills them in the mosquito, providing new targets for the development of drugs."  Experiments with the human malarial parasite showed similar findings, but the researchers now want to test it in the field.  About half of the world's population, around 3.2 billion people, are at risk of the disease. It kills around 440,000 people each year.  Commenting on the findings, Prof David Conway from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: "Any resistant parasites that arise in a person taking the drug cannot be transmitted to other people, so resistance should always remain very rare.  "This drug is normally used in a co-formulated tablet with an unrelated drug called proguanil to prevent and treat malaria, but it is expensive and normally only used by travellers from wealthy countries.  "Other antimalarial drugs are the mainstay for prevention and treatment throughout the world and resistance to most of these is spreading, as the parasite gene mutations involved do not prevent transmission."	health

Labour's Rupa Huq criticised Citizen Khan's depiction of a "quite backward" family of Muslims.  The show was accused of stereotyping Muslims when it started in 2012 and its creator, Adil Ray, has told the Radio Times he had received death threats.  The BBC said the award-winning show had received much positive feedback.  But Ms Huq, MP for Ealing Central and Acton, whose sister Konnie is a former Blue Peter presenter, said: "I feel as if I didn't know what the year is ... you would think it's an everyday tale of a Birmingham family of Muslims but they're really quite backward.  "Again, the Islamophobic point [Labour MP Chuka Umunna] made, it's a beardy weirdy chap and they're not quite cutting off people's hands but I can imagine that being in a future episode."  Citizen Khan prompted complaints when it launched in 2012 and Mr Ray has previously said he had received abuse from people who believed it was making fun of Islam or stereotyping Muslims.  But the show has won various awards at the Royal Television Society and Asian Media Awards.  A BBC spokesman said: "The fact that Citizen Khan returns for its fifth series this year is a sign of its popularity with all audiences - indeed the show has won several awards, including Best TV character at the Asian Media Awards.  "We've also had positive comments from members of the Muslim community for the show and for creator Adil Ray who, like the family portrayed, is a British Pakistani Muslim. As with all sitcoms the characters are comic creations and not meant to be representative of the community as a whole."  Ms Huq made her comments during a backbench debate called by former culture minister David Lammy.  Mr Lammy accused the BBC of hiring "the same old faces from the same old schools to the same old jobs" and said he had been contacted by black and Asian BBC staff who said "that they cannot speak up because they do not want to be labelled a troublemaker".  He also said the Chinese community was "totally invisible" on the broadcaster and said the BBC's new charter must address the lack of progress in boosting ethnic minority representation.  He said although the BBC ran 29 schemes aimed at ethnic minorities between 1999 and 2014, the situation was not improving and the proportion of ethnic minority staff had dropped from 13.1% in 2015 to 12.2% now.  The Labour MP for Tottenham praised the diversity of children's television, BBC Three and documentaries but questioned whether there was sufficient diversity in management.  He said: "We all go into Broadcasting House and see the security, see black staff at the junior ends, but walk into that newsroom, think about the editorial decisions that are being made, and ask yourself, is that really representative of our country as a whole?"  Conservative MP Helen Grant suggested the BBC could voluntarily disclose data on the recruitment, retention, promotion and pay of staff from ethnic minorities.  Labour Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said the BBC should reflect every region in the UK, adding that Salford - where the BBC's MediaCity UK is based - was "not where the North ends".  Earlier, Mr Umunna attacked the "representation of our Muslim communities" on TV.  He said "rising Islamophobia" could partly be blamed on broadcasters' use of "community leaders who purport to speak for that community but have no mandate whatsoever to do so".  The BBC said it was "making good progress" on becoming more diverse but said it would continue to develop "new and innovative ideas to do even better" and would soon be setting out its new diversity strategy.  "Almost half of our workforce is made up of women and the proportion of our workforce who are black, Asian and other ethnic minority is at an all-time high," the spokesman added.	politics

The Commons Public Administration Committee said it was concerned Peter Riddell, formerly of the Times, had the right experience for the job.  It also fears he may not get the powers he needs to prevent cronyism.  The man he replaces as commissioner for public appointments, Sir David Normington, welcomed him to the role.  "I know Peter to be a person of integrity and independence who will want to ensure that public appointments are made on merit," said the former top civil servant.  But he added: "I fear he may have his work cut out."  Sir David told The Financial Times government ministers, including David Cameron, had been pushing for Conservative donors and ex-MPs to be given key jobs at the head of public sector organisations since the general election.  And he warned that plans to change the way public appointments, such as directors of the Bank of England or the board of regulators like Ofcom, are made could see "a return to the days of political and personal patronage".  Mr Riddell, a former head of the Institute for Government think tank, was last month quizzed about his suitability for his new role by the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC).  In a report, the committee said it endorsed his appointment, but added that "this endorsement is not unqualified", saying it planned to be a "critical friend" to the new commissioner.  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, said: "While there was no formal objection recorded to his appointment, some members of PACAC expressed their concern that Mr Riddell lacks experience of working in a large organisation, or in a regulated environment, or in making or supervising major appointments."  These concerns were "amplified" by plans to reduce the powers of the commissioner to directly influence recruitment decisions, added Mr Jenkin.  The Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned planned changes to the system, proposed by the businessman Sir Gerry Grimstone, would lead to the "politicization" of major public appointments.  The Grimstone proposals would allow ministers to choose a candidate who the interview panel had deemed "below the line of appointability", although the decision would have to be justified publicly, or ditch the formal recruitment process altogether to secure a specific candidate.  The government says the planned changes will increase transparency and accountability and will include strong safeguards.	politics

UKIP donor Arron Banks reacted angrily to news that the group he was backing had not been selected, claiming the decision was "corrupt".  But he said he had decided not to seek a judicial review after talking to UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  Mr Farage has said he will campaign with any group that wants an EU exit.  Mr Banks' Leave.EU group was affiliated to Grassroots Out (GO), the group that lost out to Vote Leave.  Announcing its decision on Wednesday, the Electoral Commission said Vote Leave had "better demonstrated that it has the structures in place to ensure the views of other campaigners are represented in the delivery of its campaign"  "It therefore represents, to a greater extent than 'Go Movement Ltd', those campaigning for the 'Leave' outcome, which is the test we must apply," it added.  Mr Banks signalled his intention to launch a legal challenge immediately after the news that Vote Leave had won the official designation, and said it could delay the referendum - taking place on 23 June - until October.  After consulting lawyers, he said: "What is clear now is that if we were to pursue a judicial review, according to legal experts, we would win."  But explaining the group's change of heart, he added: "But this is a time to take a step back from the matter, and after consulting with leading campaigners on this issue, including UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage - we have decided to show the public how this process was stitched up, but not to pursue the judicial review any further."  He said it was time to "turn our collective guns on the real opponents" in the referendum campaign - those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.  "We will be pursuing this campaign with vigour - and we'll have some fun with it along the way," he said.  Britain Stronger In Europe, led by former Marks and Spencer boss Lord Rose, is the lead campaign for the Remain side.	politics

John Penrose said the report's author, Sir John Chilcot, would understand the frustration at how long it was taking.  Conservative MP David Davis said the delay could cost lives as subsequent deployment decisions are taken without the lessons learned from Iraq.  Sir John set himself a deadline of next week to finish writing the report.  The inquiry, which is considering how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, began in 2009 under former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  In October Sir John said the text of the report would be finished on 18 April, at which point national security checking could begin, with a view to publishing in June or July 2016.  Mr Penrose, a minister in the Cabinet Office, told MPs the government was expecting to receive the report next week but that the publication timetable would be controlled by Sir John.  "The government's contribution, which is the national security checking, will be done in two weeks or less, and we will deliver on our pledge," he said.  Mr Penrose said Sir John would "understand the thirst to see the results of his work" and would have "listened to the tone and tenor of this debate".  He also said there was nothing in the rules governing the EU referendum that would mean the report could not be published until after the 23 June poll.  Mr Davis and other MPs called for publication in the first week of May.  The former shadow home secretary said: "The longer we leave it the less useful these lessons will be and the more likely it is that we will make the same mistakes.  "A decision such as those that were made in Libya, Syria and Iraq are made without the knowledge or facts, mistakes are made, and sometimes people die as a result.  "It's not hyperbole to say delay to the Iraq Inquiry could cost lives because bad decisions could be made - I would go further, I'd say it probably did cost lives because bad decisions were made."  Downing Street said the prime minister wanted the report to be published "as soon as possible".  Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said once it was completed the process of national security checking could begin, then it needed to be proofread - "so that may take some time".  In his October letter to the prime minister, Sir John said security checking was "normal and necessary" with inquiries handling large amounts of sensitive material.  "I consider that once national security checking has been completed it should be possible to agree a date for publication in June or July 2016," he added.	politics

The latest batch of monthly figures from the NHS in England suggest a service that's struggling to keep up with demand.  Once again, many of the main performance targets - including ambulance response times, delays in A&E, and treatment for cancer - have been missed  All this against a background of increased attendances, more referrals and GPs being busier than ever  So is the NHS is stuck in a never-ending cycle of soaring demand?  The kitchen at Stanborough Lodge care home in Welwyn Garden City is part of the NHS frontline in the fight to ease the strain on hospitals.  The health service has funded training for staff at more than 20 homes in the area in skills such as nutrition and dementia care, and that has affected day-to-day activities such as encouraging residents to help prepare healthy food.  It is one of 50 schemes across England under the "Vanguard" programme - to improve care and highlight ways of working efficiently. There is close support from a GP linked to the home, and a pharmacist, Puja Vyas, who has tackled unnecessary medication.  She said: "They'll be on seven or eight medicines. The most I've seen is 16. There's a lot of things that could have been stopped years ago.  "I've got the time and expertise to go through the medicines they're taking, and say which ones the patient really needs."  Early results are encouraging. Last month there were no falls. Before the scheme there were about eight a month. Ambulance calls are down more than 30%.  The NHS is pinning a lot on these schemes, which are being trialled in a range of settings.  Nigel Edwards, from health think-tank the Nuffield Trust, says the initial findings from care home vanguards are encouraging, but some other areas have not fared so well.  "There are 400,000 or so people in care homes who constitute a significant amount of activity in emergency and geriatric medicine so that would definitely help.  "But there's also a big demand from younger patients and patients living at home. That's been harder to deal with."  So what is fuelling demand on the NHS? As well as a growing and ageing population, Nigel Edwards points to changing expectations and new treatments for patients who previously would have been beyond help.  Unless the NHS adapts, he says, in the next five years it will need an extra 16,000 beds.  But there is an argument the health service could manage demand comfortably, if it focussed better on patients' real needs.  Hamish Dibley is an independent healthcare consultant who has worked for several health service trusts. All too often, he says, they confuse rising activity with demand - which he argues is stable and predictable.  "We've seen everyone who's going to appear in the urgent care system within the first three months of every financial year, and they keep repeating and boomeranging around year on year, until ultimately they die.  He says this is entirely avoidable, if the system re-directs its efforts on what he calls the "vital few".  Seventy-year-old Anthony Rodwell from Berkshire is a classic example of this group.  Last autumn he was told he should have an operation to remove a wisdom tooth. Then he learned he needed major heart surgery, and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Time and again the heart operation has been put back, and the cancer treatment disrupted, because of delays to the tooth procedure. He has been seen at nine different hospitals, culminating in an emergency admission for his heart.  "It seems appalling to me that you'd have to have so many appointments, speak to so many people, travel so many miles to so many different hospitals, to have different tests done. It just seems a terrible waste of resources to me."  Hamish Dibley says this case shows how a failure to get different parts of the system to pull together for the patient only increases activity.  Nigel Edwards argues the challenge for the NHS is not just to curb admissions: the "bigger win" is in reducing length of stay.  To do that, he says it is vital to invest more in community services and social care so patients can go home promptly. But he is worried.  "The community workforce is ageing. There have been reductions in some areas in numbers of community nurses.  "And I think we're going to have to see the NHS pull its finger out a bit in terms of making those investments."  Whatever differences there may be about why the NHS is so stretched, there is no denying that with money so tight and performance slipping on many fronts, time to find a solution is running out.	health

Hospitals are meant to see 95% of patients in four hours, but just 87.8% were, NHS England data revealed.  That is a slight drop on the January figures, which were the worst since the target was introduced in 2004.  And in another sign of growing A&E pressures, a unit in Lancashire is being forced to close overnight from next week because of a staffing crisis.  Bosses running the Chorley A&E said they had to take the step because they did not have the doctors to staff the unit.  There is a national shortage of A&E doctors and Chorley said this had been exacerbated by the national cap on agency staff which has been brought in.  The cap limits the amount hospitals can pay for locum staff to no more than 55% above normal shift rates. It has been phased in since November as the government has demanded the health service curb the rising bill for agency staff, which has been cited as one of the major factors behind the deficits being racked.  The Chorley unit - part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - tried to apply the cap but found it could not fill its rotas.  It relied heavily on locum staff because it did not have enough permanent doctors and so this month has stopped using the cap, under the emergency clause in the regulations, but still could not find the staff.  There have been suggestions other trusts have got round it by paying permanent doctors extra to fill shifts.  Trust medical director Prof Mark Pugh said: "We simply cannot staff the rotas and it is an unacceptable risk to patient safety to attempt to provide an emergency service with no doctors available to see people."  The news emerged as NHS England published its monthly performance report for February.  As well as the problems in A&E, the 111 phone service, ambulances and cancer care also missed key performance targets.  The 18-week target to see patients needing routine treatments, such as knee and hip operations, was met although a number of trusts did not submit data.  Candace Imison, of the Nuffield Trust, said: "Today's figures are the very visible symptoms of a system facing both inexorably increasing patient numbers and severe financial strain."	health

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, said a "daunting fiscal and demographic crunch" will require tax rises of 18% across the euro area.  Her speech came ahead of the Electoral Commission announcing Vote Leave as the official Out campaign.  Backers of EU exit have been boosted by news that a group of Tory donors is considering giving them up to £5m.  Britain Stronger In Europe has been designated as the lead campaign for the In side.  It and Vote Leave will each have a spending limit of £7m while other groups taking part in the campaign are limited to £700,000 expenditure.  In her speech, Ms Stuart cited research by Vote Leave which the group says shows spending on public pensions across the eurozone is estimated to rise by 2.1% of GDP by 2020, and the cost of debt interest payments to go up from 1.8% to 6.9% of GDP over the next 35 years.  It suggests that tax rises of 17.6% will be needed to plug the gap and that the UK, while outside the euro, will "inevitably" be affected.  "The priorities of the eurozone will gradually and inevitably take over Brussels institutions," Ms Stuart said. "If we don't want to be part of this we must vote Leave."  The government has said it has negotiated safeguards to ensure it will not have to contribute to any future bailouts across the eurozone while the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that a UK exit from the EU could cause "severe economic damage".  The IMF - one of the main pillars of the global economic order - said a so-called Brexit would disrupt established trading relationships and cause "major challenges" for the UK and the rest of Europe.  But Ms Stuart said that her experience, as a former Labour minister, in negotiating the EU's Lisbon Treaty in 2009 exposed her to the EU's "mule-like refusal to listen to democratic concerns" or accept any "deviation from the orthodoxy of political integration".  Democratic accountability and economic competitiveness were "downgraded", said, "in case they become a diversion from the European project". "I call it integration at whatever the cost or consequences," she added.  Grassroots Out - another group campaigning for EU exit - has said it was "delighted" that the Midlands Industrial Council, a wealthy group of Conservative Party donors - are offering to help bankroll the Leave campaign.  The Council, which does not publish its accounts or the names of its supporters, have been one of the Tories' main financial backers, giving up to £2m to the party a year in recent times.  David Wall, its secretary who sits on the board of Grassroots Out, told the Daily Telegraph that the organisation was "incandescent with rage" about the government's decision to spend £9m on sending pro-EU leaflets to every UK household.  He told the paper that it could potentially give up to £5m to the campaign to leave the EU over the next two months.  Britain Stronger in Europe - the official In campaign - has claimed the support of more than 35 FTSE 100 company bosses.  Employers' group the CBI is highlighting the links between UK and European business, arguing EU membership has helped attract £377bn of investment from France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands alone.  "European businesses are clear that 40 years' worth of collaboration through the EU is critical to attracting investment to the UK - let's not turn our back on our closest partners," said the CBI's director general Carolyn Fairbairn.  Meanwhile, the EEF manufacturers' organisation is warning that the UK economy is "heavily reliant" on migrant labour, with EU nationals accounting for 10% of the workforce in the industrial sector "without whom it would not function".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36031743	Labour calls to curb John Whittingdale's powers after escort relationship	Labour has called for Culture Secretary John Whittingdale to withdraw from press regulation decisions after news of his relationship with a sex worker.  Four newspapers knew about the relationship, which ended in 2014, but decided not to publish the story.  Shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle said it had left him "vulnerable" to pressure from the press.  Mr Whittingdale, who says he had not known the woman was a sex worker, said it had not affected his decisions.  Downing Street said Mr Whittingdale was "a single man entitled to a private life" and had the full confidence of the prime minister.  As culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale's job is to regulate newspapers and he is currently overseeing a new regulatory framework under consideration in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.  Ms Eagle said the Conservative minister should "recuse" himself from any further involvement in decisions relating to the inquiry.  Should John Whittingdale have revealed his past?  Who is John Whittingdale and why does the story matter?  Press regulation: What you need to know  Mr Whittingdale told BBC's Newsnight: "Between August 2013 and February 2014, I had a relationship with someone who I first met through Match.com.  "She was a similar age and lived close to me. At no time did she give me any indication of her real occupation and I only discovered this when I was made aware that someone was trying to sell a story about me to tabloid newspapers. As soon as I discovered, I ended the relationship.  "This is an old story which was a bit embarrassing at the time. The events occurred long before I took up my present position and it has never had any influence on the decisions I have made as culture secretary."  At the time of the relationship, Mr Whittingdale was chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee.  He was made culture secretary in May 2015, more than a year after the relationship ended.  Downing Street told Newsnight it was not aware of Mr Whittingdale's relationship before his appointment to the cabinet job.  David Cameron first knew about the story "about ten days ago", a spokesman added.  New ministers routinely sit down with their department's most senior civil servant, the permanent secretary, to talk through anything that might cause a problem.  We don't know whether John Whittingdale told Sue Owen, at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport CMS, about the embarrassing personal story that had been hawked around Fleet Street for over a year.  Given that Downing Street says it only learned about it 10 days ago, if he did say anything, it would seem it was not passed on.  Having ended the relationship 15 months earlier, Mr Whittingdale may argue there was no longer anything that could look like a conflict of interest, nothing that might appear to place him under an improper obligation.  Four newspapers - the People, part of the Mirror Group, the Mail on Sunday, from the Daily Mail group, the Sun, part of News UK, and the now online-only Independent - had investigated the claims against Mr Whittingdale.  They did not publish the story, concluding it was not in the public interest.  Tom Newton-Dunn, the Sun's political editor, told Sky News: "We didn't publish the story because, quite frankly, there is no story.  "He is a single man, a divorced man. You can pretty much have a relationship with anyone you want."  However, James Cusick, a former Independent reporter who looked at the story for five months, said the public had a right to know the story as Mr Whittingdale was making decisions on how newspapers and the BBC could conduct themselves.  He said: "If this individual is making these decisions... you have a right to know about this man's private life and whether there is something in it he is trying to hold back from you."  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the question for Mr Whittingdale was not about his relationship, but about his role in regulating the press when the newspapers had a story about his private life.  Shadow culture secretary Ms Eagle accused Mr Whittingdale of changing his stance over the Leveson Inquiry, having previously supported a second stage - which was set to look into ties between newspapers and the police.  Earlier this year, it was reported in the Times that the second half would be "quietly" shelved.  Ms Eagle also called on him to clarify why he had not yet implemented key recommendations made by the inquiry, including some involving the awarding of costs against publishers in legal disputes.  The government says it has not decided whether to pursue a second stage of the inquiry. A No 10 spokesman said: "We've always said that criminal investigations and legal processes relating to Leveson need to have fully concluded before we consider part two."  Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott said it had long been her view that Mr Whittingdale's close relationship with the family of Rupert Murdoch - whose company News UK publishes the Sun - made him an "unsuitable person to deal with press regulation".  However, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said Mr Whittingdale "ought to get on and do his job", including pressing ahead with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry.  Media commentator and former newspaper editor Roy Greenslade said newspapers would have been wary about covering such a story in the aftermath of the Leveson report on press standards.  "I think it is a bit much to castigate the newspapers for doing the right thing for once," he added on Newsnight.  Journalist and media commentator Steve Hewlett said there was not "a single shred of evidence" that any form of direct contact, influence or attempted influence had actually happened but there remained "the question of perception".  However, Brian Cathcart, from the Hacked Off campaign group, insisted Mr Whittingdale was "compromised".  He said the newspapers "stocked up" the story for future use and as a way to possibly put "pressure on him".	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36015248	Implant lets paralysed man 'play guitar'	In a world first, a quadriplegic man can once again move his fingers after a chip was implanted in his brain.  Ian Burkhart from Ohio in the US can even move individual fingers to play a guitar-based computer game.  The chip reads brain signals, which are interpreted by a computer. It then precisely stimulates his muscles with electricity to restore movement.  The researchers hope the technology will eventually help millions of people with paralysis, stroke or brain damage.  Ian, 24, was seriously injured in a diving accident nearly six years ago.  The damage to his spinal cord left messages from his brain unable to reach the rest of his body and he was paralysed below the elbows and left unable to walk.  But now he is celebrating the "big shock" of being able to move his hand again after a procedure at Ohio State University.  A sensor was implanted inside his brain to read the activity of hundreds of neurons in his motor cortex.  It then took hours of practice to teach a sophisticated computer program how to understand the myriad signals in his brain.  Ian also wore a stimulating sleeve with 130 electrodes primed to stimulate and contract different muscles in his right arm.  The results, published in the journal Nature, showed he can grasp and move large objects, pour the contents of a glass and even swipe a credit card.  Ian described the early sessions as like seven-hour exams that left him "completely and mentally fatigued and exhausted".  "You really have to break down each part of that motion and think about it in a more concentrated way. For the first 19 years of my life it was something I definitely took for granted."  However, with practice he is learning new movements more quickly.  Ian is now dreaming of regaining the full function of both his hands as "that allows you to be a lot more independent and not have to rely on people for simple day-to-day tasks".  The study marks a significant moment in the field of using computers to bypass spinal cord injuries.  In 2012, a woman used her own thoughts to control a robotic arm, but now patients can control their own body again.  Dr Ali Rezai, the neurosurgeon who implanted the brain chip, said: "We're thrilled that Ian has progressed significantly with this technology.  "This really provides hope, we believe, for many patients in the future as this technology evolves and matures to help people who have disabilities from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury or stroke to allow them to be more functional and more independent."  One of the big challenges for the field will be to turn the spectacular feats in the laboratory into something that can be used in everyday life.  The approach requires surgery and then there are lots of trailing and bulky cables. It also needs a large computer to perform the complex algorithms to read the brain.  Also Ian's movements are not as deft as natural movement, even if they would have been unthinkable immediately after his accident.  However, the motor cortex has millions of neurons and only a few hundred are being read by the chip. It is hoped improvements in the technology will get closer to restoring true full function.  The approach of electronically bypassing an injury is just one frontier triggering excitement in the field of reversing paralysis.  Cells taken from a patient's nose have been used to repair a patient's spinal cord.  Darek Fidyka, a 40-year-old from Poland, can ride a tricycle after previously being paralysed from the waist down.  Dr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: "It is encouraging to see a number of therapeutic options to restore function being explored clinically, but these clinical forays are in their infancy and largely still remain at the level of proof of concept.  "Recent reports of cell and nerve grafts, this research and numerous trials and studies now point to progress.  "Is it time to accept the bar is now set higher? Should we now measure success when we see changes in clinical practice and these proof of concepts end as standards of care?  "I don't think it is too early or unhelpful to think along such lines, even if this some way off."	health

As culture secretary, John Whittingdale's job is to regulate newspapers and he is currently overseeing a whole new regulatory framework under consideration in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.  In 2011, it emerged that thousands of people, from celebrities to families of murder victims, had been victims of phone hacking by the now-defunct News of the World.  In response, Prime Minister David Cameron set up a public, judge-led investigation - the Leveson Inquiry - to examine the culture, behaviour and ethics of the press.  After hearing from numerous high-profile witnesses, Lord Leveson recommended newspapers should continue to be self-regulated - as they had been by the Press Complaints Commission - but that there should be a new press standards body created by the industry, backed by legislation, and with a new code of conduct.  The inquiry specifically focussed on the press, not into the media more generally. Broadcasters are regulated by Ofcom, which is backed by law.  In 2013, the then main political party leaders, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, agreed to set up a new press watchdog by Royal Charter.  It would have the power to impose million-pound fines on UK publishers and demand prominent corrections and apologies from UK news publishers, they said. Newspapers who refused to join the new regulatory regime would be liable - potentially - for hefty damages if a claim was upheld against them.  The press kicked back, saying the final draft of the Royal Charter plan was neither "voluntary or independent", and formed its own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), with wider powers than previous bodies.  David Cameron - uncomfortable with the idea of state interference in the press - rejected the idea of legislation to underpin the new system of regulation.  The compromise was the Royal Charter - an unlikely way to regulate the press. It is often described as a medieval form of documentation, used to set up universities.  The Royal Charter itself mainly sets out the workings of the body that is supposed to guarantee the self-regulator does its job properly.  But despite what one paper called its "flummery" the government spotted advantages to a Royal Charter. While an act of parliament can be amended with a simple majority, it was possible to insert a clause in the Royal Charter requiring any changes to be approved by a two-thirds majority.  Campaigners tentatively welcomed the Royal Charter plan, saying it would protect the public against the worst abuses of the press.  However, the newspaper industry raised concerns that it would give politicians too much power. The Newspaper Society said it was tantamount to "state-sponsored regulation".  The Royal Charter was approved by the Queen in October 2013. However, publishers have largely chosen not to sign up to the voluntary system, sticking instead with their own regulator Ipso.  A key part of the Royal Charter plan was a law requiring publishers to pay both sides' costs in a privacy or libel case, even if they won - unless they signed up to the official press regulator.  This has been passed by Parliament - as section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 - but still needs to be signed off by Culture Secretary John Whittingdale.  Victims of press intrusion have accused the government of breaking its promise over regulation.  Mr Whittingdale says it is "under consideration" and has told newspaper editors he questions whether this legal change will be "positive" for the newspaper industry.  Labour's Maria Eagle says Mr Whittingdale must "clarify exactly why he no longer believes" section 40 of the act should come into force.  Labour has now also called for Mr Whittingdale to withdraw from press regulation decisions after it emerged four newspapers were aware of his past relationship with a sex worker,but did not run the story.  While the first part of the Leveson Inquiry has finished, a second stage looking at the relationship between the press and the police is yet to come.  It was put on hold until all criminal and legal proceedings linked to the phone-hacking scandal were completed - although there have been suggestions that it may be shelved altogether.  The major phone-hacking trials of News International journalists concluded in 2014.  Labour has demanded the second stage goes ahead, but Downing Street says no decision has yet been taken about whether to continue with the inquiry.  According to a House of Lords report, the first stage of Leveson cost £5.4m.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36038672	Lead EU referendum campaigns named	Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe have been designated as the official Leave and Remain campaigns in June's EU referendum.  Vote Leave - backed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - saw off a challenge from a rival campaign Grassroots Out, backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  The campaigns will be allowed to spend up to £7m, get a free mailshot, TV broadcasts and £600,000 public funds.  The Electoral Commission made the decision after weeks of deliberation.  It is likely to have a major impact on the shape of the debate in the run up to 23 June's referendum.  It means Nigel Farage will not feature on official Leave campaign literature, with Vote Leave insiders fearing the UKIP leader would alienate centre ground voters they believe hold the key to winning. The group wants to make a "positive" case for leaving the EU, with less emphasis on immigration.  Britain Stronger in Europe is likely to continue to focus on the impact of an exit on jobs and economic prosperity.  Grassroots Out founder, Tory MP Peter Bone, said his campaign would continue, but with a spending limit of £700,000, as he attempted to draw a line under the bitter war of words between his group and Vote Leave.  He added: "We look forward to working closely and productively with all those who want to see the UK set free to determine its own destiny."  A spokesman for Vote Leave said: "Our focus has always been the real campaign and the £350m we send to Brussels every week which we want to spend on our priorities like the NHS. We will continue to work constructively with everyone who wants to campaign for a Leave vote."  Nigel Farage offered an olive branch to Vote Leave, saying he could work with them as they had accepted his argument that immigration must play a central role in the debate.  The UKIP leader added: "Regardless of whichever campaign got the designation, UKIP would always have played a big role in this campaign as the only national party committed to leaving the EU and with a substantial £4m spending limit.  "I have always wanted all on the Leave side to come together and have done my best to try and make this happen. I'll continue to do so in the run up to the referendum to ensure the Leave side wins."  But Leave.EU, a group backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, which supported Grassroots Out, said it was planning to seek a judicial review of the Electoral Commission's decision, with Mr Banks claiming it "smells of political corruption" and did not make sense.  The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also applied for designation as the official Leave campaign, claiming left-wing anti-EU views were not being properly represented, but its application was also rejected by the Electoral Commission.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron - who is backing a vote to Remain in the EU - welcomed the designation of Britain Stronger in Europe with a message on Twitter: "Congratulations to @StrongerIn who have been designated as the Remain campaign in the EU referendum. We're stronger, safer and better off in."  Britain Stronger in Europe - chaired by former Marks and Spencer boss Stuart, now Lord, Rose - was the only campaign to apply for Remain designation.  Britain Stronger In Europe executive director Will Straw said: "I'm delighted that the Electoral Commission have recognised that Britain Stronger in Europe has the breadth of support, the unity of purpose and the campaigning organisation to be the official Remain campaign in the upcoming referendum."  He congratulated Vote Leave on gaining the designation but called on them to "come clean with the British people and say what Out looks like".  The elections watchdog said it had based its decision on the campaign "which appears to us to represent those campaigning for that outcome to the greatest extent".  The Commission's assessment scorecard, which took into account factors such as breadth of support and funding levels, gave the Out designation to Vote Leave by 49 to 45.  Chief Executive Claire Bassett said: "We received two high quality applications on the 'Leave' side, from 'Vote Leave Ltd' and 'The Go Movement Ltd'. After careful consideration, the Commission decided that 'Vote Leave Ltd' better demonstrated that it has the structures in place to ensure the views of other campaigners are represented in the delivery of its campaign.  "It therefore represents, to a greater extent than 'Go Movement Ltd', those campaigning for the 'Leave' outcome, which is the test we must apply.  "We encourage all campaigners to now focus on engaging voters on the historic decision they will have to take on 23 June."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34505076	The people hoping to persuade UK to vote to stay in the EU	Meet the men and women who have been given the job of persuading Britain to stay in the EU in 23 June's referendum.  David Cameron called the referendum and, with many commentators speculating that his political future rests on the outcome, he has already taken on the role of figurehead of the campaign to remain in the EU.  The prime minister has promised to devote two or three days a week to take his pro-EU message around the country and to defend the concessions he won from other EU leaders during his recent renegotiation.  He has angered many in his own party with his outspoken stance and tactics, accusing Leave supporters of spreading "scare stories" and backing a controversial £9m pro-EU leaflet drop to every UK household.  It is not clear if the prime minister will take part in any of the planned TV debates. He has insisted that he will remain in Downing Street whatever the result.  Britain Stronger in Europe has been chosen as the official lead campaign to make the case for the UK remaining in the European Union.  It draws its support from across the political spectrum, including key figures from the Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the former leader of the Green Party.  The cross-party umbrella group was the only organisation to apply to the Electoral Commission for the status of flag bearer for the Remain side, which confers special financial benefits.  It will be able to spend up to £7m during the campaign, including a £600,000 public grant for a free public mailshot and TV broadcasts. There are a number of other groups backing the Remain campaign but they will have a spending limit of £700,000.  Britain Stronger in Europe will play a crucial role in shaping the referendum debate and taking on the arguments of its rival Vote Leave.  It is expected to focus on the economic benefits of the UK remaining in the EU, the enhanced global influence that membership brings for Britain and the uncertainty that will be caused by a vote to leave.  It is a Westminster-based group, which has the support of a plethora of pro-EU campaign groups, including the European Movement, Open Europe and the Centre for European Reform.  It is seeking to broaden its appeal, particularly to younger and BME voters. Its board members include Megan Dunn, the president of the National Union of Students, theatre director Jude Kelly and former Channel 4 presenter June Sarpong.  Details of who is bankrolling the campaign have so far been sketchy but expect significant contributions from the City, which is worried about the implications for cross-border finance of a UK exit.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  The group's biggest donor so far is reported to be Lord Sainsbury, the former supermarket magnate who was a science minister during the last Labour government. Other key figures could include Sir Richard Branson and Richard Reed, the founder of Innocent Drinks.  Lord Rose - former chair of Marks and Spencer  One of the UK's best-known business figures, the former chief executive of Burton Group, Argos and Arcadia Group is chair of the campaign. He was knighted in 2008 for "services to the retail industry", and became a Tory peer in 2014.  Launching the campaign, he said the EU was not perfect, but said staying in was the "patriotic course for Britain".  The peer will be playing a largely figurehead role, using his credentials to court business support. But critics have questioned whether such an establishment figure is what is needed to win over undecided voters.  And his sure-footedness and command of detail came under scrutiny when he appeared before MPs last month.  Will Straw is a pivotal figure in the campaign who will be appearing a lot on our TV screens in the coming weeks.  The son of former Labour home secretary Jack Straw, he is active in the Labour Party. The Oxford graduate and former head of the National Union of Students worked for the IPPR think tank and as a Treasury adviser under Alistair Darling.  But his attempt to enter Parliament last year failed as he lost the Rossendale and Darwin seat in Lancashire by 5,654 votes. He has often fielded tough questions on policy and brings cross-party appeal.  The founder and chairman of financial PR firm Finsbury, he is a City networker with impeccable political contacts - one of his sisters is the Climate Change and Energy Secretary Amber Rudd, while he has numerous friends in New Labour circles.  He started his career working for the former SDP leader David Owen. During a successful career in journalism, he worked for the Financial Times among others before moving into PR and selling his business in 2001 - netting him a reported £41m.  He founded Business for a New Europe in 2006 to speak up on behalf of the benefits of EU membership but was on the losing side in the 2011 referendum on the voting system, when he backed the Alternative Vote.  A regular presence putting the Remain case on TV and radio, Lucy Thomas is a former BBC producer and Lib Dem press officer who held a variety of senior roles, including campaign director, for Business for New Europe before joining Britain Stronger in Europe.  He was at Nick Clegg's side for more than five years as the Lib Dem leader's spin doctor during the turbulent coalition years. He left his job as a special adviser after the party's disastrous election result. A popular figure with the press pack, the keen Arsenal fan will be devising the campaign's all important media strategy.  The former head of the Trade Union Congress is one of a dozen other figures on the organisation's board, including politicians, businessmen, entrepreneurs and broadcasters.  Mr Barber will be expected to liaise with the trade union movement, which is largely in support of EU membership and whose contribution will be vital if the In campaign is to be successful.  With Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn so far having taken a back seat in the campaign, there are concerns about whose is going to enthuse and mobilise the blue collar vote.  Mr Barber was general secretary of the TUC for nine years between 2003 and 2012, working for the organisation for more than thirty years. The Everton fan is now chair of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) Council  There are a plethora of other groups linked to political parties supporting EU membership.  The Labour In For Britain campaign is being fronted by ex-Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who promises to "put the country's future above party machinations". The Liberal Democrats say staying in the EU will keep the UK "prosperous, secure and relevant".  The Green Party says the UK will "flourish when we work together on the shared challenges we face", including the environment. Launching the SNP's campaign, Nicola Sturgeon warned David Cameron against fighting a "miserable, negative, fear-based" campaign.  The Conservative Party is neutral on the issue of the referendum. More than 100 Tory MPs, including four Cabinet members, take the opposite view to Mr Cameron and want the UK to leave.  We can expect interventions from other high-profile figures, including former prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major.  The Labour leader has taken a softly-softly approach to the issue so far.  Although he attended the launch of Labour's Remain in EU campaign, he has not raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions and will make his first substantive speech backing EU membership on Thursday.  Mr Corbyn, who is more Eurosceptic than his predecessors, is under pressure to do more to make the case for EU membership in his own terms. Many of his allies are backing a separate campaign, Another Europe is Possible, accentuating the social benefits of being in the EU.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36033481	The people hoping to persuade UK to vote to leave the EU	Meet the men and women who have been given the job of persuading Britain to leave the European Union in 23 June's referendum.  It is the organisation that has been chosen by the Electoral Commission to take the lead in making the case for Britain to leave the European Union. Although the big names at the head of the campaign are all Conservatives it has support from Labour, Lib Dem and UKIP figures too, as well as business people.  Dozens of other organisations - including UKIP - will also be making their case. But only Vote Leave will get access to £600,000 in public funds, be given a free mailshot to every household in the UK, make TV broadcasts and be allowed to spend up to £7m of money it has raised. Other anti-EU groups will be restricted to spending £700,000, and there are quite a lot of them (there are about 14 groups under the Grassroots Out banner alone).  Vote Leave will play a crucial role in shaping the referendum debate. It is expected to focus on the positive case for leaving, arguing that Britain can take back control of its own destiny, with less emphasis on immigration than UKIP has done in the past, with the aim of winning over wavering voters in the centre ground.  It is a Westminster-based group but it is building up a network of grassroots supporters and has a growing list of affiliated groups, including Veterans for Britain, Muslims for Britain, Aussies for Britain, Out and Proud (an LBGT group), and even Vapers for Britain, who are campaigning against EU regulation of e-cigarettes.  City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave. Other business backers include former Conservative treasurer and Dixons boss Lord Kalms, Christopher Foyle, the chairman of Foyles bookshop, Joe Foster, the founder of Reebok, and John Caudwell, a philanthropist and co-founder of Phones4U, are among its other business backers.  This is the group that will meet every day during the campaign to plot strategy and decide on the messages to put out to the media.  As one of the cabinet's big hitters and a close friend of the prime minister, Gove was a crucial signing for Vote Leave. A longstanding opponent of Britain's membership of the EU, who kept his views to himself until the referendum date was announced, the justice secretary is the joint head of the Vote Leave campaign.  One of a small group of Labour MPs opposed to Britain's membership of the EU, the German-born Stuart replaced former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson as co-chair Vote Leave, as the group sought to prove it had cross-party support. A widely-respected figure in the Commons, she has been MP for Birmingham Edgbaston since 1997 and was one of the British MPs delegated to help draw up an EU constitution, an experience that helped convince her Britain should leave.  Johnson's decision to join the Vote Leave cause was seen as a potential game changer by the group's leaders. He has ruled out a head-to-head TV debate with David Cameron, the man he one day hopes to replace as Conservative leader, but he has not proved shy of tackling the PM's arguments and denouncing the Remain campaign's arguments in his trademark shambling style.  The bespectacled 38-year-old is seen as one of the most effective lobbyists at Westminster. Best known as the founder of the pressure group The Taxpayers Alliance, he also ran the successful 'No2AV' campaign in the referendum on reform of the voting system in 2011. He is assisted by Stephen Parkinson who left his job as one of Theresa May's special advisors to join the campaign.  Cummings cut his campaigning teeth in his native North-East, as part of the successful campaign against a regional assembly, in a 2004 referendum. His blunt, uncompromising style has put noses out of joint in the past, particularly during his spell as a special adviser to Michael Gove when he was education secretary, but he is seen by supporters as a clever, original thinker.  Davidson has represented Glasgow constituencies in Parliament since 1992, but lost his seat in the SNP landslide at last year's general election. A longstanding Eurosceptic on the left of the party, he is a former chairman of the trade union group of Labour MPs who believes in the abolition of the Monarchy.  Cabinet Ministers John Whittingdale, Theresa Villiers and Chris Grayling - and Priti Patel who attends cabinet - headed straight for Vote Leave's headquarters to man the phones, along with the then minister Iain Duncan Smith - after David Cameron named the referendum debate.  Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson is on the board, along with home shopping magnate and Labour donor John Mills. Former Labour foreign secretary and SDP founder Lord Owen is also playing a high profile role.  UKIP spokeswoman Suzanne Evans - currently suspended from the party after a row - and former Lib Dem MP Paul Keetch are also expected to figure, along with UKIP MP Douglas Carswell.  The UKIP leader is the face of Euroscepticism in the UK and did as much as anybody to secure a referendum in the first place. He is a leading member of the Grassroots Out group, which lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign - but that does not mean he will be taking a back seat. It is not yet clear how he will work with Vote Leave - he does not get on with the group's management - but he is certain to be a major presence on our TV screens and at public meetings in the run up to 23 June. UKIP will have a £4m spending limit - if it can raise that amount it will have a big voice in the campaign.  Mr Farage offered an olive branch to Vote Leave, when the designation was announced.  "I congratulate Vote Leave on getting designation. The decision of UKIP to back Grassroots Out was on the basis that they saw the importance of the immigration issue in this referendum, and that we wanted to reach out across the country at a grassroots level and work with everyone from the left, centre and right of British politics to get our country out of the EU. I believe this approach is the only way the Leave side can win this referendum.  "It is clear that Vote Leave now share my view on this approach, for instance the issue of EU open borders is now a prominent part of their campaign messaging."  He added: "We in UKIP, as I've said from the start, will work with anyone that wants to leave the EU. We must work together to get our country out of the European Union."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36037507	Why Vote Leave beat Grassroots Out	The battle to become the official campaign to quit the EU has finally been settled by the Electoral Commission.  Its decision means Vote Leave gets increased spending limits of £7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts and a free mail-out to households.  But why was Vote Leave, not the rival Grassroots Out organisation, chosen?  Speaking after the announcement, Grassroots Out's Peter Bone joked that his group's distinctive green ties might have swung the decision against them.  In fact, the criteria were rather more technical.  Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett said both had submitted "high quality" applications, which had been analysed "in some detail".  In the end, she said, it came down to which group had the greater "depth of representation" of EU exit campaigners.  The final decision was taken at an Electoral Commission board meeting this morning.  Both organisations - as well as the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) - had submitted applications setting out their case.  The commission's scorecard reveals Vote Leave scored 49 to Grassroots Out's 45. It rated higher in the categories of "support for application", "representing other campaigners" and "organisational capacity".  The commission said both groups had demonstrated support from a wide range of organisations - but Vote Leave had "better demonstrated the depth of representation in their support from those campaigning, including at a regional and local level".  It also had "well-developed plans... for how they would support other campaigning organisations", the commission said.  The left-wing TUSC's application was rejected as it "did not demonstrate that it adequately represented other campaigners".  Asked about the possibility of a judicial review bid by the Grassroots Out-supporting Leave.EU campaign, Ms Bassett said the commission's decision had been reached "transparently, openly and robustly" and she was confident it would withstand a challenge.	politics

A guide to the row involving Fleet Street, press reform campaigners and the Labour Party over revelations about Culture Secretary John Whittingdale's relationship with an escort.  He is currently the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.  The Conservative MP for Maldon and East Chelmsford, 56, was previously chairman of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee for 10 years.  Before becoming an MP in 1992 he was political secretary to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.  Mr Whittingdale had a relationship with a woman he met on an online dating website who turned out to be an escort.  He says he had no idea she was a sex worker and ended the relationship when he found out in 2014 - before he was made a government minister with responsibility for press regulation.  Four newspapers knew about the relationship but decided not to publish the story.  The newspapers involved, and many of the media pundits who have had their say so far, say there was simply no public interest in publishing a story about the love life of a single man who was not a government minister.  But campaign group Hacked Off points to Mr Whittingdale's remit, which includes press regulation, saying the papers have questions to answer about why the story never saw the light of day.  Hacked Off - and the Labour Party - say the unpublished story presented a potential conflict of interest for Mr Whittingdale, in particular concerning his decisions on how tightly the press should be controlled. His position has been compromised, they say.  Labour's Chris Bryant, who was previously shadow culture secretary, says it "seems the press were quite deliberately holding a sword of Damocles over John Whittingdale".  Mr Whittingdale did not inform Downing Street about the story when he was made culture secretary, and No 10 confirmed it was not aware of the relationship.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the question for him was not about the relationship, but about his role in regulating the press when the newspapers had a story about his private life.  Kuenssberg: Why does the story matter now?  The backdrop to the row is the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, established in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal which led to the closure of the News of the World in 2011 after revelations journalists illegally accessed people's phones for stories.  Published in 2012, the inquiry made a number of recommendations and many newspapers were strongly opposed to key parts.  Newspapers have set up their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, but Hacked Off says important parts of Lord Leveson's report have not been implemented.  In particular, one of the regulations would require newspapers to pay libel costs even if they won a case brought against them, should they not have previously offered a low-cost means of resolving the claim.  This rule - section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 has been passed by Parliament but needs to be signed off by Mr Whittingdale.  He says it is "under consideration", but Labour's Maria Eagle says Mr Whittingdale must "clarify exactly why he no longer believes" section 40 should come into force.  There is also due to be a second part of the inquiry, looking at ties between newspapers and the police, which could not take place until criminal cases had been completed.  There have been reports this inquiry has been shelved, but the government says it has not yet decided whether to pursue it.  A Downing Street spokesman said: "We've always said that criminal investigations and legal processes relating to Leveson need to have fully concluded before we consider part two."  Press regulation: What you need to know  The opposition has called on Mr Whittingdale to withdraw from decisions on press regulation.  His opposite number, Maria Eagle, said he had "reneged" on a cross-party agreement to implement Leveson having previously supported it when select committee chairman.  She said he should "recuse himself" from decisions on the subject "in order for the public to have any confidence in the government's approach to press regulation".  Downing Street sources say it would be ludicrous for Mr Whittingdale to be vulnerable because of a decision by newspapers not to publish a story about him.  The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was no sense Labour would get its demand, adding that it was important to note Mr Whittingdale as a political character would always have be expected to favour "light touch" regulation of the press.  The culture secretary put out a statement saying the "old story" about his relationship had been "a bit embarrassing at the time".  He added: "The events occurred long before I took up my present position and it has never had any influence on the decisions I have made as culture secretary."  Downing Street said he was "a single man entitled to a private life" and had the full confidence of the prime minister.  Should the story have been published in any case? On the Today programme, Hacked Off's Evan Harris said there were public interest arguments in favour of publication, including the fact that Mr Whittingdale had "lectured" former F1 boss Max Mosley, who had been the subject of a tabloid expose, during a committee hearing. He also said "these sorts of stories" are often run with no public interest justification.  Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis said such a story may have been published in the pre-Leveson era, but said under the new regime it had been judged not to merit publication.  Media pundit Steve Hewlett said the newspapers had in fact behaved "entirely in keeping with the way that the privacy campaigners wanted them to behave in any other circumstances".  Some have accused Hacked Off themselves of hypocrisy for calling for publication of a story about Mr Whittingdale's private life having long campaigned against press intrusion.  While Mr Whittingdale does not look like losing his responsibility for press regulation as Labour demand, Laura Kuenssberg said a reshuffle was expected in the aftermath of the EU referendum.  She added: "This is certainly the kind of headache that the government could do without, and it's the kind of story, involving politicians, the papers, and sex, that could well take an unpredictable turn."	politics

Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said there was a "disconnect" between the government's rhetoric and its actions and that HMRC's budget had been cut.  The SNP's Angus Robertson said 10 times more officials were investigating welfare fraud than tax evasion.  The PM said the figure sounded "bogus" and HMRC staff numbers were going up.  The PMQs clash was the first since a huge leak of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to dodge tax and avoid sanctions.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the tax debate's prominence in the Commons showed how much of a big issue it had been, with opposition parties determined to "hang it around the prime minister".  Mr Corbyn focused all his questions on tax, saying Conservative MEPs have voted against new EU-wide country-by-country reporting measures, while the government had cut tax official jobs and shut down tax offices.  The PM said the new reporting measures were "based on the work we've been doing" and had been proposed by the UK's commissioner, Lord Hill..  The leaders also traded blows over how transparent overseas territories would have to be under the new regime.  Mr Corbyn said the Cayman Islands premier was "celebrating victory" because beneficial ownership information would not be available publicly or directly to UK agencies.  The PM said overseas and crown dependencies would provide beneficial ownership information, but would not make the information public because otherwise some might have "walked away from this co-operation altogether".  Mr Cameron, who has faced questions about his own tax arrangements and his father's offshore investment firm, aimed a joke at Mr Corbyn's recently-released tax return, saying the "late, chaotic, inaccurate and uncosted" document was a metaphor for Labour Party policy.  Mr Corbyn hit back, saying he paid more tax than companies owned by people Mr Cameron "might know quite well".  Green Party MP Caroline Lucas also asked the PM about tax, questioning how effective the investigation into Mossack Fonseca in the UK would be.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36034243	'Unacceptable gaps' in NHS baby transfer service	There are completely unacceptable gaps in NHS services designed to help sick and premature babies, a child health expert says.  A snapshot survey by the charity Bliss showed neonatal transport services in the UK were understaffed and under-resourced.  The charity says some babies are having to wait too long for life-saving care.  But NHS England says care is as good as other European countries, despite growing demand.  Nearly 16,000 babies are transferred between hospitals in the UK each year using 17 dedicated transfer services.  These often include specially kitted-out vehicles that have incubators, resuscitation equipment and specially trained staff.  These vehicles can be used, for example, to move a baby born early to an intensive care or surgical centre that only some hospitals have access to.  But the Bliss survey, looking at one week across the UK, found six out of 11 transfer services that provided data had gaps in their staff rotas.  Prof Neena Modi, leader of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said staff shortages were a long-term issue and that neonatal services had faced substantial funding cuts.  "Delay in transfer can seriously adversely affect a baby's chances of a good outcome, so this is completely unacceptable for a modern health service."  The report also found eight units in England were not able to transfer babies within one hour of receiving a call, as NHS standards recommend.  And nearly 1,000 babies were transferred every year because neonatal units did not have capacity for them.  The report authors say the government and NHS need to resolve shortages in staff and put more money towards services "so that every baby has the best chance of survival and quality of life".  Meanwhile an NHS England spokesperson said: "Despite increasing demand, studies consistently show standards of NHS neonatal care are equivalent to other European countries.  "We continue to work across the health service to improve neonatal services, ensuring every premature or sick baby achieves the best outcomes and care within the resources available."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36034657	Labour's problem with anti-Semitism	Remember the councillor who thought Hitler was the greatest man in history?  Remember the candidate who suggested asking the so-called Islamic State why it wasn't attacking Israel?  Remember the student who said a large part of the Oxford University Labour Club had a "problem with Jews"?  Imagine the reaction, Jewish figures say, if these were stories about any other minority.  They appear with politically damaging regularity.  Now, though, it seems change will come.  Activists and MPs have told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they are trying to toughen the rules on anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and racism.  Even if they fail, I'm told a party review by Labour peer Lady Royall into allegations of anti-Semitism may well also suggest rewriting the rulebook.  That is highly unlikely to be the end of this story, though, because it goes to the heart of a poisonous atmosphere in parts of the Labour movement.  Jeremy Corbyn's critics - who are many and vociferous - put the blame at his door.  It is he, they say, who has attracted new members with these views, who has condemned anti-Semitism but not acted and who has - on occasion - made what they think are utterly inadequate responses to offensive language.  Their concerns are fundamental - they simply don't believe anyone who describes the Palestinian militant group Hamas as a friend wants to tackle this issue.  On the other side, his supporters remind us of those condemnations of anti-Semitism and the decision to launch an inquiry, and point out this is not a new problem.  Lost in the fury about a member suspended then readmitted after anti-Semitic comments only to become vice-chair of her local party, was the fact those decisions were made not under Mr Corbyn, but his predecessor Ed Miliband.  No Labour leader could be expected to vet the thousands of new members who have signed up.  For some fighting Mr Corbyn's corner, this issue is serious and real, but is also being used as a stick to beat him by his internal political enemies.  There are those who have long seen allegations of anti-Semitism as attempts to silence legitimate criticism of Israel - on which different wings of the Labour movement take passionately opposing views.  The political debate, then, is not at heart merely a row about rules or party management, but fundamental differences within Labour.  Changing the rulebook will not necessarily change what people say or write, merely how they are dealt with.  It certainly won't change how people feel, and there are plenty in Labour who seek no part in its civil wars but wonder why anti-Semites choose to join their party.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36029862	Labour activists seek rule change to ban anti-Semitic members	Labour MPs and activists are trying to change party rules to make it easier to expel anti-Semitic members, with clear cases to result in a lifetime ban.  Local parties are set to vote on a proposed change in the coming weeks.  The move follows accusations that leader Jeremy Corbyn has been slow to act on anti-Semitism.  Mr Corbyn has said Labour is "resolute" in tackling anti-Semitism, saying anyone who commits anti-Semitic acts is "auto-suspended" pending an inquiry.  The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said people who express anti-Semitic views should be expelled for life.  But Jeremy Newmark from the Jewish Labour Movement said the party's current rules do not match commitments from Labour's leadership.  Mr Newmark, who also chairs a Labour party branch, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Everybody's talking about zero tolerance of anti-Semitism but it's become apparent because of a spate of incidents over the last couple of months that the rules and processes of the party don't provide adequate provision to deal with it."  He hopes the motion will be accepted by local parties and then adopted by Labour's annual conference in the autumn.  Along with MPs Wes Streeting and Anna Turley he wants a new rule that would ban the use of anti-Semitic, Islamophobic or racist language by members.  It is understood at least one shadow minister will back the initiative.  Mr Streeting said: "We've now got a problem where too many of our Jewish members and people out there in the country think the Labour Party is apathetic to anti-Semitism and it isn't a place for Jewish members.  "I think we've got to make sure that this party with its historic commitment to tackling all forms of prejudice including anti-Semitism is still a place for Jewish people."  Activists are frustrated people who have made abusive comments in the past have been allowed back into the party after suspensions.  In 2014, Vicki Kirby - then a candidate in Woking - was suspended after tweeting that Jews had "big noses" and suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God". She was later reinstated, becoming the vice-chair of her local party, before being suspended again.  A party spokeswoman said: "We welcome the contributions of Labour's affiliates and members in this important debate. Rule changes can be submitted to Labour's annual conference where they are democratically agreed by delegates."  Among the local Labour parties that will consider the motion are Hornsey and Wood Green, Tottenham, Hackney North, Hendon, Hertsmere and Sheffield Hallam.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36028001	Testing times ahead for Universal Credit	The government's scheme to overhaul the welfare system has been the subject of much scrutiny in Westminster, but now the same is happening outside a north London job centre.  Two claimants become animated as they wait for the next part of their appointment inside.  No, they don't want to do an interview - but yes, they have something to say about Universal Credit - the single payment streamlining six current in-work benefits.  One woman was supposed to sign up to it, she says, only to be told she wasn't eligible - and doesn't know why.  Another thinks paying housing costs directly to claimants is a terrible idea which some people will find impossible to manage.  It is hardly a representative survey about one of the biggest changes to benefits since the start of the welfare state, but it tells you something important: Universal Credit has arrived.  It is now up and running in 690 jobcentres and will be available for all single jobseekers in all jobcentres from the end of April.  Almost 405,000 people have now made a claim for Universal Credit.  After delays, IT problems and an entire "reset" of the system - the piecemeal, if deliberately slow, implementation has begun.  But that is the simpler part; the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) now has to deliver the changes to 20 times that number of people, many of whose cases will be far more complex, in a project already running several years late.  And it no longer resembles the scheme originally conceived under former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, at a cost £1.7 billion pounds to implement.  Universal Credit was meant to bring "radical changes" to people's real incomes and incentivise them to move off benefits and into work, according to David Finch, a former economic analyst at the DWP.  "But... the strength of the improved incentives it was meant to bring have been gradually eroded," he says, speaking in his current role as a researcher at the Resolution Foundation.  There have been significant tensions between the Treasury and the DWP over its cost.  Last year the government announced funding cuts to the universal credit "work allowance" - reducing the amount people can earn before benefit payments are withdrawn.  Labour believes those changes have left the project in a perilous situation.  "Universal Credit is a great idea that unfortunately is running the risk of being stillborn as a result of the cuts that Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith oversaw," says Labour's work and pensions spokesman Owen Smith.  "It should make work pay for people but unless (new work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb) reverses the cuts to the work allowance and restores the work incentives it's going to leave millions of people worse off."  Iain Duncan Smith's resignation in March came amid a febrile atmosphere over planned government cuts to disability benefits - later reversed - resulting in the effective protection of the welfare budget at current levels.  The former cabinet minister criticised the "cutting away and eroding" of universal credit and an "assault" on its incentives system while he was in office.  But those close to Mr Duncan Smith regard other criticisms of Universal Credit as over-played and a "media narrative".  One source said the project was now "wholly owned by the civil service" and that there was no concern that Mr Duncan Smith's departure compromises it.  Certainly the speech by his successor Stephen Crabb confirmed that.  Mr Crabb said he was "absolutely committed" to the reform, describing it as "the spine that runs through the welfare system".  So where does all this leave us?  Despite many people losing out after last year's changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks the objective of Universal Credit remains broadly intact - some of the worst disincentives to moving off welfare and into work will be gone under the new system.  Government officials claim it will help generate £7bn in economic benefit each year and say it will "revolutionise" welfare.  But its biggest challenge may lie not in its politics or even divided opinions over its funding, but in its delivery.  In May it will start to be made available to all types of new claimants, including those on ESA illness and disability payments where perhaps greater political sensitivity lies.  The full service will be available at five new job centre areas per month, ramping up to 50 a month in 2017.  These will be testing times for a project aiming to reach eight million households by the end of this parliament.	politics

Its figures show around 19 in every 100,000 women in the UK were diagnosed with the disease in the 1990s - climbing to 29 in 100,000 in 2013.  Researchers acknowledge the science behind how extra weight is linked to cancer is not clear - but say hormones produced by extra fat may play a part.  They say more studies are needed.  Around 9,000 women are diagnosed with womb cancer in the UK each year and around 2,000 women die from the disease.  Researchers say treatments have improved over the last 20 years - mirrored by better chances of survival.  But they call for more research to understand why a greater number of women are getting the disease.  Prof Jonathan Lederman, at Cancer Research UK, said: "It is worrying that womb cancer cases are going up so sharply.  "We don't know all the reasons why, but we do know that about a third of cases are linked to being overweight - so it is no surprise to see the increases in womb cancer cases echo rising obesity levels."  It's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase the risk of developing the condition.  Experts say extra fat may produce hormones and growth factor molecules that encourage cells to replicate, increasing the chance of tumours forming.  Other factors - such as a lack of exercise, age and genes have all been implicated too.  Kath Bebbington, who is 56 and from Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with womb cancer three years ago and said it prompted her to change her eating and exercise habits.  She added: "My cancer diagnosis was a wake-up call for me. It was a shock because I don't smoke, I don't drink and I walk a lot.  "And we don't know what caused the cancer but I had to admit to myself that I needed to make some lifestyle changes to lose some extra pounds I had been carrying and stack the odds in my favour for a healthy future."  Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: "We know that being overweight or obese increases our risk of some cancers which is why it's important to keep an eye on portion sizes and cut back on calories, sugar and fat in the diet."	health

After just 20 minutes, chairman Keith Vaz ordered him to leave the session.  Mr Robbins was told to return to the Home Office and provide the answers by the end of the working day.  Mr Vaz said: "I'm going to excuse you from this committee because I think your evidence so far has been unsatisfactory."  The Whitehall mandarin had been asked by the committee whether Sir Charles Montgomery, the organisation's director general, had been told what his budget was for the year.  Sir Charles, who reports to Mr Robbins, had previously told the committee he expected to know the figure by the start of the financial year.  Mr Robbins said it was "not easy to answer it in a simple yes or no".  But a clearly irritated Mr Vaz said someone of Mr Robbins' position should know the answer to the question whether "someone below them knows what their budget is or not".  "It is extremely unsatisfactory," he added, and said he expected the answer from Mr Robbins by 18:00 BST.  Mr Vaz also said he would be writing to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to complain.	politics

The ballot was triggered by the death of Lord Avebury, the former MP Eric Lubbock, earlier this year.  Those standing include Viscount John Thurso, a former MP and Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor, the great grandson of the former Liberal prime minister.  Only the three current Lib Dem hereditary peers in the Lords are entitled to vote in the contest.  The small but select band of electors consists of the Earl of Oxford and Asquith - the great grandson of former Prime Minister Herbert Asquith - the Earl of Glasgow and Lord Addington.  Ballots must be cast by 17.00 BST on 18 April, with the result due to be announced the following day.  John Thurso was MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross for 14 years before losing his seat last year, while Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor has worked in industries ranging from fishing to risk insurance.  The five other candidates are:  Each has been asked to submit a 75-word statement about their background and relevant experience.  Reforms to the Lords by the last Labour government left just 92 hereditary peers in place. Since then vacancies arising from the death of members have been filled through a series of by-elections.	politics

The business secretary also hinted at plans to use more UK steel in defence projects, in a bid to help the struggling industry.  Mr Javid told MPs he was fighting for Britain's steelworkers "every hour of the day" to resolve the crisis.  But Labour said the government's response had been "wanting".  The exchanges came during a three-hour emergency debate on the crisis facing the UK's steel industry.  The debate was granted by the Commons Speaker after a request from Labour, which complained the government had refused to recall Parliament from its Easter break to discuss the issue.  Tata Steel has begun the formal process of selling its loss-making UK plants, putting thousands of jobs at risk. However, a buyer has been found for its Scunthorpe plant.  The future of the larger Port Talbot is still in doubt, although at least one potential buyer has expressed an interest.  The government has resisted calls from unions and opposition politicians to nationalise the Port Talbot plant, Britain's biggest steelworks.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons on Monday the government was working hard to find a private sector buyer for Port Talbot, with "the possibility of co-investing with a buyer on commercial terms" under consideration.  As MPs debated the crisis on Tuesday, Mr Javid faced calls to clarify exactly what "co-investment" in the plant would mean.  He told them: "The key point is that any co-investment would have to be on commercial terms, investment can take a variety of forms, for example it could be debt.  "But again it's a demonstration of all the options the government is looking at."  SNP employment spokesman Neil Gray accused the government of a lack of clarity over the option, saying it was "uncoordinated and shambolic".  Who might buy Tata in Port Talbot?  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  The business secretary also told MPs to expect an announcement "in the coming days" on Ministry of Defence (MoD) acquisition of British steel.  But Labour's shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the coalition government axed Labour's defence industrial strategy which she said ensured gave priority to British industries when MoD contracts were awarded.  "We now have the deeply regrettable situation of an aircraft carrier, British surface ships and armoured vehicles all being manufactured in the UK with mainly imported steel, when, with more planning, our domestic industry could have supplied these needs," she added.  Meanwhile, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock - whose Aberavon constituency is home to the Port Talbot plant - criticised the government's whole approach to the steel crisis which he said had been characterised by a "dangerous combination of indifference, incompetence and rolling out the red carpet for Beijing".  But Mr Javid told MPs: "The crisis the steel industry faces is global, but I am fighting for Britain's steelworkers every hour of the day.  "I was fighting for them long before this crisis hit the headlines and I will go on fighting as long as it takes, because Britain's steelworkers are the best in the world and they deserve no less."  Tata's Long Products Europe business, which includes the Scunthorpe plant, was sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a token £1 or €1. The move will safeguard 4,400 UK jobs, but workers are being asked to accept a pay cut and less generous pension arrangements.  The business will be rebranded as British Steel once the deal is completed in eight weeks, the company said.	politics

So how could he tell the Today programme he wasn't "personally affected" after he announced the cut in 2012?  Then he said: "My salary is less than the £150,000 threshold. That's the cabinet minister's salary, indeed we cut the cabinet minister's salary when we came to office so I'm not personally affected."  He went on to say he wasn't a 50p rate payer, as the BBC reported at the time.  A source insists the chancellor had been only talking about the previous tax year - 2010-11.  Then, the Osborne family finances weren't so rosy. He started the year as an opposition front bencher, he had yet to rent out his family home, and it is suggested there may have been no dividend payment from the shares in his family's firm.  So in 2010-11 he paid the 40p rate.  The source says this was made clear in the press at the time. And, taken together, all the changes he has made in Budgets over the years may well have left him worse off.  But some Today programme listeners hearing the chancellor the morning after his 2012 Budget might just have been left with the impression that he wasn't set to gain from cutting the top rate of tax when he was.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36024720	Ministers trying to 'dismantle' public appointments system	Ministers are seeking to "dismantle" the existing system for making senior appointments to public bodies, a former top civil servant has claimed.  Sir David Normington said plans to allow ministers to choose people deemed unsuitable by advisers were "worrying".  The former Commissioner for Public Appointments said the role risked being reduced to that of a "bystander".  Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock said appointments had to be speeded up and ministers fully engaged.  Officials said changes stemming from a review by the businessman Sir Gerry Grimstone would strengthen current procedures and that transparency and accountability would remain "key elements".  It comes amid reports of increasing intervention by ministers over appointments to key positions, including on behalf of those with links to the Conservative Party.  Sir David, who retired from the role of Commissioner last week after five years, told MPs that the current system allowed departmental ministers to choose their preferred candidate from a selection of people judged "appointable" by an advisory panel.  However, the former permanent secretary at the Home Office said the government was considering allowing ministers to ignore the panels' recommendations and choose candidates from "below the line".  Ministers would also, he said, be able to appoint without an open competition without first seeking the approval of the Commissioner.  "I am absolutely clear that these are ministerial appointments and ministers must choose," he told the Commons Public Administration Committee. "There is absolutely no question about this."  But he said he was worried that the "good intentions and principles" espoused by ministers about ensuring appointment on merit and robust safeguards were not being "carried through" in the government's proposals.  "It looks like there is an intention to allow ministers to say 'well I know the committee did not approve that person but actually we think they ought to be appointed'.  "I am not quite sure about the practicalities of that. I don't think I would want to be someone who the panel had said was not suitable and the minister then appointed. That looks a very difficult proposition."  He said the proposed changes, in the round, looked "like a very big shift in the direction of ministers".  "The thing that worries me is that it dismantles the current system. I am very concerned about it. I almost never speak out publicly on these matters but I am very concerned about this."  Sir David is due to be succeeded in the role by Peter Riddell, a former political journalist who has been head of the Institute for Government.  Asked about how the role - which was created in 1995 - may change in future in light of the government's proposed changes, Sir David said. "I am a little fearful about what may happen here. I have tried in my role to head things off before they get out of hand.  "I think what may happen here is the appointment is made and the commissioner has no option to pop up and say the appointment is not acceptable."  Activist websites such as ConservativeHome have been urging Conservative supporters to apply for key public appointments, arguing Whitehall has been dominated for the past two decades by those with a New Labour background and outlook on the role of the state.  The government has said political activity should not be a bar to being considered for public appointments but candidates would be expected to be open about "significant" levels of party involvement or support.  Sir Gerry Grimstone, the chair of Standard Life, told MPs that ministers were sovereign but "appropriate constraints" on their behaviour were written into the rules - which he said were designed to secure the best and most diverse appointments.  "I have given the Commissioner very strong powers of intervention," he said.  Mr Hancock. who has ministerial responsibility for the civil service, said the current system of public appointments was "much too bureaucratic, unclear and too slow", with "good people being put off" as a result.  "We need to improve the system because my ultimate goal is to get the very best people we can," he told MPs  He said the Commissioner's role, as it was originally envisaged, was as a "regulator and auditor of the process not someone actually running the process" and the Grimstone review had clarified this.  The Cabinet Office has said ministers must be free to reject advice from their advisory panels on the merit of candidates.  In such cases, the recruitment process would either by re-run with a new panel or ministers would be able to choose someone themselves as long as they "explain their decision publicly".  The proposed changes will be incorporated in a governance code, setting out the new public appointment principles.	politics

As politicians publish their tax records, Mr Hague said great leaders were not always "perfect or normal", citing the likes of Churchill and Pitt.  Greater transparency was here to stay, he told the BBC, but it needs to be matched by a maturity of public debate.  His comments come after a row over the prime minister's financial affairs.  David Cameron took the unprecedented step of releasing a summary of his tax return last week, following days of questions and speculation about his financial affairs after revelations about his holding in his late father's offshore fund.  Chancellor George Osborne, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Boris Johnson became the latest senior British politicians to publish details of their tax returns on Monday.  Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "we live in an age of greater transparency" and "the answer is not to fight that age, it has arrived and it will come all the more".  But he said a "mature acceptance" was needed by the public that someone's personal finances will not necessarily determine their leadership abilities.  "The consequence of greater transparency in tax, in medical records whatever else it may be among leaders is that there has to be a maturity in the public debate about those things and a recognition that the circumstances and habits of people who are effective leaders will vary greatly.  "And that those personal circumstances are not necessarily a good guide to how good they will be as a prime minister, a chancellor or anything else," he said.  Downing Street have accused the media of fuelling the "frenzy over tax" surrounding the prime minister's financial affairs.  Sources have criticised the media for "misreporting" Mr Cameron's tax arrangements.  A No 10 source acknowledged Downing Street had made mistakes but said the row had also been driven by the "explosive claim" that Mr Cameron's late father's offshore fund - Blairmore - had been set up to avoid tax.  The source said: "For a number of days the media wrongly gave the clear impression that Blairmore was set up so people could avoid tax - an explosive claim that fuelled the furore.  "It was only the sheer weight of expert opinion saying this was nonsense that eventually demolished this claim. The media's misreporting of Blairmore's 'tax avoidance' contributed to last week's frenzy over tax."  Privately figures in Downing Street are particularly critical of the BBC over its coverage - and claim the corporation too easily allowed critics to suggest Mr Cameron was engaged in tax avoidance.  Mr Hague said previous leaders, such as William Pitt the Younger, had "chaotic personal finances" but were "brilliant at handling the nation's finances".  And he added: "We've had leaders who had tax returns like (Winston) Churchill that would have been more difficult to defend in public than Prime Minister David Cameron's tax returns - but Churchill was the greatest leader of modern times.  "So we're going to have to bear those things in mind and not expect everybody to be perfect or everybody to be normal."  He said suggested increased transparency should be tested in "careful stages" rather than forcing all MPs to publish their tax returns.  He warned: "If Parliament consisted of people who had the simplest possible personal finances, perhaps all having come through the public sector with no questions of business ownership or dividends... then you would have a very one dimensional Parliament."  The prime minister released a summary of earnings and tax going back six years after being accused by Labour of misleading the public over money he had invested in his father Ian Cameron's company, Blairmore Holdings.  David Cameron is currently chairing the first Cabinet meeting since the row erupted, having robustly defended his conduct and that of his father in the Commons on Monday.  But Labour is continuing to press him to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister and are questioning why the original investment was not disclosed in the register of MPs' interests.	politics

They come in the wake of the PIP implant scandal, where nearly 50,000 women in the UK were given substandard breast implants.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36013627	Clampdown on cosmetic surgery cowboys	The body that regulates UK doctors is bringing in new guidelines for cosmetic procedures to stop rogue practitioners who put profits before patients.  The General Medical Council rules, coming into force in June for private clinics and the NHS, make it clear that patients must not be rushed or cajoled into having surgery.  Doctors who break the rules could be struck off the medical register.  The surgeon or practitioner who is carrying out the cosmetic procedure - be that a breast implant, face lift or botox injections - must fully explain the risks of any procedure and should make sure patients know who to contact if they experience any complications, say the guidelines.  They are in response to a review of the industry in 2013 by Prof Sir Bruce Keogh which found few safeguards for patients, particularly for those undergoing non-surgical cosmetic procedures such as dermal fillers.  "In fact, a person having a non-surgical cosmetic intervention has no more protection and redress than someone buying a ballpoint pen or a toothbrush," his report to government concluded.  The GMC says most doctors who do cosmetic procedures do so at a high standard "but we do sometimes come across poor practice, and it is important that patients are protected from this and that doctors understand what is expected from them".  The GMC has been working with the Royal College of Surgeons of England, which is launching its own set of professional standards for cosmetic surgeons.  The RCS is also calling on the government to introduce new legislation at the next Queen's Speech in May to make sure surgeons are certified to carry out cosmetic operations.  It is hoped the measures will put an end to botched and unethical procedures.  Victoria Ashton, a mum from Leeds, had breast implants in 2008 that she later found out might be faulty with a high risk of rupturing in the body. She's now part of a campaign group for the 47,000 UK women similarly affected by the PIP implant scandal.  She believes the guidelines should help consumers, but says the public needs to be more aware of the potential risks of surgery.  "Think twice," she said. "Profit before people is basically our experience of the cosmetic surgery industry. They are all lovely to you in the process of having your operations.  "As soon as your operation is over and done with and you are out of the period in which they look after you, they don't really want to know."	health

Here's what has been released so far:  The prime minister published a summary of his tax returns from 2009 to 2015 in an attempt to defuse a row over his personal finances.  The document showed Mr Cameron's mother had given him a £200,000 gift after his father's death, which could potentially avoid inheritance tax.  Last year, the prime minister paid almost £76,000 in tax on an income of more than £200,000.  Those earnings included almost £47,000 from a share of rent paid on his family home in west London, vacated when the Camerons moved to Downing Street.  Downing Street is providing no details about the £72,000 the Mr Cameron received for selling "other shares" beyond his investment in his father's Blairmore Holdings fund or the £40,000 he received in cash from his own stock-broking account.  The following day, details of the chancellor's income were released on the government's website.  It showed he had paid £72,210 in tax in 2014-15 on a total taxable income of £198,738.  His income included £33,562 in rental income on his London home and £44,647 in dividend income from shares in his father's wallpaper company.  He also received just £3 in bank interest.  Just after Mr Osborne, as Mr Cameron's Commons statement got under way, the Labour leader released his own tax return for 2014-15.  It showed he had declared £1,850 of taxable income on top of his parliamentary salary.  Explaining the delay in releasing the document - he had promised it "very soon" two days earlier - Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had had to ask HM Revenue & Customs for a copy.  It also emerged Mr Corbyn had been fined £100 for submitting the document after the deadline.  The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, published his return - showing earnings of £61,575 and tax of £14,253 - in January, during a row over Google's tax settlement.  Scotland's first minister has published her tax return for 2014-15, promising to do so every year.  She followed Scotland's other political leaders in releasing the information. Scottish Labour's Kezia Dugdale released her returns on Saturday, and was followed by Tory Ruth Davidson. SNP leader Ms Sturgeon and Willie Rennie, of the Lib Dems, then published their documents the following day.  Leaders of Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats have revealed their tax details, with party chiefs in the Welsh Conservatives and Welsh Labour vowing to do the same.  Plaid leader Leanne Wood became the first Welsh political leader to make her tax details public, on Sunday evening.  The self-assessment tax calculation shows she paid £9,043 income tax on taxable income of £38,547.  The London mayor released figures showing he has paid more than £1m in tax in the past four years on his earnings from publishing and journalism, as well as his mayoral salary.  In 2014-15, he recorded £266,667 for his Daily Telegraph column and £224,617 in book royalties, his accounts show.  The two favourites to replace Mr Johnson in City Hall, Zac Goldsmith and Sadiq Khan, published their details in February.  Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg has predicted all MPs will be publishing their tax figures within two years, reflecting changes in the "public mood" over tax transparency.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has promised to publish his,  Among those to have already done so are Labour's former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, who published a scanned copy of his tax return for 2014-15, and ex-minister Caroline Flint who released figures for her total income and expenditure.  Downing Street said Mr Cameron thought it right for prime ministers, "potential prime ministers", chancellors and shadow chancellors to publish their tax details.  But Mr Cameron said he did not think all MPs should be compelled to routinely publish similar information.  Another Conservative MP, Charles Walker, said there was "a new culture of bullying" in the UK and warned of a situation where public figures could end up having to release a stream of personal information such as medical records.  And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he wouldn't be divulging any details, since most people regarded tax as a private matter.  "Neighbours would hate the thought that the people at Number 32 knew what their income was," he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35995741	In Quotes: What David Cameron has said about tax	David Cameron has published details of his total earnings since 2009 and the tax paid on them in the wake of a row over profits he made from an offshore investment fund set up by his late father.  He is the first prime minister to make details of his financial affairs public in this way, prompting calls for other politicians to follow suit.  But what has he had to say about tax avoidance - which is legal - and tax evasion - which is illegal - in recent years?  April 2012: Sources close to the prime minister said Mr Cameron was "relaxed about the idea of the tax returns of senior cabinet ministers being published - but wants the opportunity to explore how this might work".  January 2015: "I am very relaxed about publishing these things. There's no secrets about my status. I am paid very handsomely as your prime minister and that's my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street and I rent that out and I get income from that. I don't have other sources of income. There will be no surprises in terms of my tax affairs."  April 2016: "I will be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but the years gone past because I want to be completely open and transparent about these things. I will be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that and I think it is the right thing to do."  June 2012: Responding to media coverage of Jimmy Carr's tax arrangements amid claims the comedian was among a number of high-profile figures using legal but aggressive tax avoidance vehicles, Mr Cameron said:  "Frankly some of these schemes where people are parking huge amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimise their tax rates is not morally acceptable.  "Some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong. People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets.  "He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."  June 2013: Announcing that the US, UK and other G8 members had agreed to a series of tax transparency agreements following a summit in Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron said:  "Let me commend Britain's NGOs and charities for the campaigning work they have done for years on campaigning against tax secrecy, campaigning for openness, campaigning for transparency in extractive industries.  "This is a cause I have long espoused and have long believed in.  "The declaration says that tax authorities across the world automatically share information, that companies should know who owns them, tax collectors and law enforcers should be able to get this information easily.  "These are really strong commitments that have never been written down in this sort of way and then signed. This is words on a page that the G8 is going to be judged on year after year after year."  June 2013: Announcing that the UK had reached an agreement with the UK's Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies to sign up to a tax evasion clampdown, Mr Cameron said:  "It is important we are getting our house in order. It is a very positive step forward and it means that Britain's voice in the G8, and campaigning on this issue around the world for proper taxes, proper companies, proper laws... will be stronger."  June 2013: Speaking at an event highlighting the damage that tax evasion does to global trade and developing countries, Mr Cameron said:  "The extraordinary thing about this tax, transparency and trade agenda is that it's not just the right thing for us to do morally it's right for our economies too.  "Because when some businesses don't pay their taxes, it corrodes public trust. When some companies don't play by the rules, that drives more regulation and makes it harder for other businesses to turn a profit...  "It means getting companies to report to tax authorities where they earn their profits and where they pay their tax. It also means transparency about who owns which companies and who benefits from it - so called beneficial ownership.  "Why? Because some people use complicated and fake structures to hide their profits and avoid taxes."	politics

The hope is that time could be saved by matching patients with the most effective treatment for their cancer.  A study of the metabolic imaging technique is taking place at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.  Experts say it could lead to more personalised treatments for cancer patients.  The technique uses a product called pyruvate, which is injected into patients and tracked as it enters cells around the body.  Because it is labelled with a non-radioactive form of carbon, the molecule is very easy to detect in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.  The scan monitors how quickly pyruvate is broken down by cancer cells - and that gives doctors an idea of how active those cells still are.  And the more active the cancer cells, the less effective the drug used to kill them.  In this way, cancer can be detected quickly and the effects of drug therapies can be monitored at an early stage, potentially saving patients time on drugs that don't work.  The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute is the first place to test the technique on patients outside North America.  Dr Ferdia Gallagher, honorary consultant radiologist at the University of Cambridge, said studies on animals had shown promising results and it was time to try the technique out on humans.  "This new technique could potentially mean that doctors will find out much more quickly if a treatment is working for their patient instead of waiting to see if a tumour shrinks," he said.  This would normally take weeks or months to discover, he said.  There could also be side-effects from the wrong treatment, which he said could be avoided, as well as money wasted on expensive cancer drugs which are not effective.  Dr Emma Smith, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: "The next steps for this study will be collecting and analysing the results to find out if this imaging technology provides an accurate early snapshot of how well drugs destroy tumours."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35973174	Mental health deaths under-reported, says charity	A charity for bereaved families is demanding the government investigates the way deaths of young people in mental health units are recorded.  Research by Inquest suggests at least nine young people have died in England as in-patients since 2010.  Health Minister Alistair Burt told BBC Panorama he didn't know the figure and is calling for further research.  The Department of Health has now accepted there have been at least four deaths.  Since the interview with Panorama, Mr Burt, the minister for community and social care for England, has issued a statement saying: "Panorama's investigation has unearthed questions about record-keeping and I'm seeking assurances from NHS England that they have the right processes in place for recording any such death and that lessons are learned."  The department also says it wants to meet Inquest to resolve the discrepancy in the figures.  Inquest director Deborah Coles said: "My fear is there could be more deaths. Neither we nor the Department of Health knows."  In a parliamentary answer last year, Mr Burt suggested there had been only one such death recorded by the Care Quality Commission. His predecessor, Norman Lamb, said there had been none.  The Department of Health says NHS England has recorded four deaths of young people "in an in-patient setting".  Inquest aims to support people bereaved by a death in custody or detention, including psychiatric in-patients.  Through their own casework and Freedom of Information requests, Inquest discovered at least nine young people have died in mental health units and the true number could be higher.  The only certainty is that current reporting of deaths is confused and incomplete. The NHS places nearly half of all its young psychiatric patients in private psychiatric units and these are not subject to FoI requests.  And the Care Quality Commission, cited by the the Department of Health as collecting accurate data, is only notified of the deaths of young people who have been committed to hospital or sectioned.  This omits the deaths of voluntary patients, who make up a large part of the hospital population.  Calling for statutory notification and an independent investigation when a child dies in a mental health unit, Ms Coles said: "How on earth can we learn if we don't know the true picture and circumstances?  "If a child dies in prison, an independent investigation follows automatically. There isn't that independent scrutiny given to these deaths."  Inquest says in the absence of any centralised recording of child deaths it analysed the responses to 238 Freedom of Information requests to NHS Trusts, private providers, local safeguarding children boards, local councils, the Department for Education, the Department of Health and the Care Quality Commission.  Ms Coles said: "What's been really shocking is how difficult it is to find the true picture of the number of children dying in psychiatric care."

In a first for a UK prime minister, Mr Cameron has released a summary of his tax returns from 2009-15 as he tries to defuse a row over his finances.  The two £100,000 payments were made a year after the PM inherited £300,000 from his father in 2010, papers show.  Ministers said he'd done nothing wrong but Labour said questions remained.  Meanwhile, Mr Cameron is to make a statement to MPs on Monday on government measures to tackle tax evasion.  In the past six years, Mr Cameron earned a total of almost £1.1m and paid about £400,000 in income tax, according to the three-page summary.  Last year, he paid almost £76,000 in tax on an income of more than £200,000. Those earnings included almost £47,000 from a share of rent paid on his family home in west London.  Downing Street is providing no details about the £72,000 the PM received for selling "other shares" beyond his investment in his Blairmore Holdings fund or the £40,000 he received in cash from his stockbroking account.  The payments by Mary Cameron to her son in May and July 2011 were given tax free, and will only become liable to inheritance tax of up to 40% if she dies within seven years of handing over the money.  Downing Street said the payments were an attempt to "balance" the sums received by all the Cameron children, as Mr Cameron's older brother had inherited the family home.  Mr Corbyn said Mr Cameron needed to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister in 2010, when he sold off shares in his late father's offshore investment fund for a £19,000 profit.  "I want to see the papers," Mr Corbyn told the Andrew Marr show.  "We need to know what he's actually returned as a tax return. We need to know why he put this money overseas in the first place, and whether he made anything out of it or not before 2010 when he became prime minister. These are questions that he must answer."  Asked about the £200,000 gift Mr Cameron received from his mother, the Labour leader said there was "possibly" a case for looking at inheritance tax rules.  He said: "It does actually reduce the level of inheritance tax that is available for the Exchequer as a whole."  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister had "effectively inherited £500,000 from his mum and dad and not paid a penny on it," which, he said, showed there was "something wrong with the system".  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has, meanwhile, published her tax return for 2014/15, and committed to publishing it annually for as long as she is First Minister. It shows she earned £104,817, and paid more than £31,000 in tax.  Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale was the first Scottish party leader to publish her tax returns, on Saturday, and was swiftly followed Ms Sturgeon, the Conservatives's Ruth Davidson and Lib Dem Willie Rennie.  Inheritance tax is paid if a person's estate (their property, money and possessions) is worth more than £325,000 when they die. The rate is 40% on anything above the threshold.  Married couples and civil partners are allowed to pass their possessions and assets to each other tax-free.  The deceased's estate may not have to pay inheritance tax on assets the deceased gave away as gifts while they were alive. The original owner must live for seven years after giving the gift.  One person's tax planning is another person's tax avoidance - so whether David Cameron's tax affairs are controversial or not is really a matter of where you stand on the payment of tax.  Most tax accountants would advise a wealthy family on "gifts" - payments of money - to their children and how to ensure they are not liable for inheritance tax by making payments in tranches to avoid breaching tax thresholds.  Mr Cameron's family appear to have done this, and Downing Street says the payments were made by the prime minister's mother to "even out" the inheritance payments made to her children following her husband's death. Not to avoid tax.  Mr Corbyn, who has promised to publish his own tax returns "very soon", also suggested Britain needed to be "much more assertive" on the question of overseas arrangements in the UK's overseas territories and asked why Britain was "encouraging" tax havens.  And he said greater openness around tax affairs might be expected from all those in public life, not just MPs, in future, saying: "I think we're moving in that direction".  The SNP are, meanwhile, calling on Mr Cameron to publish a financial statement on all government ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne, revealing whether they have benefited from offshore tax havens.  A Treasury source said: "We have been clear that the chancellor has never had any offshore shareholdings or other interests.  "His income and interests are straightforward and declared publicly: his salary, rental income from a property in London and a shareholding in his father's firm, Osborne and Little.  "He is always happy to consider ways to offer even more transparency."  Energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd defended the prime minister on the Andrew Marr show, saying Mr Cameron had "said all there is to be said" about his tax affairs, having taken the "unprecedented step" of publishing details.  She said Mr Cameron and his family had done nothing wrong and had paid the correct amount of tax due, adding that going after tax havens had been a "key priority" for the government since 2010.  Mr Cameron has also announced a new task force to investigate tax-dodging allegations arising from the leak of 11 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, known as the Panama Papers.  The prime minister was dragged into the controversy when it emerged his late father's investment fund, Blairmore, was a client of the firm.  Downing Street issued a series of statements over four days as pressure on Mr Cameron mounted before he finally admitted he had benefited from the fund.  On Saturday, he admitted he could have better handled the row over his financial affairs, telling people to "blame me" for the slow response, not Downing Street officials.  He said he was publishing the information on his income to be "completely open and transparent".  The prime minister's salary was steady at £142,500 from 2010 to 2015, but there were tax variations due to treatment of his pension contributions and the different approaches to his £20,000 tax-free allowance.  In terms of rent earned on the Notting Hill house, Mr Cameron's 50% share, minus expenses, was £45,041 in 2011-12, £46,700 in 2012-13, £47,764 in 2013-14 and £46,899 last year.  The new tax task force announced by Mr Cameron will have initial funding of £10m and involve staff from the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority as well as HMRC and the NCA.  The government said the agencies had leading technology, experts and resources to tackle money laundering and tax evasion.  Mr McDonnell said proposals for the task force to report to the chancellor and home secretary were "unacceptable".  "Any inquiry must be fully independent and in public," he said.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36009645	Tax row: Labour plan to 'clean out' offshore havens	Labour has set out a series of measures it claims will "stop the super-rich hiding their wealth" in tax havens.  They include forcing transparency standards on UK overseas territories and a register of offshore trusts.  The party has called for a public inquiry into alleged abuses uncovered in leaked documents from a Panama law firm - and vowed not to accept donations linked to tax avoidance.  The government has set up a task force to look into the Panama Papers.  And the prime minister has taken the unprecedented step of publishing details of his tax and income over the past six years following Labour claims he had misled the public over whether he had benefitted from an offshore fund.  David Cameron will also host an international anti-corruption summit in London next month - and the government is to publish a register of beneficial ownership, revealing who ultimately gains from shadowy shell companies used to avoid tax.  But Labour argue Mr Cameron should publish his full tax returns and say the government's £10m task force must be "fully independent and in public".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "After a week of half-truths and spin from this government in the wake of the revelations in the Panama Papers leak, it's time to clean out the tax havens with real government action.  "It should be a matter of shame to the British government that more than half the companies recently named in the Panama Papers were registered in UK-governed tax havens.  "Not only has this government impeded international efforts to crack down on tax avoidance and to tackle tax havens but senior figures are personally implicated in these immoral schemes."  Labour also questioned a letter Mr Cameron wrote to EU officials in 2013, which called for offshore trusts to be excluded from a crackdown on tax avoidance.  The government said Mr Cameron had felt forcing trusts to reveal who gained financially from them would "distract" from action in more pressing areas.  But Mr McDonnell said: "It is deeply concerning that our prime minister has still failed to clarify whether or not he or his family were benefiting directly or indirectly in 2013 when he was lobbying to prevent EU measures to better regulate trusts as a way to clamp down on tax avoidance."  The shadow chancellor also promised that Labour would reject any donations linked to tax avoidance.  Political donations made by individuals are not tax-deductible in the UK - but money left in wills to major parties is not subject to inheritance tax.  Labour accepted a £1.65m donation in shares in 2013, from home shopping magnate John Mills, which he said at the time was a more "tax efficient" way of donating to the party than giving cash.  Quizzed about the Mills donation on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr McDonnell said: "Every penny that comes in to us will open and transparent.  "We will not be touching money that is used by any way in measures to avoid tax or evade tax, we will not allow that to happen and we're not allowing that to happen."  Mr McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have also suggested that the inheritance tax system is in need of reform to make it "fairer".  Mr McDonnell told Pienaar's Politics: "I don't personalise politics, this is about the system, and a system whereby someone can inherit, effectively, £500,000 from his mum and dad and not pay a penny on it, I think there's something wrong in the system that allows that to happen."  But Housing minister Brandon Lewis pointed out that the gift from Mrs Cameron to her son was no different from similar arrangements used in other families, it was just a "larger sum of money".  Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested the current 40% inheritance tax rate, which kicks in at £135,000, should be "graded" so the wealthiest families pay more.	politics

Writing in the Observer, Sir Bruce Keogh said the planned walkout in England on 26 and 27 April would put significant strain on services.  Action in the row over a new contract has not affected emergency care so far.  The British Medical Association said disruption was avoidable if the government agreed to return to talks.  Ministers, however, are refusing to reopen discussions, arguing they made compromises earlier in the year but the BMA did not.  A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the strike was "disproportionate... damaging and unnecessary".  The fourth strike in the dispute ran for for 48 hours from 08:00 BST on 6 April. Junior doctors did not provide routine care and about 5,000 operations and procedures were postponed.  The strikes later this month will be escalated to include all forms of care including emergencies.  In his article, Sir Bruce says "junior doctors will be grappling with their consciences" as the new strike date approaches.  "This is a watershed moment for the NHS - and a difficult time for the medical profession," he writes.  Sir Bruce does note that junior doctors feel disengaged and powerless and that all parties have a responsibility to solve the "underlying issues".  He says: "The current unrest is not just about contracts, but is the culmination of growing frustration over many years about the difficult conditions in which junior doctors work and train, and about the way they are treated and valued by the multitude of organisations that constitute the NHS...  "Whatever the rights and wrongs of this complex dispute, this is a very serious state of affairs."  The new action, says Sir Bruce, will put additional significant strain on A&E, intensive care and maternity services, particularly in smaller hospitals.  "I worry that the withdrawal of emergency cover will put our sickest, most vulnerable patients at greater risk."  He calls on doctors to "dig deep" and ask whether the action is fair to patients or compatible with the values and privilege of the profession.  The BMA urged the government to get back round the table and end the dispute through talks, reiterating that senior doctors would provide emergency care on the strike days.  It disputes the government's assertion that changes to doctors' contracts, which will see them paid less for working weekends while basic pay is increased, are needed to improve care at weekends.  The union's junior doctors' leader, Dr Johann Malawana, tells the Observer: "No junior doctor wants to take this action but we have been left with no choice.  "We regret any disruption caused to patients and have given trusts enough notice for them to plan ahead.  "It is disappointing that Bruce Keogh is attacking front-line doctors rather than echoing calls, from patients' groups to senior NHS managers, for the government to get back around the table and end this dispute through talks."  Mr Hunt's spokesman said: "Withdrawing emergency care poses huge risks to patient safety and will be very difficult for the consultants, nurses and other allied health professionals who will be stretched to provide cover.  "This action is disproportionate, so we urge the BMA to call their damaging and unnecessary strike off."	health

Addressing the Tories' spring forum, he said he was to blame for the handling of revelations about his holding in his late father's offshore fund.  Days after questions were first raised, the PM admitted this week he had owned and later sold units in the fund.  Mr Cameron also said he would publish information on his tax returns later.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he "looked forward" to that publication.  BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the decision to publish the tax returns would keep the prime minister's finances in the headlines.  But Downing Street felt the only way to move forward was by confronting the issue head on with an unprecedented level of detail, our correspondent said, adding however that Labour was in no mood to let the row drop.  Hundreds of protesters calling on Mr Cameron to "close tax loopholes or resign" rallied outside Downing Street on Saturday, some moving on to demonstrate outside the venue where the Conservative forum was held.  Addressing Conservative Party activists at the central London forum, Mr Cameron said: "It has not been a great week. I know that I should have handled this better, I could have handled this better.  "I know there are lessons to learn and I will learn them.  Mr Cameron said: "I was obviously very angry about what people were saying about my dad. I loved my dad, I miss him every day.  "He was a wonderful father and I'm very proud of everything he did. But I mustn't let that cloud the picture. The facts are these: I bought shares in a unit trust, shares that are like any other sorts of shares and I paid taxes on them in exactly the same way.  "I sold those shares. In fact, I sold all the shares that I owned, on becoming prime minister."  Mr Cameron continued: "Later on I will be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but the years gone past because I want to be completely open and transparent about these things.  "I will be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that and I think it is the right thing to do."  Revelations about Mr Cameron's financial affairs followed a leak of 11 million documents this month held by Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.  The documents, known collectively as the Panama Papers, revealed that Mr Cameron's late father Ian had been a client of Mossack Fonseca when establishing a fund for investors.  Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for an "open and public" inquiry into the revelations.  This mea culpa by the prime minister is solely on how the questions about his tax affairs have been handled, not on his decision to hold shares in his late father's offshore firm.  David Cameron remains adamant that he did not break any rules and that his father's Bahamas-based business had not been established for the purpose of avoiding tax.  But he is well aware that taking several days to confirm that he used to hold shares has allowed his political opponents to accuse him of "misleading" the public.  And so in an attempt to show he has nothing to hide, he will publish "information" from his tax returns.  That may or may not take some heat out of the row, depending on what the "information" actually is. But politically, a lot of damage has already been done.  When David Cameron refers to taking personal responsibility, he is seeking to shield his closest advisers in Downing Street, who some sections of the press - and even one or two Conservatives - have been criticising for the prime minister's flawed response.  Protesters at a demonstration in central London waved placards and chanted slogans criticising tax avoidance.  Downing Street protest organiser, journalist Abi Wilkinson, told BBC Radio 5 live the week's revelations raised questions about Mr Cameron's commitment to tackling tax avoidance.  "But the thing that really made us think we had to get out and protest was the news that, in 2013 when the EU were trying to crack down on offshoring and tax avoidance, he stepped in and actually weakened what they were trying to do," she said.  Meanwhile, Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the issue was, "not about an individual, not about one person, one family, it's about a whole ethos where the very rich are able to put their money into tax havens, offshore accounts".  "That is money that is being made that is untaxed and doesn't contribute anything to the need of public services."  Mr Corbyn said he would publish his own tax returns "very, very soon, when I've got the papers together".  Commons leader Chris Grayling said those accusing Mr Cameron of misleading the public were making a "mountain out of a mole hill".  At the Conservative spring forum, Mr Cameron said local elections in England and mayoral contests in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford on 5 May gave voters a clear choice between "Tory competence and the disarray of the rest".  Only Tory councils could be trusted to keep taxes low while "getting things done" and "delivering more for less", he said.  The Conservatives are defending about 880 seats last contested in 2012.  More than 2,700 seats in 124 councils across England are up for grabs next month in what will be Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's first national test in England at the ballot box.	politics

The vote on 5 May is a clear choice between "Tory competence and the disarray of the rest", he said.  The prime minister argued council tax had fallen in real terms since 2010 as town halls gained budgetary freedoms.  The Conservatives are defending about 880 seats last contested in 2012.  More than 2,700 seats in 124 councils across England are up for grabs next month in what will be Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's first national test in England at the ballot box.  Labour did well the last time the majority of the seats were contested in 2012, while the Conservatives - who are the largest party in local government but are fighting their first set of council elections as a majority government for 20 years - lost about 300 seats.  The government has been accused of giving local authorities no option but to cut services such as as libraries, children's centres and bus routes by slashing the value of the Whitehall grant to councils over the past five years.  Mr Cameron has clashed with the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire County Council, which covers his Witney constituency, over whether councils are doing enough to cut their operating costs and make efficiency savings as a way of protecting core services.  Speaking at the Conservatives' Spring Forum, Mr Cameron urged voters to focus on Tory councils' record of "getting things done" while "delivering more for less".  "These local elections provide a clear choice - the competence of a strong Conservative council who will keep taxes down with quality local services, against the disarray of the rest," he said.  The Conservatives say council tax has risen by an average of 6% since 2010 - lower than the rate of inflation - because of the funding it has given to councils to cover a freeze in rates.  Mr Cameron argued the decision to allow councils to retain 100% of their business rates by 2020 was evidence of a bold, reforming government that was willing to trust local communities and give them a direct stake in economic growth.  He also defended a series of controversial policies - such as giving all social housing tenants the right to buy their own home, turning all schools into academies by 2022 and making the NHS a "truly" seven-day service - as evidence of a government doing "big things".  "A Conservative government could be proud of achieving any one of those things in one term. We are doing them all."  In her speech, Home Secretary Theresa May said councils had new powers and voting on 5 May would decide how billions of pounds would be raised and spent.  "A vote for a Conservative is a vote for a local authority that respects the council tax payer and works hard for them," she said.  "Conservative councils have innovated to turn back the tide on the years when Labour let council tax double and services stagnate."  Labour has suggested its councils are being targeted in the latest round of spending cuts, which will see average funding fall by 6.7% by 2020. This comes on top of a nearly 30% reduction in Whitehall grants between 2010 and 2015.  They also argue councils in poorer areas could also lose out from the business rate changes.  Also in England on 5 May there are elections for a new mayor in London as well as Bristol, Liverpool and Salford. The elections are taking place seven weeks before June's referendum on the UK's future membership of the EU.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35988623	What will President Obama's cancer 'moonshot' achieve?	In January, US President Barack Obama announced a "moonshot" for cancer.  "Let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all," he said in his last State of the Nation address.  President Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of mission control. For Mr Biden it's personal - he lost his son Beau to brain cancer at the age of 46 last year.  The cancer moonshot is a $1bn (£710m) injection of cash intended to bring a decade's worth of advances in just five years.  It is focusing on new approaches such as combining treatments and immunotherapy, when drugs make the patient's own immune system turn against cancer cells.  There will also be more resources for new gene technologies to improve cancer detection. A further area of research is into more vaccines to prevent cancer.  Mr Biden sees his role as breaking down walls and bringing all the cancer fighters together.  Today many hospitals do not share data. Doctors don't always know about the latest successful therapies.  "We're going to make sure this information is shared so an oncologist in Austin, Texas can get access to information at MD Anderson, a major cancer institute [at the University of Texas] where my son was treated - geographically close but no access," said Mr Biden earlier this year.  There have been considerable improvements in recent decades in some cancer treatments. Thirty years ago patients with a cancer diagnosis had a one in four chance of surviving for more than 10 years.  Now that figure is close to one in two.  "Underlying that general picture, it's a very mixed story," says Prof Nic Jones of Manchester University and research lead for Cancer Research UK. "In testicular cancer and breast cancer tremendous progress has been made. But in lung, pancreatic and brain cancer really very little progress has been made.  "We really need to focus our research effort on these areas."  A combination of targeted treatments, better and earlier diagnosis and more precise surgery and radiotherapy has led to longer survival. Changing lifestyles, such as giving up smoking, has also made a difference.  Immunotherapy is starting to make an impact, but only on a few patients.  Adrian Webb is one of the lucky ones. In 2012, he noticed that he had a mole that had changed colour.  It turned out to be a malignant melanoma.  After initial treatment, the disease returned and this time it had spread. He was given a year to live.  His doctor at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham gave him a chance to be in a clinical trial of immunotherapy.  "After 12 months I was told that I was part of the 5% team. The therapy hadn't worked for the other 95%," he said.  The cancer had shrunk remarkably to a small part of Mr Webb's lung. He is now well enough to run marathons.  There are still considerable challenges for cancer researchers and doctors to discover successful and safe treatments. We do not have magic bullets.  Prof Jones says: "Cancer is the most complex disease that we know of. Every individual is unique in the changes that have occurred to give cancer. We need to understand cancer at a molecular level to develop more accurate treatments."  The new immunotherapy treatments are very expensive, everywhere in the world.  The associate director for cancer prevention and control at the University of Kentucky, Prof Thomas Tucker, says the cancer moonshot money could be put to better use.  "This will be valuable for pharmaceutical companies - problem is how do we pay for drugs that cost $12,000 per month in the US?"  Prof Tucker would like to see another $1bn spent on prevention. "Of 1.7 million new cases diagnosed each year in the US, at least one third could be prevented. If one third fewer people got cancer what kind of cost savings would that generate?"  Cancer Research UK is another organisation with moonshot-like aims, earmarking £100m to spend on five winning ideas to tackle some of the most important unanswered questions in cancer research.  But are campaigns like these the best way to improve cancer survival?  More than four decades ago, another American president made his own attempt.  In 1971 Richard Nixon launched what was a called a "War on Cancer" but that war is still not won.  The force behind the campaign was the socialite and philanthropist Mary Lasker.  Dr Claire Pomeroy, president of the Lasker Foundation, said the philanthropist's motivation dated back to "when she was young visiting the family's laundress who'd just had radical mastectomy for breast cancer back at a time when people didn't talk about cancer.  "She was really struck by the suffering and the hopelessness."  Ms Lasker put a whole-page advert in the Washington Post and New York Times asking President Nixon to start a war on cancer.  It had an enormous impact - and rather than cutting the cancer research budget, the president increased it.  His advisers brought in the scientists who had got men to the moon. They reckoned they could find a cure for cancer in seven years.  But curing cancer turned out to be much more complicated than putting men on the moon.  Did President Nixon's war on cancer achieve anything?  Medical historian Dr Carsten Timmermann of Manchester University says: "A lot of new findings were already under way, for example in molecular biology. For patients there were not many tangible benefits.  "There was publicity about the war on cancer. The declaration of war may have contributed to the disappearance of stigma around cancer. Disappearance of stigma helps because people go and talk to their doctors in good time."  The Cancer Moonshot Task Force will deliver its first report by 31 December. Among its findings, it will make recommendations for where funding should now be directed.  Listen to BBC Radio 4 programmes assessing the US cancer "moonshot"	health

On Thursday, the PM said he sold the shares before he entered Number 10 in 2010 and had paid all UK taxes due on profits from the £30,000 sale.  He said the firm, Blairmore Holdings, had not been set up to avoid tax.  But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the PM had "misled the public" and "lost the trust of the British people".  He said Mr Cameron's actions had showed there was "one rule for the wealthy and another for the rest of us".  "After years of calling for tax transparency and attacking complex offshore tax arrangements as 'morally wrong', the prime minister has been shown to have personally benefited from exactly such a secretive offshore investment," he said.  Mr Corbyn said the PM must give a "full account of all his private financial dealings and make a statement to Parliament next week".  He also accused the government of "connivance with tax havens and refusal to take serious action against tax avoidance and evasion", leading "directly" to public spending cuts.  Labour backbencher John Mann has called on the Commons Standards Commissioner to look into why Mr Cameron's stake in Blairmore was not disclosed in the register of MPs' financial interests.  Conservative MPs have defended Mr Cameron while Downing Street - whose handling of the issue has been criticised - has insisted the prime minister's financial interests have "always been recorded in line with the rules as they stood at the time".  There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings - a fund for investors which until 2006 used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy - following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.  Thousands of similar funds, or companies, have been set up for various reasons although, ultimately of course, their aim is to make money.  Those on one side of the argument will argue that these funds exist, and are based offshore, primarily owing to the opportunity to escape paying certain taxes.  The opposing argument is that this decision is purely based on rational business grounds, by finding a way to attract investors from around the world and for the fund to perform to its peak.  They show that Mr Cameron's father, Ian, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.  Downing Street and Mr Cameron had issued four statements on whether Mr Cameron had any financial involvement with Blairmore Holdings before the PM told ITV News on Thursday about the shares he had owned.  Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said Mr Cameron could not be blamed for his father's actions but had not been "entirely straight with the British people about what his own financial arrangements were".  "That wouldn't be so bad if he hadn't also been lecturing very prominent people about their own tax arrangements, some he called morally wrong for being invested in similar schemes," he said.  While stopping short of calling for the PM to quit, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was regrettable the information had had to be "dragged" out of him.  "You need to be able to trust your prime minister and the fact that he couldn't answer a straight question, straightforwardly, straight away I think has undermined the trust that we have in him," he said.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the prime minister had "big questions to answer" while Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said his behaviour illustrated a government that was intent on supporting a "small proportion of the establishment not acting in the national interest".  But James Quarmby, a specialist in tax planning and wealth structuring at law firm Stephenson Harwood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a "massive misunderstanding" about what Mr Cameron had invested in.  He said it was a hedge fund that was "about as boring as it gets for investments", adding that it would not be used for avoiding tax.  "It's no different from Mr Cameron investing in a UK stock," he said.  Even David Cameron himself has admitted it has been a pretty difficult week.  Downing Street has been thrown on the defensive, forced to ride out damning headlines that have dogged the prime minister day after day. There have been accusations Mr Cameron has "played the public" on his tax affairs and that he has lost the electorate's trust.  Remember, he is currently in the middle of the political fight of his life, battling to keep Britain in the European Union. He's trying to persuade voters to believe his arguments, trying to win over their trust in the referendum debate. So, the timing isn't good. Anything like this that highlights the distance between him and voters will not help.  The problem for the prime minister is political image. He hasn't done anything illegal but it is perception that matters.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the prime minister had "acted quite properly" and done everything that could be expected of him.  Speaking on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Cameron had done nothing "at all improper" and had "the fuller questions... been asked of him earlier in the week then it might all have been neater".  Conservative Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee, said Number 10 had clearly "mishandled" the issue.  "I don't know who's been advising... but it clearly would have been much better if a much cleaner breast of all the facts had been made right at the outset," he told Radio 4's World at One.  Business Minister Nick Boles said "with the benefit of hindsight" it might have been better if the PM had revealed details of his shareholdings when the allegations first surfaced on Monday but he understood Mr Cameron's "natural human instinct to rally round his father".  In his interview on Thursday, Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."  Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore was set up to avoid tax.  "It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.  Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500. That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.  The rules on members' interests state MPs must declare a company shareholding if it exceeds 15% of total shares issued or is worth more than £70,000. Holdings in collective investment vehicles such as unit trusts and investment companies with variable capital do not need to be registered.	politics

Some Tory Eurosceptics have been getting behind their leader describing the row over his personal finances as "very unseemly" and "very distasteful".  Labour MPs are keeping up the pressure with demands for Mr Cameron to come to the House of Commons next week and give a statement explaining his tax affairs.  If the PM was hoping this would all have blown over by the weekend, he's likely to be mistaken; the questions will continue to come. And with the PM's promise to publish his tax return in the coming days there'll be another opportunity for his critics to pile the pressure on again.  I think Downing Street has been left furious by events. During an unusually terse conversation with a No 10 source, I asked how they felt at the end of such a troubling week.  "Hindsight is a wonderful thing," they replied - an admission, I think, they'd do things very differently if they had the chance again.	politics

Sources told the BBC that the British Medical Association had blown its chance to negotiate and said there would be no deviation from imposition.  It means the first-ever all-out strike by junior doctors looks likely to go ahead in three weeks, with the BMA also maintaining it will not climb down.  This week's walkout, which ended at 08:00, did not involve emergency care.  But that will not be the case during the strikes on 26 and 27 April from 08:00 to 17:00, when junior doctors will walkout of A&E and intensive care. This has never happened before in the history of the NHS.  The prospect of an all-out strike has prompted a host of organisations, including the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Patients Association, to call on ministers to halt the imposition and for both sides to get back round the table.  The BMA has indicated it is willing to talk.  The union's junior doctors' leader, Dr Johann Malawana, said on Thursday: "Any future action is wholly avoidable, but the government must get back around the negotiating table and end this dispute through talks."  But government sources said there was virtually no prospect of that happening as the BMA had had its chance but had been unwilling to compromise.  They said negotiators had refused to discuss the last remaining issue - Saturday pay - when the talks at conciliation service Acas were going on at the turn of the year and without a commitment to do that, which has not been forthcoming, there would be no point resuming talks.  In a statement, the Department of Health said the government has been left with "no choice" but to push ahead with imposition.	health

Untreated, the condition can increase the risk of a stillbirth and other complications.  Most screening takes place at 28 weeks, but a University of Cambridge study of 4,069 women showed the foetus was already affected by then.  Charities said gestational diabetes was involved in a "significant number" of potentially avoidable stillbirths.  Gestational diabetes is common and affects up to 18 in every 100 pregnancies.  The extra sugar in the bloodstream acts as "baby fuel" leading to rapid growth inside the womb.  Most babies are normal and healthy but the condition increases the likelihood of a large baby, which can be difficult to deliver, suffering bone fractures.  The babies can also be at higher risks of obesity and diabetes later in life.  The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, showed excessive foetal growth had already started by the usual time of screening.  Women testing positive for gestational diabetes at that 28-week stage were twice as likely as other mothers to have an abnormally large foetus.  Mothers who were obese as well as having gestational diabetes had five times the risk of a large foetus.  Prof Gordon Smith, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "The recommendations are that screening should take place at some point between 24 and 28 weeks, but in practice a lot screen at 28 weeks.  "Our findings indicate that it should be brought forward to 24 weeks and that would still be consistent with existing guidelines.  "And we should possibly be doing a second, earlier, screening test for early onset of the disease - but that needs further research."  There were no signs of large babies at 20 weeks.  Dr Daghni Rajasingam, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "This study emphasises the importance of early detection and diagnosis.  "There is growing awareness for the need to screen earlier, but further research should assess the ideal timing of screening and the impact this has on the child's health.  "It is important to emphasise that immediate changes to lifestyle, including a healthy diet and moderate levels of exercise, can have significantly positive effects on a woman and her baby's health."  Janet Scott, from the stillbirth charity Sands, said: "We know from recent enquiries that failure to screen for gestational diabetes currently plays a part in a significant number of potentially avoidable stillbirths at term.  "Good risk assessment is crucial to avoiding harm to mothers and babies and we welcome these important findings which have real potential to inform better antenatal care for these high-risk pregnancies."	health

The PM has faced questions over Blairmore Holdings, an offshore company set up by his late father, Ian.  He told ITV News he had paid all UK taxes due on the profits he made from the sale of the shares and said the firm had not been set up to avoid tax.  Labour said the PM had been forced into the "extraordinary admission".  The BBC understands Mr Cameron will publish his tax returns, possibly next week.  There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings, a fund for investors which, until 2006, used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy, following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.  They show that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.  On Wednesday, Downing Street issued a statement saying Mr Cameron, his wife and children did not benefit from offshore funds - following a day of questions from the media about whether his family retained an interest in the fund.  On Thursday Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."  The PM said it had been a "difficult few days, reading criticisms of my father and his business practices - my dad, a man I love and admire and miss every day".  Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore Investment was set up to avoid tax.  "It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.  Mr Cameron said the fund was "properly audited" and reported to the Inland Revenue every year. Anyone who bought units in it was subject to capital gains tax when shares were sold, he said.  He said that he had owned stocks and shares in the past but sold them in 2010 shortly before he became prime minister.  "I didn't want to anyone to say you've got other agendas or vested interests," he said.  "Samantha and I had a joint account and we owned 5,000 units in Blairmore investment trust which we sold in January 2010, that was worth something like £30,000.  "I paid income tax on the dividends, but there was a profit on it, but that was less than the capital gains tax allowance, so I didn't pay capital gains tax, but it was subject to all the UK taxes in all the normal ways."  Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500. That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.  A leak of 11.5 million documents has lifted the lid on how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.  The files were leaked from one of the world's most secretive companies, a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.  Among the files are details about:  Mossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and never been accused or charged with criminal wrong-doing.  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while there was no suggestion of illegality, it would be "politically embarrassing" for Mr Cameron to be associated with a company which did not pay tax in the UK, at a time when he was trying to encourage overseas territories to be more transparent about tax and was trying to clamp down on tax havens.  Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it was an "extraordinary admission": "David Cameron, who described the use of complex tax avoidance schemes as "morally wrong", has been forced to admit that he held shares in a fund now linked to tax avoidance."  He said there would be further questions about what Mr Cameron knew about the fund: "The time has come for David Cameron to put the record straight rather than having details dragged from him in instalments."  He told BBC News: "It feels like the prime minister is governing from the shadows in this announcement today. That he's been withholding personal information that he feels personal shame about."  And SNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie MP described it as "an astounding revelation by a prime minister who has questioned the morality of using such tax-avoiding schemes".  He added: "David Cameron says he doesn't have anything to hide, yet had it not been for the Panama Papers leak we would have been none the wiser - and even then it has taken him several days to clarify he benefited from his father's off-shore trust."	politics

Board of Deputies president Jonathan Arkush attacked Mr Corbyn's "deeply disturbing" response to a tweet by his brother criticising a Jewish Labour MP.  He said Mr Corbyn could not be "inert" where abuse in the party was alleged.  Mr Corbyn said: "Anti-Semitism is vile and wrong as is any form of racism."  Labour is currently investigating allegations of anti-Semitism including in its Oxford University branch, and last month it suspended one of its members for posting anti-Semitic tweets.  After Labour MP Louise Ellman said more needed to be done and that cracking down on such behaviour was "not just about words", Mr Corbyn's brother Piers tweeted saying this was "rubbish".  He added: "All #Corbyns are committed #AntiNazi. #Zionists cant cope with anyone supporting rights for #Palestine".  According to The Sun, when asked about his brother's tweet, Mr Corbyn said: "My brother has his point of view, I have mine and we actually fundamentally agree - we are a family that were brought up fighting racism from the day we were born."  Mr Akrush said: "Jeremy Corbyn's defence of his brother's belittling of the problem of anti-Semitism is deeply disturbing.  "We cannot imagine that any other minority's concerns would be dismissed off-hand in this way."  He said there had recently been "a stream of clear-cut cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party", and that the Jewish community as well as Labour politicians were "crying out" for the leader to take action.  "It would be incomprehensible for Mr Corbyn to remain inert and refuse to take this form of racism in his party seriously," he added.  London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan recently said Mr Corbyn needed to take a "tougher stance" on tackling anti-Semitism, which he said should be a "a badge of shame" in the Labour Party.  Speaking on a visit to Norwich, Mr Corbyn said: "If anyone reports any form of anti-Semitism within our party, it is investigated immediately and cracked down upon.  "That message is unequivocal - we are a multifaith, multicultural Britain - let's respect each other and move on from there."	politics

Now a team in Manchester is using virtual reality to help patients get moving again.  Marge Brown cannot help the tears welling up in her eyes as she watches her husband stroll on a treadmill through a virtual wood he can see on the giant video screen in front of him.  Six years ago, Kenneth had a massive stroke which left his left side paralysed. Doctors told him he would never be able to walk again and advised he would be best cared for in a residential home.  "Now look at him!" says Marge with pride. "This morning he's already been sailing and now he's walking in the woods!"  Instead of accepting his doctor's advice, Kenneth stepped up his rehabilitation programme and got a referral to BASIC, the Brain and Spinal Injury Centre which is a charity based in Salford and which is affiliated to the Greater Manchester Clinical Neuroscience Centre at Salford Royal Hospital.  Kenneth was particularly keen to try BASIC's recently installed computer assisted rehabilitation environment system known as Caren, which aims to help people like him win back movement, balance and confidence.  Under the careful guidance of neuro-physiotherapist Sylvia Moss, Kenneth is strapped into a harness, and led to circular podium on a rotating chassis where he stands on the treadmill facing a cinema sized wrap-around screen.  The prow of a boat appears before him on the screen and Sylvia explains to him that he's going to feel as if he's driving that boat and that he will need to transfer his weight to move the boat around an obstacle course and that he must lean forward when he wants to pick up speed. The sound of seagulls fills the room.  "Shall we have a few sharks Ken?" asks Sylvia as the programme starts. Kenneth brightens instantly. "Oh lovely!" he says gamely. "Bring on the sharks!"  Caren might sound like an expensive funfair gimmick - it cost BASIC around £500,000 to purchase and install - but its results are promising.  Sylvia Moss says it isn't a replacement for basic physiotherapy - but it is an extremely useful additional aid.  "The Caren is able to do multifactorial things. It's able to do walking, balance, cognition and visual field as well so it enables multi-tasking.  "Many stroke patients or Parkinson's or dementia sufferers do have problems multi-tasking so this system is really good value.  "And it's safe. Ken knows he won't fall so he's more likely to push himself; in fact many patients come in determined to beat their last score so the challenge is there for them too."  Kenneth wants to try "skiing" next time which will force him to push his weight forward and use his paralysed leg.  "It's good fun," he smiles as his wife helps him into his coat. "I've had several falls since my stroke and while the gym builds muscle, the Caren builds confidence."  It was BASIC's chief executive, Wendy Edge, who first heard about the system.  She learnt that the Israeli army was using a virtual reality system to help rehabilitate injured soldiers and went to visit their brain and spinal injury hospital in Tel Aviv to see for herself.  "The research showed that using virtual reality as part of a rehabilitation process actually speeds up recovery and can reduce the impact of a brain injury, so we set about fundraising immediately."  BASIC is already conducting its own physical, cognitive and psychometric tests before and after Caren sessions, which Wendy Edge says show positive results.  Patient feedback forms wax lyrical about the "fun" of the system.  Last month BASIC also secured funding to launch a pilot project which will allow 30 people with mild to moderate forms of dementia to try the Caren system. Wendy Edge says the problem with dementia patients is they are too often "wrapped up in cotto wool," and end up isolated and dependent.  "The Caren gives people with dementia the chance to do the things they used to do in the outside world. They can be safely immersed in this futuristic world and enjoy football, exploring a castle, skiing - things they would never get the chance to do."  Driving is something else which becomes possible again with the Caren.  After a recent stroke and the diagnosis of mild dementia, Leslie is no longer allowed to drive but at least using the Caren he can still get the sensation of being on the road while concentrating on avoiding obstacles and controlling his speed through his balance.  "It's a bit exaggerated," he admits "I wouldn't drive like that on a real road - but I'm glad it isn't a real road as I had a few bad crashes today."  "I miss driving, but this gets me out of the house and it loosens me up a bit and I do look forward to coming here - I love it really."  In the waiting room grinning with excitement is 17-year-old Sophie Downes. She has been using the Caren system for a few months following a stroke which left her with weakness on her right side.  "It's like being in a film," she says "It's like really amazing! Yesterday I was really good on it and it makes me use my body a lot. My right arm has really improved."  But does it feel like she's living in a video game?  "It's better than that," she says. "It feels like real life."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222	Panama Papers: Cameron faces questions over trust letter	David Cameron is facing questions about his attempt to exclude offshore trusts from an EU crackdown on tax avoidance.  The PM wrote to EU officials in 2013 to say trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency rules as companies.  Labour said this showed he did not take tax avoidance seriously.  But the government said he had felt forcing trusts to reveal who gained financially from them would "distract" from action in more pressing areas.  Britain is set to introduce a register of beneficial ownership in an attempt to shed light on the shadowy world of offshore "shell companies" used to avoid paying tax. It will force companies to reveal who ultimately gains financially from them.  But critics have said trusts can also be used to hide wealth, with one Dutch MEP saying Britain's efforts to exclude them from transparency legislation had created a "huge loophole".  In a letter to former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy in November 2013, Mr Cameron expressed reservation about extending such regulations, designed to reduce secrecy and limit the scope for abuse, to trusts, both those registered offshore and in the UK.  The disclosure, first reported by the Financial Times, comes after days of media scrutiny of the prime minister's personal tax affairs and those of Mr Cameron's late father Ian, who it has emerged was a client of the Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca.  Mr Cameron committed to "looking properly" at the arguments around trusts and related private legal arrangements, such as inheritance planning.  But he warned the focus must be on lifting the veil of secrecy around shell companies and supporting a single global standard for exchanging tax information - aims championed by Mr Cameron during the UK's presidency of the G8 in 2013.  He wrote: "As we clamp down on the misuse of companies, we must take care not to displace illicit activity elsewhere".  Trust fund: A trust fund is a fund comprised of cash, stocks, bonds, property or other financial products. They are usually meant to provide benefits to an individual, often a child or grandchild, or organisation such as a charity. The fund recipient usually must wait until a certain age or until a certain event takes place in order to get an annual income from the fund. A trustee, or trustees, manage the funds, and are unable to benefit from the trust themselves.  Shell company: A shell company is a non-trading company without any significant assets or active operations. It may have had operations in the past that have become dormant or been wound down. It may be kept dormant for future use in some other capacity. Such companies are legal, but become criminal when they are used for criminal purposes such as tax evasion or money laundering.  Trust management and private wealth banking is a major source of income for Britain's financial services industry.  Responding to reports of the PM's letter to the EU, Labour Treasury spokesman Richard Burgon said the Conservatives should take tax avoidance more seriously.  He added: "And one way they can do that is to stop trying to block or undermine measures which would help to tackle it."  At the time of the PM's letter to Mr Van Rompuy, fears were being raised that the EU's proposals - aimed at money-laundering - would create extra cost and bureaucracy for families' financial planning.  The government said it had been concerned that "including trusts would distract from action against those areas of most concern, such as shell companies, and, in practice, these further changes weren't achievable".  "In the subsequent negotiations, we were able to secure a sensible way forward which ensures that trusts which generate tax consequences have to report their ownership to HMRC," a spokesman said.  Asked whether a loophole remained Dutch MEP Judith Sargentini, who led the European Parliament's work on the draft law, told the BBC: "Oh most definitely. Not only in Britain but elsewhere in Europe where they use trusts."  The British government was, she said, at the "forefront" of the lobbying.  German Green MEP Sven Giegold said the British government had been vital in securing the EU-wide beneficial ownership register for companies.  But he said the exemption for trusts meant "wealthy corporations are able to use this loophole so that poor people have to make up for the missing tax payments".  Speaking to students at Exeter University, Mr Cameron said when he chaired the G8 group of countries he had made tax and transparency "the number one issue" saying Britain was "an absolute leader" on the subject.  "Since then, Britain is going to be the first country in the world to have a totally open public register of beneficial ownership, so you can see who owns what company, and we've got other countries to sign up to that process," he added.	politics

NHS England national incident director Dr Anne Rainsberry said there would probably be greater impact on Thursday.  Junior doctors in England are taking part in a fourth strike in a long-running dispute over a new contract.  Dr Rainsberry said: "Patients are at the heart of the NHS and we can only apologise to the thousands of people facing disruption and uncertainty as a result of this ongoing action.  "We've already seen the pressure a 48-hour stoppage places on the NHS.  "The impact of the action so far is broadly in line with what we were expecting but tomorrow (Thursday) is likely to more difficult and we have made sure we have planned for this.  "Patient safety is always our absolute priority and staff across the country will be doing their utmost to make sure patients can continue to access urgent and emergency services."  NHS England said 46% of junior doctors turned up to work on Wednesday.  This included those who never intended to strike such as those providing emergency care cover.  The latest action means the total number of treatments that have been delayed has now hit 24,500 during the dispute.  The Patients Association has come out in support of junior doctors despite the disruption, saying the government should not be imposing the contract.  But despite pleas from them and other organisations for both sides to get back round the negotiating table, the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) have remained adamant they will not budge from their positions.  Sources indicated there was now little dialogue between ministers and the union with the first ever walkouts of emergency care in the history of the NHS planned for the end of April.  The all-out stoppages will take place from 08:00 to 17:00 BST on both 26 and 27 April and will see junior doctors refuse to staff A&E departments as well as emergency surgery and intensive care.  The BMA said it had been left with "no choice" in its fight against the government's plan to impose a new contract in which, it said, the profession had "no confidence".  Ministers have said the changes, which will see doctors paid less for working weekends while basic pay is increased, are needed to improve care at weekends. This is disputed by the BMA.  Over the past few weeks a host of organisations, including patient group National Voices and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, have come forward to call on the government to drop the imposition and the BMA to stop the strikes and reopen talks.  BMA junior doctors' leader Johann Malawana said: "By pursuing its current course, the government risks alienating a generation of doctors.  "If it continues to ignore junior doctors' concerns, at a time when their morale is already at rock bottom, doctors may vote with their feet which will clearly affect the long-term future of the NHS and the care it provides.  "Responsibility for industrial action now lies entirely with the government. They must start listening and resume negotiations on a properly funded junior doctors' contract to protect the future of patient care and the NHS."  Bur a Department of Health spokeswoman said: "This strike is irresponsible and disproportionate, and with almost 25,000 operations cancelled so far, it is patients who are suffering.  "If the BMA had agreed to negotiate on Saturday pay, as they promised to do through Acas in November, we'd have a negotiated agreement by now."	health

No 10 said there were "no offshore trusts or funds" that the prime minister or his immediate family would benefit from "in future".  Labour say questions still remain and want him to publish his tax returns.  It comes after a row over an investment fund set up by Mr Cameron's late father Ian.  Leaked documents revealed Ian Cameron was a client of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca and used one of the most secretive - albeit lawful - tools of the offshore trade after he helped set up a fund for investors.  But after a day of questions from the media about whether his family retains an interest in the fund, Downing Street took the unusual step of issuing a statement saying Mr Cameron, his wife and his children "do not benefit from any offshore trusts".  And Mr Cameron himself said he had no shares or income from offshore trusts.  It followed a call from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for an independent inquiry into Britons linked to tax haven allegations - including Mr Cameron's family.  But there was criticism that Mr Cameron had not said whether he had already benefitted, or would gain in the future, from offshore funds.  In its latest statement, issued on Wednesday, Downing Street told the BBC: "There are no offshore trusts or funds from which the prime minister, Mrs Cameron or their children will benefit in future."  The statement did not address the issue of whether Mr Cameron had previously gained from his late father's investment fund - which Labour's Wes Streeting said needed clarifying.  "I think there are still questions about whether or not he benefited in the past," the MP, who sits on the Commons Treasury Select Committee, told BBC Radio 4 Today.  Labour MP Jess Phillips attacked David Cameron's late father for not "paying his fair share" of tax - saying it was "utterly disgusting," in a blog for the Huffington Post.  She said Mr Cameron "doesn't need our praise for paying his tax", adding: "He's not a very clever boy, he's a very average boy who used privilege rather than brains to get where he got."  Number Ten are clearly desperate to close down the ongoing story about the prime minister's tax affairs.  Hence, four statements in 24 hours.  But every time they close down one line of questioning - it simply opens up another one. Number Ten cling to the hope that the storm will blow over. But are they whistling in the wind?  Well, perhaps not.  Journalists may keep asking ever more intricate and detailed questions but will people still be interested?  Secondly, tax havens, offshore funds, bearer shares... it's all very complicated and perhaps a bit of a turn-off.  And finally it's a bit of a "Bullingdon" row.  Everyone knows Mr Cameron comes from a wealthy and privileged background.  Those that think this disqualifies him from being prime minister will probably continue to do so. Those that think it doesn't matter, will also probably continue to do so.  But London Mayor Boris Johnson, whose relationship with Mr Cameron has been strained by the EU referendum, defended the prime minister, dismissing the allegations about his financial affairs as "absolute tripe".  "The prime minister has made a very clear statement that he does not have a trust or any income from trusts and all the rest of it," he told LBC Radio.  Mr Corbyn said he would publish his tax returns and called on the prime minister to do the same.  Chancellor George Osborne said the government had done more than any previous government to tackle tax evasion and avoidance and to "make sure people pay the taxes that are owed".  Asked whether he himself had benefitted from an offshore fund, Mr Osborne said: "All of our interests as ministers and MPs are declared in the register of members' interests. We've made our position very clear."  A source close to the chancellor later said Mr Osborne "has no offshore interests, in shares or anything else" and had "made clear" his interests were "properly declared" in the register.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid, who is in India for talks with Tata Steel, was asked about his own financial affairs, and told the BBC: "I don't have any overseas trusts or overseas funds."  The prime minister is hosting an international anti-corruption summit in London in May as part of the government's transparency agenda.  Mr Cameron has said the government has reclaimed billions of pounds and led the world in having an open register of beneficial owners of companies, which is due to come into force in June.  He is facing calls to increase the pressure on tax haven UK overseas territories to fully open up their business registers to UK law enforcement agencies to improve transparency.  Labour has also called on the prime minister to consider taking "direct rule" of UK overseas dependencies and territories that do not comply with UK tax laws.	politics

One of the women gave birth to twins after the treatment.  But her partner, who was the biological mother, had to go to court to be declared a legal parent - because the wrong forms were filled in at the clinic.  The case is among 15 similar ones brought to the High Court.  The president of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, said the clinic's lawyers had been "grossly insensitive" in their handling of the case.  He granted the woman - identified only as X - a declaration that she was a legal parent of the twins in February.  Giving his reasons for Wednesday's judgement, he said the women had been left "shocked and angry" when the clinic's error came to light.  Sir James said the women had paid more than £15,000 for their treatment with IVF Hammersmith Limited.  He described how the clinic's solicitors sent a "crass and insensitive" letter to the women, offering them £1,000 in compensation.  Sir James said in his ruling: "The offer of money, whatever the amount, was merely adding insult to injury.  "If an offer of financial compensation was appropriate at all, the idea that £1,000 began to approach a realistic figure was so wide of the mark as to be not merely insulting but almost offensively so.  "If ever there was a situation calling for empathy, understanding, humanity, compassion and, dare one say it, common decency, never mind sincere and unqualified apology, it is surely this."  The clinic's director had expressed regret in a witness statement and said there were now procedures to try and avoid any repeat of the situation.  Sir James described this as a "mealy-mouthed observation".  This case is among eight, involving a number of clinics, which have been resolved at the High Court, after the UK's fertility regulator identified the form-filling errors.  A further seven cases are still awaiting a final court hearing. It is thought as many as 85 couples could be affected in total.  A spokeswoman for IVF Hammersmith said: "We understand the stress the process and hearing has caused and we are sorry for this.  "We would like to reiterate that we have learned from this case.  "To safeguard all other patients receiving donor sperm, since 2013 we have introduced witnessing to the process, run dedicated staff training and operated continuous audits."	health

George Eustice, who is backing the Vote Leave campaign, said some farmers would welcome the end of subsidies and prefer different kinds of help.  It follows a National Farmers Union report that warned exit could push up food prices and hit farm incomes.  Farming is set to be a key battleground in the run-up to 23 June's referendum.  Much will depend on what the government would do about subsidies currently paid through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is worth about £2.4bn a year to British farmers.  Supporters of the UK leaving the EU, such as Mr Eustice, argue that the British government would continue to provide direct support for its farmers.  The NFU report sets out three scenarios for what could happen to British farms if it left the EU - in two of them food prices increase, boosting farming incomes but reducing consumption of products as they become more expensive.  In the third, farm gate prices fall, benefiting consumers through lower prices but hitting farmers' incomes in many sectors.  The first two scenarios are based on the UK striking a trade agreement with the EU or through the World Trade organisation.  The third, based on a more liberalised trade policy, has significant negative impacts on farm-gate prices, particularly meat and some dairy, according to the report by Dutch university Wageningen said.  NFU director general Martin Haworth said: "Some of the scenarios appear to suggest that there could be serious risks to farm income from leaving the EU, while the results of others suggest there could be a more favourable outcome.  "It comes down to a matter of judgment as to which of the scenarios appears the most likely. This in turn will depend on the policy position adopted by the UK government."  Former NFU president Sir Peter Kendall warned the report highlighted the most likely outcome for British agriculture, which he said made for "depressing reading, with many farms facing a severe loss of income".  Labour's shadow farming minister Nick Smith said: "Our farmers deserve every opportunity to thrive and I believe they have the strongest and safest chance to do so by staying in."  But Mr Eustice, a former strawberry farmer who stood for UKIP before joining the Conservatives, said British farms would would still be supported "to the same level, possibly even more than now" if Britain left the EU.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be possible to "get rid of the very complex bureaucratic system of cross compliance regulations that we have now, lots of pointless administration would go, we would reduce the regulatory burdens on farmers".  On subsidies, he added: "We would still support farming to the same level, possibly even more than now, some of those countries that are outside the EU support their farmers to a greater extent financially, but we might support farming differently."  Mr Eustice argued farmers he had met did not like just being given a subsidy every year, adding if support could be given to help them earn their profit from the market "they would be happier with that".  He added that food prices were governed by changes in energy prices, by weather, global changes in supply and demand, plus exchange rates. These were global phenomena, he said, adding "they won't be affected by whether or not we are in or out of the EU".	politics

A Commission spokesman told the BBC it was still waiting for information from the British government.  It cannot begin its assessment as it has yet to receive a final estimate of the flood damage.  The news means any EU payout to help repair damage is likely to be many months away.  Labour said the situation was a "total shambles" and money could already have been made available if the government had acted more quickly.  Britain had provided only a provisional estimate, putting the total cost at £1.7bn.  Ministers confirmed they were to make an application to the EU Solidarity Fund in February.  Once the Commission has received the information it has six weeks to make a decision, but the European Parliament and the European Council both have to give their approval.  A government spokesman said it had already paid out £250m of support to flood victims and the application to the EU fund would take time.  Sixteen thousand homes were flooded in December and January, with Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria in England and central and north-east Scotland among the worst affected.  A European Commission spokeswoman said: "The UK government presented the case as a regional disaster with total direct damage provisionally estimated at £1.7bn.  "It should be noted that the UK considers their damage estimates as provisional and announced that updated data will be provided as soon as possible.  "The assessment of the application by the Commission can only be completed once the updated damage figures have been provided."  The Commission stressed the EU solidarity fund was not designed to provide a rapid response but was there for long term restoration.  A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "As set out in Parliament nearly six weeks ago we made clear we were applying and are now in the process of collating and submitting the detailed information the Commission requires alongside our application.  "This will take time as communities continue to make claims under our recovery schemes and the damage to infrastructure continues to be assessed - councils, departments and devolved administrations will need to supply their final costs as they become available."  Any EU payment would be made to the British government which would then decide how to spend the money.  In 2008 the UK received around £120m from the EU to help repair damage caused by heavy floods.  The shadow floods minister Alex Cunningham said: "This is a total shambles. David Cameron urgently needs to get a grip and finalise the UK's application for funding to help communities devastated by the floods.  "Up to £23m could already have been made available to help British homes and businesses through the EU Solidarity Fund with the potential for millions more in further payouts."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35959554	Deadly diabetes in 'unrelenting march'	The world is facing an "unrelenting march" of diabetes which now affects nearly one in 11 adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.  In a major report it warned cases had nearly quadrupled to 422 million in 2014 from 108 million in 1980.  High blood sugar levels are a major killer - linked to 3.7 million deaths around the world each year, it says.  And officials said the numbers would continue to increase unless "drastic action" was taken.  The report lumps both type 1 and type 2 diabetes together, but the surge in cases is predominantly down to type 2 - the form closely linked to poor lifestyle.  As the world's waistlines have ballooned - with one-in-three people now overweight, so too has the number of diabetes cases.  Dr Etienne Krug, the WHO official in charge of leading efforts against diabetes, told the BBC: "Diabetes is a silent disease, but it is on an unrelenting march that we need to stop.  "We can stop it, we know what needs to be done, but we cannot let it evolve like it does because it has a huge impact on people's health, on families and on society."  Failing to control levels of sugar in the blood has devastating health consequences.  It triples the risk of a heart attack and leaves people 20 times more likely to have a leg amputated, as well as increasing the risk of stroke, kidney failure, blindness and complications in pregnancy.  Diabetes itself is the eighth biggest killer in the world, accounting for 1.5 million deaths each year.  But a further 2.2 million deaths are linked to high blood sugar levels. And 43% of the deaths were before the age of 70.  In the 1980s the highest rates were found in affluent countries.  But, in a remarkable transformation, it is now low and middle income countries bearing the largest burden.  Dr Krug told the BBC News website: "That's where we see the steepest increase. Knowing that's where most of the population lives in the world, it does show numbers will continue to increase unless drastic action is taken."  The Middle East has seen the prevalence of diabetes soar from 5.9% of adults in 1980 to 13.7% in 2014.  Dr Slim Slama, a WHO specialist in region, told the BBC News website: "We are the region that has experienced the greatest rise in diabetes, moving from 6 million to 43 million - it is a huge, huge increase.  "In Qatar or Kuwait we have more than 20% of the population with diabetes and when you look at subgroups - people beyond 45 or 60 years old - it's 30-40% and things are even more worrying."  He said growing and ageing populations were behind part of the rise, but diet and inactivity were a major problem.  More than three quarters of teenagers in the region are doing less than the recommended level of exercise, he said.  The WHO report said the solution required the whole of society to act.  "The 'easy' solution is for all of us to exercise, eat healthily and not gain excess weight - of course it's not so easy," said Dr Krug.  He called for governments to regulate the fat and sugar content of foods to ensure there were healthy options available to people.  Better urban planning that encouraged people to cycle and walk was also essential, he added.  And he also called on the food industry to act responsibly to ensure it reduced the fat and sugar content of foods, and to cease marketing unhealthy foods to young people.  It is only by keeping blood sugar levels in check that the deadly complications of the disease can be contained.  But the report showed that two thirds of low income countries were not able to provide blood sugar monitors or drugs such as insulin or metformin for most people.  Dr Krug concluded: "Two things really worry me when I read this report.  "One is that one-in-11 people today have diabetes. And the other is the lack of fairness. Today in most low income countries, people who have diabetes and need access to medicine and technology to manage it don't have access to it."  Do you have diabetes?

Dr Jason Seebaluk, 27, works in Euston, London. He is moving to Australia permanently in August because of the government's proposed amendments to junior doctors' contracts, which will see a change in pay and working hours.  The government believes the changes are needed to enable them to rota more doctors on at weekends and that the new contract is a good deal for junior doctors.  The General Medical Council says so far this year, it has issued more than 2,200 Certificates of Current Professional Status which doctors need in order to work abroad, although not all who request them actually leave.  The Department of Health have said the figures do not reflect the actual number of doctors planning to leaving the UK. They added: "Our latest data shows only 90 fewer training places have been filled this year compared to last and we still have two more recruitment rounds to go."  Today's strike is the fourth junior doctors' protest to date, with further strikes in emergency care scheduled at the end of April.  BBC News has been speaking to Dr Seebaluk and other junior doctors who are considering their future:  "I am finishing my foundation year two and in August, I will be moving to Australia permanently," says Dr Seebaluk.  "I have always wanted to gain some experience working overseas but because of the proposed changes to junior doctor contracts I am quite certain my fiancee and I will now settle in Australia for good.  "I am passionate about medicine and I realise this is the country where I was raised, but currently the rotas we are on just do not allow for any kind of work-life balance.  "The NHS is a great example of how medicine should be practised around the world but it is in a bit of a mess at the moment.  "I do feel a sense of guilt leaving but I have to think about my future."The junior doctors planning to move abroad  Dr Dagan Lonsdale works at St George's Hospital in south London. He believes thousands of doctors have a similar story and will move overseas to places like Australia or the Middle East if new contracts come into force in England.  Dr Lonsdale, 32, an intensive care registrar in clinical pharmacology, believes the lure of working abroad could lead to a brain drain of NHS junior doctors.  "My wife and I are both doctors.  "We moved to Australia in 2011 and returned in 2012 because we wanted to work in the NHS.  "We believe in its core values, but we think trying to stretch five days staffing over seven will inevitably lead to doctors working excessive hours, and the reduction in safeguards to prevent this puts our ability to deliver safe care at risk.  "We are now considering our options, one of which may be to leave to work overseas again.  "I know there is an attempt to lure British medics overseas. I receive regular emails from recruitment agencies. Until recently, I used to ignore them.  "I have an 18-month-old son and it's not an unreasonable expectation to want to spend time with him and my family. Doctors are people too.  "I always work weekends and have worked seven Christmases since qualifying.  "I expect to work antisocial hours, but I believe increasing the amount of these hours will stop me being able to provide a family life for my son.  "The appeal of working overseas is understandable. In Australia, a 36-hour week is common, as employers know junior doctors who are tired make mistakes.  "In addition, doctors are expected to report any breaches of working hours. The health and safety of doctors and patients is inbuilt in the Australian system.  "I believe a junior doctor brain drain is inevitable if this contract is imposed, and that will lead to a crisis in the NHS of epic proportions."  In 2015, more than 8,000 CCPS requests were granted to UK doctors.  The General Medical Council says: "Applications spiked in September last year because of a social media campaign when doctors began to protest against the proposed change to employment contracts.  "We were unable to distinguish between doctors making a protest application and those actually considering working abroad.  "The number of doctors registered in the UK has also risen year on year. This has been followed by a rise in CCPS requests."  Dr Thea Bishop moved to Australia two years ago. She had intended to return but has decided to stay on partly because of the new contracts.  "I left my job as a junior doctor in the NHS in August 2014. I decided to go to Australia for a year to gain some experience and complete my emergency medical training.  "But over a year on and I have no desire to return and these new contracts play a big factor in that decision.  "Working in Australia, I feel valued, I am rested in between my shifts. I can choose when to take leave. I still work incredibly hard as it is a very demanding job but I come into work every day enthusiastic, and that is something I didn't feel working in the NHS.  "Working here allows me to care for my patients safely, and sensitively. I don't want to have a rushed consultation, especially if I'm breaking bad news.  "Many of my colleagues back in the UK are leaving the profession altogether.  "I know that where I work we receive lots of inquiries from doctors in the UK looking for jobs in Australia."  "It's not an easy decision to continue living here. My family lives in the UK, as does my husband's, and it can be tough being so far from home.  "I never intended to stay here and neither did the other 15 junior doctors in our group who moved to Australia 18 months ago.  "Out of just our group, only three have returned and of those three, only one is going back to the NHS.  "I do feel sad about 'jumping ship' but we have to protect our physical, and emotional wellbeing."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34775980	Junior doctors' row: The dispute explained	Ministers and junior doctors are locked in an increasingly fraught dispute in England. But what exactly is the row about?  Junior doctors' leaders are objecting to the prospect of a new contract in England.  The government has described the current arrangements as "outdated" and "unfair", pointing out they were introduced in the 1990s.  Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012, but talks broke down in 2014.  They restarted at the end of last year at the conciliation service Acas but a deal could not be reached and so ministers announced in February they would be imposing the contract from this summer.  There are two legal challenges to that imposition which are now being planned, one by the British Medical Association and another by campaign group Just Health.  Will the dispute have a toxic legacy?  Was a deal ever possible?  No. The term junior doctor is a little misleading. It covers medics who have just graduated from medical school through to those who have more than a decade of experience on the front line.  The starting salary for a junior doctor is currently just under £23,000 a year, but with extra payments for things such as unsociable hours, this can quite easily top £30,000.  Junior doctors at the top end of the scale can earn in excess of £70,000. But it's important to remember these doctors can be in charge of teams, making life-and-death decisions and carrying out surgery. They are really only behind consultants in seniority.  In total, there are 55,000 junior doctors in England - representing a third of the medical workforce. The BMA has just over 37,700 members.  How does your pay compare to a junior doctor?  What exactly do junior doctors do?  Basic pay is to be increased by 13.5% on average.  But that comes at a price: other elements of the pay package are to be curbed, including what constitutes unsociable hours.  Day hours on a Saturday will be paid at a normal rate, while extra premiums that are being offered for night and the rest of the weekend are lower than what is currently paid.  Guaranteed pay increases linked to time in the job are also to be scrapped and replaced with a system linked to progression through set training stages.  Special report: Read more on the dispute  To start with, no. Ministers have promised to protect the pay of existing doctors for the first three years.  A small number - about 1% - who do lots of extra hours and qualify for premium payments that are being scrapped could lose out however.  But these changes are not just about winners and losers on day one. They have partly been designed to make it cheaper to roster extra doctors on at weekends.  Therefore, medics are likely to find they are working more weekends, which, under the existing contract, would have led to extra pay.  What is more, some of the changes will take time to have an effect. For example, the ending of guaranteed pay rises linked to time-in-the-job will mean some doctors find their pay will go up more slowly during their time as a junior medic.  And, of course, new doctors starting their career in the NHS under this contract may be worse off than they would have been if they started under the current deal.  Yes. You may have noticed the government in England is intent on improving the range of services that are available seven days a week.  It has also found itself at loggerheads with the BMA over plans to change the consultants' contract - talks are under way on that.  Junior doctors already work weekends - in fact, they provide the bulk of the medical staffing on Saturdays and Sundays.  But the financial benefit of extending what constitutes "normal hours" to a Saturday is obvious.  This has been one of the most contentious areas of the dispute.  The health secretary has argued that he wants to improve care on Saturdays and Sundays because research shows patients are more likely to die if they are admitted on a weekend.  A study published by the British Medical Journal in September found those admitted on Saturdays had a 10% higher risk of death and on Sundays 15% higher compared with Wednesdays.  But doctors have objected to suggestions that all those deaths are avoidable and could be prevented through increased staffing.  Patients admitted at weekends tend to be sicker and while researchers tried to take this into account they could not say whether they had accounted for it totally.  However, the paper did say the findings raised "challenging questions" about the way services were organised at weekends.  The dispute over the contract is an England-only issue.  Scotland and Wales have both said they will be sticking to their existing contracts, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.  This is largely because they do not have the pressures on costs in terms of seven-day services.  While there are moves to improve access to care at weekends elsewhere in the UK, the plans are not on the scale of what the government in England is trying to achieve.  For example, in Wales the focus has been on more weekend access to diagnostic tests, pharmacies and therapies rather than creating more seven-day working across the whole system.

Prof Andrew Bush and Dr Louise Fleming warn that although steroid inhalers are life-saving when used properly, their side-effects should not be ignored.  And they call for more objective, careful diagnoses.  Meanwhile charity Asthma UK says better tests are urgently needed.  In the UK, about 5.4 million people currently receive treatment for asthma - 1.1 million of whom are children.  Writing in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, the two respiratory doctors from Imperial College and the Royal Brompton Hospital in London acknowledge that asthma can be a fatal condition that was once not being diagnosed enough.  They argue the pendulum has now swung too far the other way - with over-diagnosis resulting in some people seeing asthma as a trivial matter and overlooking the potential it has to kill.  Doctors currently use guidelines to help work out if someone has the condition but making a diagnosis can be difficult as there is no definitive test.  The article says doctors should think very carefully about each diagnosis they make and consider the use of more objective and sometimes more invasive checks - such as testing nitrogen oxide levels and blood tests - if they are unsure.  And if a child is not getting better despite asthma medication then, instead of increasing doses automatically, they add that the possibility that the diagnosis might not be correct should be considered.  The paper also urges medics to remember that many children outgrow their symptoms and says they should check diagnoses over time to ensure they are still relevant.  New National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for England, which are now out for consultation before final approval, say doctors should use more clinical tests to back up their judgement and avoid the danger of wrongly labelling someone as having asthma.  Prof Mark Baker of NICE said: "Accurate diagnosis of asthma has been a significant problem which means that people may be wrongly diagnosed or cases might be missed in others."  Meanwhile the charity Asthma UK said more funds need to be put towards the research and development of a definitive test for the condition.  The charity's Dr Samantha Walker added: "It is astonishing in the 21st century that there isn't a test your child can take to tell if they definitely have asthma.  "Asthma isn't one condition but many, with different causes and triggered by different things at different ages. Asthma symptoms also change throughout someone's life or even week-by-week and day-by-day.  "This complexity means that it is both over and under-diagnosed, in children and in adults, so people don't get the care they need to manage their asthma effectively.  "As a result, a child is admitted to hospital every 20 minutes because of an asthma attack and asthma attacks still kill the equivalent of a classroom of children every year in the UK."  Dr Martin Allen, a lung specialist and member of the British Thoracic Society, said: "The key message for patients is that they should carry on taking their medication as prescribed.  "If patients have any concerns or want further advice on their care and treatment, they should always consult their health professional.'	health

"Europe. And Corbyn."  The former because it might motivate otherwise disillusioned or dormant UKIP supporters to go the polls rather than just wait for the EU referendum in June.  And the latter because the settled view of some in the Parliamentary Labour Party is that Jeremy Corbyn's popularity among Labour's membership is not shared by the party's traditional voters.  So while local candidates will feature prominently on Labour's election literature, in some areas the national leader will not.  Indeed the fear amongst some of Mr Corbyn's own MPs is that he would repel rather than attract support.  So those of Corbyn critics who don't want to utter his name are motivated by the desire for Labour to do well in this set of elections.  But privately some in Labour's ranks have been wondering whether to "take the foot off the gas" when it comes to campaigning because a poorer result could convince some of the newer members of the party that Jeremy Corbyn is indeed unelectable in large parts of England, outside London.  This is the school of thought that believes if things are really going to get better for Labour - under a different leader - then first they have to get worse.  Here the battle of pre and post-election spin won't simply be fought between the parties, but within the Labour Party.  The widespread assumption is that Sadiq Khan will see off Zac Goldsmith in the contest for London Mayor.  He has kept his distance from Jeremy Corbyn - and some of his key backroom staff are exiles from Labour head office who found the new regime un-convivial.  But Mr Khan's victory, if it happens, will be hailed by Mr Corbyn's supporters as an important gain from the Conservatives.  Better still, they will embrace the Conservative attack that Sadiq Khan will be "Corbyn's man in City Hall".  Proof then, they will say, that even an unwelcome association with the Labour leader can help deliver votes, not drive them away.  Corbyn's critics are likely to point out that any win in London should be expected - the party gained seven points in London between the 2010 and 2015 general elections.  And even at the last mayoral election in 2012, Labour gained more votes than any other party in the simultaneous London assembly elections, with 42% of the vote to the Conservatives' 32%.  So the argument goes, Boris Johnson won the mayoralty partly because he is Boris Johnson - but partly because he was up against Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing fellow traveller Ken Livingstone.  At the other end of the UK, the spin will focus on a certain Labour defeat rather than an expected victory.  Polls suggest the SNP will gain another overall majority in the Scottish Parliament.  If Labour finish a poor second under the pro-Trident Kezia Dugdale, Jeremy Corbyn will pretty much escape any personal blame.  Just about everyone across Labour's political spectrum from pale pink to deepest red acknowledges that turning round the party's fortunes in Scotland will take time.  However, in the unlikely but not impossible event that Labour slips to third place in the Holyrood Parliament behind a confident Conservative contingent, the argument will be rather different.  Jeremy Corbyn's internal opponents will bring out the political skean dhus (see above). They will point out that his anti-austerity stance was supposed to win back recent defectors to the SNP.  They will say that while Kezia Dugdale is no Corbynista, she fought a campaign based on tax rises and opposition to public service cuts.  If that stance can't improve the party's standing in social democratically-inclined Scotland, what chance does it have south of the border?  And similarly anti-Corbyn voices will be raised if Labour loses its majority on the Welsh Assembly.  But the main battleground will be the English local elections - and the attempt to construct a prism through which the results here are viewed has already begun.  Those close to Jeremy Corbyn are already saying that judging their performance against the 2012 results, when most of these seats were last fought, is unfair - as it was a particularly good year for Ed Miliband, who had had 18 months as Labour leader by then.  Voters had gone to the polls with George Osborne's "omnishambles" Budget - with its pasty tax, its charity tax and the subsequent U-turns on both - fresh in their minds. Labour gained 500 seats in England then.  And the out-and-out opponents of Jeremy Corbyn are already setting this year's bar high - suggesting that at this stage in the electoral cycle Labour should be making more than 400 gains.  Meanwhile, a new analysis by the two leading academics - Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher - who study council by-election results suggests that, based on Labour's recent performance, the party could be on course to lose 150 seats.  But circulating among some in the Labour leader's shadow ministerial team is an analysis by YouGov's Marcus Roberts - formerly of Labour think tank the Fabian Society.  He has pointed out that - apart from general election years - Labour has only come behind the Conservatives twice in council elections when in opposition in the past four decades.  That was in 1982 - under the shadow of the Falklands conflict and the SDP split - and in 1985, amid the miners' strike and very public battles with the ultra-left Militant Tendency.  Even in Michael Foot's first year as leader the party gained 98 seats.  Mr Roberts says Labour should - by historical standards - be looking to pick up about 300 seats.  The party should be seeking to control councils such as Plymouth, where Labour lost parliamentary seats last year, and Pendle - which Ed Miliband visited on the eve of poll in the general election, but failed to win the next day.  Should Labour fall short of this benchmark, it's perfectly possible that some of Mr Corbyn's own shadow ministers could take to the airwaves and declare that it has - in that classic election programme phrase - been a "bad night for Labour".  Already some MPs who were close to either Gordon Brown or Tony Blair - or both - are weighing up a leadership challenge.  This wouldn't happen until after the June EU referendum, but poor results in the local elections would give them the ammunition.  Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are well aware of the manoeuvrings so apart from being prepared to "spin" bad results, they are organising to achieve rather better ones.  They won't talk openly of target councils but the website of Momentum - the self-declared "successor to the campaign to elect Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party" - says it is "organising to support Labour candidates in the various May elections".  Now at one level, it would be odd if they weren't.  But their critics say they are not nearly as committed to campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU.  Some of Momentum's insiders say they will happily focus on that referendum, but only once the local elections are out of the way.  That's because they know good results in May could spike the guns of those who want to challenge Mr Corbyn and make a leadership contest appear bizarre.  And while many on the party's left may feel more motivated when campaigning for Labour candidates who are Momentum supporters, they won't be looking for ideological purity.  The winner of last year's Oldham West and Royton parliamentary by-election, Jim McMahon, is not regarded as particularly left wing but Momentum packed five buses full of supporters from five different cities - about 150 people - to campaign for him, and Labour's share of the vote went up on a turnout of 39%.  Similar targeting of effort in council elections - which also tend to have low turnouts, often in the low 30s - might help make crucial gains or stave off potential losses.  The Labour slogan for the campaign is "standing up, not standing by".  It seems some of the party's MPs will be standing up to - and not standing by - their leader if he and his supporters fail to deliver reasonable results.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35965499	Corbyn: Council polls can be 'turning point' for Labour	Jeremy Corbyn has said he wants May's English council elections to mark a "turning point" in Labour's fortunes.  Launching its campaign, he said Labour must stand up against cuts to services and show a different way of running the country "for the good of all".  He criticised the government's record on housing, benefit cuts and low pay and plans for more academy schools.  The 5 May elections are the first UK-wide ballot box test for Mr Corbyn since his election last September.  As well as the local authority elections in England, polls are also being held for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations as well as to elect a London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.  Labour made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems the last time these seats on 124 councils in England were contested in 2012.  Mr Corbyn will be hoping to hang on to those gains and make progress in the south of England and the Midlands - areas where Labour did poorly in last year's general election - to silence internal criticism of the party's electability under his leadership.  In a speech in Labour-controlled Harlow, Mr Corbyn said he was the first Labour leader for 80 years who had served as a councillor and had personal experience of the role they played.  Accusing Conservative town halls of stripping out services and turning many areas into "cultural deserts", he said a Labour council was "the best protection" against an "onslaught" of cuts.  A visit to Bristol had shown him people being "socially cleansed out of a community they have lived in for many, many years" due to rising rents, with the same happening in cities across the country, he said.  Labour councils, Mr Corbyn said, were "standing up" for residents by introducing a "genuine living wage" for town hall staff and insisting it is matched by council contractors.  "Even in the toughest of times it is Labour councils that are making better choices."  He praised Labour town halls' record on building council housing but argued more needs to be done across the country to increase the supply of affordable homes.  He urged activists to take Labour's message to "every doorstep" in the country.  "Let May 5 be the turning point when Labour grew, Labour got support and Labour showed there is a different, much better way of running this country for the good of all not just for the benefit of the very few wealthy people who have had it easy for too long."  In the speech, he also urged the government to "act now to save the steel industry" by bringing forward £35bn of infrastructure projects using British steel.  "This industry is too important to our manufacturing economy and our security to fail," he said.  "This government's ideological allergy to public ownership is stopping it taking the steps needed to save steel."  The Conservatives hit back at Mr Corbyn's attack on their housing policies, saying the government had doubled the housing budget with the number of new homes up by 25% in the past year.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'The Labour Party left the lowest level of housebuilding since the 1920s and has opposed every measure this government has taken to boost ownership and supply."	politics

NHS staff campaign group Just Health started proceedings after raising £100,000 in four days online.  The move follows separate legal action made by the British Medical Association last week seeking a judicial review.  A Department of Health spokesman said legal action was "expensive" for all parties and "totally unwarranted".  The news comes before Wednesday's planned 48-hour strike affecting routine and non-urgent care is due to start.  The strike will be the fourth time doctors have taken industrial action in the long-running dispute.  Just Health alleges government's decision to impose the contract, affecting about 45,000 medics, did not allow for adequate consultation.  The group raised the £100,000 through a crowdfunding website which remains open to donations.  Dr Marie-Estella McVeigh, from Just Health, said: "We feel this contract imposition has been rushed through without appropriate consideration and due process.  "There is no evidence that it will deliver a safer system or better quality care for our patients; it will instead exacerbate the staffing crisis we are already struggling with across the NHS."  The BMA, in its legal claim, alleges that the government failed to "pay due regard" to the equalities impact of the new contracts and is calling for a judicial review.  Talks between the government and BMA broke down in January, prompting the government to announce the following month that it would be imposing the contract in the summer.  Ministers have said the changes, which will see doctors paid less for working weekends, are needed to improve care at weekends and create a "seven-day service". This is disputed by the BMA.  Currently, junior doctors are paid more for working unsocial hours at night or at the weekend.  But under the imposed new contracts, the Saturday day shift will be paid at a normal rate in return for a rise in basic pay.  Last month, the Department of Health described the forthcoming strike action by doctors as "desperate and irresponsible".	health

The Foreign Affairs Committee said the government gave the impression of prioritising trade and security with China, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  This was despite a doubling in funding for the Foreign Office's dedicated human rights project.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said improving human rights was a "core function of the Foreign Office".  But the committee's chairman, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, said: "The actions and words of ministers in the Foreign Office have undermined the excellent human rights work carried out by the department.  "This needs to be remedied."  Giving evidence to the committee in October, Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office's most senior civil servant, said human rights was "not one of our top priorities".  This was strongly rejected by ministers, but the committee said written evidence it received suggested there was "plainly a perception that this has occurred".  The committee welcomed the doubling of funding for the department's human rights programme, called the Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy, to £10.6m.  But it said the decision to restrict the fund to registered organisations "acts against an intelligent deployment of resources".  The MPs criticised remarks by Middle East Minister Tobias Ellwood, who told the committee he could not remember whether he had raised human rights during a visit to Egypt with a business delegation.  "We are disappointed by the parliamentary under-secretary of state's choice of language on this occasion and others, which raises questions about how energetically the government is raising human rights issues," the MPs said.  And they said the Foreign Office had failed to send an "important message" by not including Egypt and Bahrain on a list of "Human Rights Priority Countries", saying this "contributes to the perception that the [Foreign Office] has become more hesitant in promoting and defending international human rights openly and robustly, notwithstanding the importance of private diplomacy".  The department should be "more mindful of the perceptions it creates at ministerial level" in its dealings with China, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the report said, because "perceptions and symbols matter."  It also said the the department's failure to fly the rainbow flag - an international symbol of equality - for the London Pride event in 2015 "sent a message that contradicts much of the actual work and objectives" of the department.  And it suggested the Foreign Office's human rights work should be presented in a more "user-friendly fashion" so it can be evaluated more easily.  Mr Hammond said: "I do not recognise this characterisation of our human rights work."  The UK supports over 75 human rights projects in more than 40 countries, he said, adding that the doubling of funding for the projects was "a true measure of the importance we attach to this agenda".  He added: "By mainstreaming human rights within the Foreign Office, we have ensured it will always be a central part of our diplomacy, delivering tangible results."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35959556	Vitamin D 'heals damaged hearts'	Vitamin D supplements may help people with diseased hearts, a study suggests.  A trial on 163 heart failure patients found supplements of the vitamin, which is made in the skin when exposed to sunlight, improved their hearts' ability to pump blood around the body.  The Leeds Teaching Hospitals team, who presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, described the results as "stunning".  The British Heart Foundation called for longer trials to assess the pills.  Vitamin D is vital for healthy bones and teeth and may have important health benefits throughout the body but many people are deficient.  No safe way to suntan - warning  The average age of people in the study was 70 and like many people that age they had low levels of vitamin D even in summer.  "They do spend less time outside, but the skin's ability to manufacture vitamin D also gets less effective [with age] and we don't really understand why that is," said consultant cardiologist Dr Klaus Witte.  Patients were given either a 100 microgram vitamin D tablet or a sugar pill placebo each day for a year.  And researchers measured the impact on heart failure - a condition in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood properly.  The key measure was the ejection fraction, the amount of blood pumped out of the chambers of the heart with each beat.  In a healthy adult the figure is between 60% and 70%, but only a quarter of the blood in the heart was being successfully pumped out in the heart failure patients.  But in those taking the vitamin pills, the ejection fraction increased from 26% to 34%.  Dr Witte told the BBC News website: "It's quite a big deal, that's as big as you'd expect from other more expensive treatments that we use, it's a stunning effect.  "It's as cheap as chips, has no side effects and a stunning improvement on people already on optimal medical therapy, it is the first time anyone has shown something like this in the last 15 years."  The study also showed the patients hearts became smaller - a suggestion they are becoming more powerful and efficient.  In the UK, people over 65 are advised to take 10 microgram supplements of the vitamin.  However, Dr Witte does not think high-dose vitamin D should be routine prescribed just yet.  He told the BBC: "We're a little bit off that yet, not because I don't believe it, but data have shown improvements in heart function, they may show improvements in symptoms and we now need a large study."  It is also not clear exactly how vitamin D is improving heart function, but it is thought every cell in the body responds to the vitamin.  Most vitamin D comes from sunlight, although it is also found in oily fish, eggs and is added to some foods such as breakfast cereals.  Prof Peter Weissberg, from the British Heart Foundation, cautioned that the patients seemed no better at exercise.  And added: "A much bigger study over a longer period of time is now needed to determine whether these changes in cardiac function can translate into fewer symptoms and longer lives for heart failure patients."	health

The proposals were drawn up after talks with Tata Steel, which plans to sell its UK plants.  Unions called on David Cameron to intervene to prevent the closure of Tata's Port Talbot plant, accusing Business Secretary Sajid Javid of "taking his eye off the ball".  Government sources said Mr Javid was in "full control" of the situation.  The business department he leads is in "full crisis mode", they added.  On Twitter, Mr Javid said he had held a "productive" meeting with Tata executives, adding: "Progress is being made."  Tata Steel announced last week it was selling its loss-making UK businesses and would close its plant at Port Talbot unless a buyer was found.  The company directly employs 15,000 workers in the UK and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  Who might buy Tata in Port Talbot?  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  Ministers said they were optimistic that a buyer would be found for the whole business.  One potential buyer told the BBC he could take over all of the business without mass job losses.  Sanjeev Gupta, the head of the Liberty Group, said he had "very encouraging" talks with the UK government so far, but there was still a lot of work to do.  Mr Javid will travel to Mumbai on Tuesday to meet Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry for discussions about the sales process.  Beforehand he is due to meet union representatives, when he will be urged to back their plan for the future of the Tata sites.  It involves securing the customer base by guaranteeing production at Tata sites, not allowing Tata or other buyers to "cherry pick" parts of the business, and offering government support for two to three years while the industry gets "back to self-sustainability".  Speaking at the union talks in London, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey told the BBC Tata had expressed a desire to complete the sale "speedily", adding: "That's not really good enough if they want to be a responsible company."  He said Tata was "under some pressure from ourselves to do the right thing, not to just rush away in a matter of weeks" and called on the government to "put a protective arm around the industry".  BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said a pension fund covering 140,000 steel workers looked set to be "critical" to any sale.  A source involved with the Liberty House talks said the company and other potential buyers would regard taking on Tata's pension liabilities as "too big an ask".  Mr Javid, under pressure over his handling of the crisis, signalled on Sunday that ministers were working on plans to take on some of the pension liabilities and to reduce energy costs to make a purchase more attractive to investors.  But Norman Smith said there was concern that a government move to cover workers' pensions could flout EU state aid rules.  Unions say they wrote to Mr Cameron last week seeking a meeting and have not received a reply - but Downing Street said no correspondence had been received.  Roy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said: "By now, no-one underestimates the scale of the challenge we face. We have an entire industry to save and not a lot of time to save it.  "We must also ensure that we hold Tata to a commitment to be a responsible seller and honour its moral and social duties to UK steel communities."  Speaking on a visit to Tata's plant in Rotherham, Business Minister Anna Soubry said the government "will talk to anybody who has a genuine reputation and is genuinely interested" in the company's UK interests.  She said the government would do everything possible to secure the future of the industry in the UK.  Tata Steel has said there is "no fixed timeline" for the sale process but stressed that urgency is needed to avoid "a long period of uncertainty" for employees and customers.  Labour says the government should be prepared to take the Port Talbot plant - which Tata says is losing £1m a day - into public ownership to safeguard its future until a buyer can be found.  It also wants major projects involving large amounts of steel to be fast-tracked.  Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the future of British steel-making was "hanging in the balance" and accused the government of being "still missing in action".  Meanwhile Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones faced questions from assembly members over the steel crisis in a hastily reconvened meeting. He is expected to hold talks with Mr Cameron in Downing Street on Tuesday.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35955546	Steel crisis: Sanjeev Gupta in talks over Port Talbot sale	Steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta has held preliminary talks with the government over the possible purchase of Port Talbot steelworks, the BBC understands.  A source close to Mr Gupta said the discussions had not been substantive but he would seek further talks when he flies back to the UK early next week.  Government help on energy costs and plant modernisation are issues he wants to discuss, according to a source.  It comes as the government said it was ready to offer financial support to "clinch a buyer" to save the steelworks, where more than 4,000 jobs are at risk.  Tata Steel - which announced last week that it was selling its loss-making UK businesses - has said it will close the plant unless it finds a buyer.  German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp has also been touted as another potential buyer, according to reports.  Tata directly employs 15,000 workers in the UK and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  It said it was "committed to running a meaningful process to explore strategic alternatives" for its UK business.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  Mr Gupta's commodities firm Liberty House has already saved several UK steelworks.  A source close to the businessman said he was "definitely interested" in Tata's "downstream" operations and was looking at options which would keep liquid steel-making in the UK.  BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Gupta wanted to discuss possible government help to replace Port Talbot's traditional blast furnaces with modern electric arc furnaces and energy costs.  The source said it would not be an open-ended commitment, would protect most of the jobs at the site and could make it more profitable in the long term.  Extra relief from carbon tax is another important issue, according to the source.  On Sunday's Andrew Marr show, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he would rule nothing out, but he maintained the government's view that nationalisation was not the answer to the crisis.  It wants to find a commercial buyer for the Port Talbot plant, saying this will offer a "long-term, viable future".  Mr Javid signalled that ministers were working on plans to reduce energy costs and take on some of the pension liabilities to make a purchase more attractive to investors.  Tata Steel has said there is "no fixed timeline" for the sale process but stressed that urgency is needed to avoid "a long period of uncertainty" employees and customers.  It said the sale process began on 30 March and added: "Tata Steel Europe is in the process of finalising the appointment of advisers and will soon launch a process globally of seeking an investor for the UK operations."  Labour says the government should be prepared to take the Port Talbot plant - which Tata says is losing £1m a day - into public ownership to safeguard its future until a buyer can be found.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested the government could maintain a stake in the plant after a sale.  He has also urged ministers to speed up infrastructure projects, such as HS2, to support the steel industry and encourage investment.  Mr Javid - who was criticised for being in Australia during Tata's crunch meeting in Mumbai last Tuesday - admitted that Tata's announcement had caught the government by surprise  He said the government had known "a few weeks ago" that Tata was reviewing its UK operations and persuaded it not to go ahead with the immediate closure of Port Talbot - but its decision to sell off its UK assets had gone "much further than we expected".  Mr McDonnell said Mr Javid should not continue in his role as business secretary.  He told the Radio 4's World This Weekend programme someone "more dynamic" and "effective" was needed.  Ministers have faced criticism for failing to take more action to prevent the "dumping" of cheap Chinese steel - selling it cheaply at a loss - seen as one of the key reasons for the problems in the UK steel industry.  On Marr, Mr Javid said the UK had been "the leader" in pushing for action on tariffs but he said protectionism "is in no-one's interests".  Elsewhere, the government has played down the impact of new Chinese import tariffs of up to 46.3%.  David Cameron and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones will meet on Tuesday to discuss the situation.	politics

She's from Africa	Back in 2008, South African physicist Neil Turok gave a speech in which he declared his wish that the next Einstein would be from Africa.  It was a rallying call for investment in maths and physics research in Africa. The "Next Einstein" slogan became a mission for the organisation Neil Turok had founded to bring Africa into the global scientific community: the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).  That search for an African Einstein now has some results, with 15 "Next Einstein Fellows" and 54 "Next Einstein Ambassadors" announced at an event last month.  These are young African scientists, often leaders in their fields, working and studying in Africa.  "Einstein is a natural, easy role model for people to look at - not just because he was a spectacular scientist, but also he thought about the way we should care for social justice as well as science," says the 36-year-old South African cosmologist Amanda Weltman, speaking to the BBC Discovery programme.  Her work on the Chameleon field, a way to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, is seen as a continuation of Einstein's work.  "Where Einstein triggered all these completely new ideas and brought about revolution, that's what we want to do. It's not necessarily to be that person, but to be revolutionary and fearless," Dr Weltman adds.  When Neil Turok made his declaration, he wasn't thinking so much of a literal African Einstein, but of creating opportunities to nurture young scientific leaders who would challenge the stereotypes of Africa and champion its development through science.  "There is a huge youth demographic in Africa and this will get bigger; 40% of the world's youth will be African by 2050," he says.  "Many scientists around the world are more than happy to come to Africa for a few weeks a year and share their knowledge and insights with the most able young Africans."  The apparent gap between studying maths or physics and Africa's needs - in public health and disease control, for example - might seem huge. But one branch of science can inform another.  Thierry Zomahoun, the CEO of AIMS, cites the example of the west African Ebola outbreak, where local work on mathematical modelling of the virus might have slowed the spread of the disease at an earlier stage.  "It's urgent for mathematical epidemiologists to be trained on the continent, for lab technicians to be trained so that we don't have to invest billions of dollars paying expatriate technicians from France or the US to do the work that we could have done here," he said.  Mr Zomahoun is also the chair of the Next Einstein Forum - an AIMS initiative which held a gathering in March in Dakar, Senegal, both to celebrate the Next Einstein Fellows and to raise the political profile of the need for investment in scientific research in Africa.  Rwanda's President Paul Kagame was one of the speakers.  "We cannot be satisfied with just ending extreme poverty. Our aim is shared and sustainable prosperity and the key to that is science and innovation," he told the conference.  Foreign donors, especially former colonial powers, have played a big part historically in developing African education - particularly in science - but have also dictated what kind of research is done.  That model is changing, says Evelyn Gitau, adding that her Kenya-based research into cellular immunology and malaria is only possible because of large-scale funding and a hands-off approach from the UK's Wellcome Trust.  In order to own scientific progress, Dr Gitau says, African governments must get more involved.  "African governments have to change how they think. Travel grants are great, but $10 to $20,000 is not going to fund research at the cutting-edge level."  From the beginning, AIMS had a funding policy which compelled African governments to step up to the plate. Its institutes get half their funding from the governments of the countries in which they are based - South Africa, Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon - and the rest from foreign governments and private foundations.  New AIMS institutes are planned for Morocco and also Rwanda.  Rwanda styles itself as the place to do business in Africa, making it easy to set up there, especially for entrepreneurs from other African countries.  It sits, however, in a region with a history of instability and autocratic government. That doesn't sound like a place for free-thinking scientists to thrive.  This is an issue Neil Turok is only too aware of.  "This does not mean we are an instrument of the Rwandan government. AIMS is all about freedom - it's about freedom to learn, freedom to express opinions... Science is all about critical thinking. Nothing we do will compromise that," he says.  "We feel by getting involved in Rwanda now, we can be on the side of progress."  Africa might seem an unlikely destination for high-end scientific research, but this is becoming a reality and the continent has some natural scientific advantages.  Amada Weltman cites the example of the Square Kilometre Array - the world's largest radio telescope, currently under construction. This "south south" project (the second section of it is in Australia) could not have been built in more densely industrialised countries, due to the amount of radio-wave pollution in their skies.  "We didn't get that project just because of some sort of sympathy towards Africa. We consider the night sky as a resource, where Africa is perhaps more empowered than the global north, which is already overly polluted with radio waves. So this gives us a fresh angle to how we think about the universe."  There are advantages in other fields, too. For scientists using bioinformatics to explore the origins of genetic disease, Africa holds a unique place as the cradle of humanity - and therefore the repository of our oldest genetic information.  The continent's future scientific development could have a profound impact on the future of mankind.  Julian Siddle's radio documentary on the Next Einstein initiative will air on the BBC World Service at 22:30 GMT on Monday and is available to download now.	politics

Hundreds of Tata Steel workers gathered to demand answers from Mr Javid as he left a meeting at the plant.  Holding a "Save our Steel" banner, workers asked him: "So you're not going to let us go to the wall?"  He said he would be "fully involved" in talks over a possible sale and there were "viable buyers" out there.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Call to 'take over' Tata's pension fund  What next for Tata Steel workers?  Steel v banks - Why they're different when it comes to a government bail-out  The business secretary also defended his handling of the crisis and rejected claims the UK had been too easy on China over steel dumping.  Labour said ministers seemed "unaware" of the severity of the crisis.  Mr Javid has been under fire for being in Australia at the time that Tata announced its intention on Tuesday to sell Port Talbot and its other UK assets, putting at least 15,500 jobs at risk.  The minister, who returned on Friday morning, said he had "rushed back" amid concerns that there might only be weeks to safeguard the plant's future but had since been reassured by Tata that more time would be allowed to find a buyer.  Asked by workers if he would do everything he could to save their livelihoods, he did not give a firm guarantee but said: "We are on your side...There is time there."  Mr Javid said steel was "absolutely vital" to the UK's future industrial strategy, insisting that ministers had been in talks with Tata about the future "for a long time".  A crowd of workers chanted "save our steel" as Mr Javid was driven away from the site. He later tweeted that he was "honoured to meet some of the hardest working men and women in Britain".  The government is facing claims that it has blocked an EU measure which would have tackled the "dumping" of cheap Chinese steel in Europe - one of main handicaps facing UK producers.  Ministers opposed an European Commission proposal to lift the "lesser duty rule" cap, which would allow tougher tariffs to be imposed on cheap imported steel, arguing higher tariffs would hit other sectors such as the car industry.  But Mr Javid said this could "not be further from the truth", telling workers that the UK had "been the leader in getting tariffs imposed where evidence exists" of unfair trade practices.  Tata Steel's UK business - which directly employs 15,000 workers and supports thousands of others - includes plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  After a board meeting at its headquarters in Mumbai on Wednesday, Tata confirmed plans to sell its loss-making UK plants. Unless a buyer can be found, thousands of jobs are at risk.  The Port Talbot plant - which employs 4,100 people - is said to be losing £1m a day.  The EU is imposing financial penalties on 16 categories of Chinese steel imports which they believe are being "dumped" on overseas markets - effectively being sold at a loss.  The rate of these duties varies but, controversially, they are more often than not lower than the actual amount by which the products are under-priced.  This is in, large part, down to the so-called "lesser duty" rule.  This rule, which derives from World Trade Organisation regulations, states that it is desirable, although not necessary, for tariffs to be applied at a level "adequate" to remove the financial harm caused to competitors but "at a level lower than the margin of dumping".  UK steel producers and unions argue the EU, by adhering to this rule, has effectively capped steel tariffs at 9% although the European Commission does not recognise this figure.  Both Mr Javid and Prime Minister David Cameron have said nationalisation is "not the answer" for British steelworks but union and opposition figures have criticised the government for failing to do enough to respond to the issue.  Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the trade union Community which represents many steelworkers in Port Talbot, says Mr Javid had been slow to react.  "He must have known there was a potential for there to be a closure announcement last week and he wasn't to be seen."  And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said public ownership may be the only answer to guarantee the industry's future if no buyer came forward.  "I would advocate some form of public intervention, if necessary full public ownership, the crucial thing is to preserve the steel industry in Britain as a basis for our economic growth," he said.  Charles De Lusignan, from the European Steel Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK had not done all it could and, indeed, had been instrumental in blocking a European Commission proposal from 2013 to remove restrictions on higher tariffs.  Steel production makes up 1% of Britain's manufacturing output and 0.1% of the country's economic output.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and tighter rules on procurement to make sure major British projects are obliged to buy British steel.

Copying the aviation industry and even professional cycling may help the NHS save lives, writes Matthew Syed.  7,500 people are estimated to die in English hospitals every year due to avoidable mistakes.  One of these was Joshua Titcombe, who passed away at Furness General Hospital a few days after he was born in 2008 because clinicians didn't spot clear warning signs of major distress, including fast breathing, grunting and a mother who had collapsed from infection moments after the birth.  Little Joshua was cocooned in wires and tubes during his short life.  James and Hoa, his parents, would place a finger into his little hand, and he would grip it tightly. But it was already too late.  As life drained from his body, James and Hoa took it in turns to kiss him, before saying goodbye for the last time.  On his headstone, they wrote: "Our little fighter, always remembered".  A life lost, a family suffering, loved ones bereaved. But each avoidable death is something else, too: a precious learning opportunity.  Many of the deaths suffered in hospitals have patterns, what accident investigators call "signatures".  With open reporting and honest evaluation, new procedures could be put in place to ensure that the same mistake never happens again. But all too often, that's not the case.  Five years before Joshua died, newborn Elleanor Bennett passed away at the same hospital, after staff failed to monitor her heart rate properly.  The consultant told the parents "it was just one of those things" and no independent investigation took place.  When James Titcombe lost his son, he was met with similar evasions. Only because Mr Titcombe campaigned for more information, did he find answers.  The Kirkup report of 2015 found that 11 babies and a mother died in a 'lethal combination of failures' at every level of the system between 2004 and 2013.  Had the lessons been learned earlier, these lives could have been saved.  Today, a new approach to learning will come into legal effect in the NHS, with the establishment of an independent accident investigation branch.  It is modelled on aviation, an industry which has a very different response to failure.  When two planes almost collide in mid-air - a near-miss event - both pilots can submit a report.  These reports are statistically analysed to learn the lessons to prevent an accident before it has even happened.  And when a crash does happen, there are two almost indestructible black boxes (data recorders) that can be probed to learn the lessons.  In 1978, for example, a plane crashed in suburban Portland, Oregon, after the pilot had become focused on a malfunctioning light bulb, but lost focus on dwindling fuel reserves, which ultimately caused the accident.  On the surface, it looked like human error, but the black box investigation found uncanny similarities with other accidents.  It turned out that this was not a problem with the specific pilot, but with the limits of human perception.  New protocols were immediately introduced that addressed this problem.  These were designed to create a more structured division of responsibilities amongst the crew so that they could not become fixated on the wrong problem, and to improve communication.  What happened? Accidents of this kind disappeared overnight.  Ten people died on the Portland flight, but the learning opportunity saved many thousands more.  Viewpoint: How creativity is helped by failure  Viewpoint: Should we all be looking for marginal gains?  Today, aviation is arguably the safest form of transportation. Last year the accident rate had dropped to a low of only four fatal crashes from a total of 37.6 million flights.  Independent investigation is at the heart of this process. Professionals are given every reason to cooperate, because they know that investigations are not about finding scapegoats, but learning lessons.  Indeed, professionals are given a legal safe space so they speak up honestly, and can be penalised only where negligence or malevolence is proven.  Independent investigation and safe space protection are equally vital in healthcare.  Staff must be assured that when mistakes are caused by defective processes, they can speak up without being scapegoated.  Only by combating the "blame culture" in the NHS can transparency and meaningful change take place.  Hospitals that have developed a culture of open reporting have produced outstanding results.  The number of malpractice claims against the University of Illinois Medical Center, for example, fell by half in two years.  Virginia Mason, a hospital in Seattle, has seen a fall in insurance liability premiums of a staggering 74%.  As Gary Kaplan, its chief executive, put it: "We have a system that learns the lessons so that we can turn weaknesses into strengths".  This is about more than healthcare and aviation, however.  Consider, for example, how the success of British sport has been driven by a similar commitment to continual improvement.  In cycling, for example, there is a constant emphasis on discovering weaknesses so they can be turned into strengths.  When Sir Dave Brailsford became head of British cycling, he was driven by insatiable curiosity to improve every single process.  So, he tested the bike design in a wind tunnel and tweaked it for a gain in aerodynamic efficiency.  He transported mattresses from stage to stage during the Tour de France for a marginal improvement in sleep quality.  He had the team use antibacterial hand gel to cut down on the risk of infection. The accumulation of these "marginal gains" has turned British cycling into the envy of the world.  If these sound like trivial issues, consider that until recently up to 60,000 deaths were caused annually in the United States by central line infections.  Only through proper investigation was it discovered that a key factor was clinicians failing to put sterile dressings over the catheter site; the medical equivalent of not using antibacterial hand gel.  The introduction of a five-point checklist - a marginal change - saved 1,500 lives over 18 months in the state of Michigan alone.  As a writer, I have seen the importance of a progressive culture again and again.  Indeed, I wrote a book on the subject and, as a consequence, was invited by the Secretary of State for Health to help draft the proposals that come into force today.  The vast majority of NHS staff are diligent and heroic and have been long let down by a culture of blame.  Independent investigation is a crucial first step to drive down the avoidable errors that kill 150 people every week.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35909117	1966: Owen and Heseltine go to Westminster	I'm never happier than when rummaging around in the BBC archives.  Most of it these days is on computer. In 1990, when I joined as a trainee in Bristol, regional television had only stopped using film the year before.  With the help of our two great librarians at the time, among the hundreds of film cans, I discovered two programmes produced to mark a major event which took place 50 years ago this week, the general election held on 31 March 1966.  "Seven for Westminster" and "Seven at Westminster" were broadcast a few months apart to viewers living in the west country and on the south coast.  They did something which is common now but was quite unusual back then: identifying newly elected MPs and following them as they adjusted to their new life. Each was broadcast only once, and has never been seen since.  Among the seven captured at the start of their parliamentary careers are David Owen, later Foreign Secretary and one of the defectors from Labour who founded the SDP; and the future deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, who helped to bring down Margaret Thatcher.  Armed with the archive of their younger selves I spoke to both of them.  Film of the 27-year-old new MP with his parents in their garden brought back memories for Lord Owen of his father's unintended contribution to his career.  David Owen secured the Labour nomination at a party meeting where, he says, Betty Boothroyd - later Speaker of the House of Commons - "made by far the best speech".  A clutch of women members, though, reassured Owen they had voted for him anyway because they were patients of Dr Owen senior.  Still, he maintains he wasn't expecting to become an MP in 1966; it was only when, after a prime ministerial visit a week before polling day, an aide of Harold Wilson waved goodbye and said "see you in Westminster" as the train pulled out of Plymouth Station, that he realised his medical career was about to be interrupted.  He says he only stopped looking at job adverts in the British Medical Journal after the 1979 election, when he finally accepted he wouldn't be going back.  The second film includes pictures of David Owen posing on the steps of the Ministry of Defence with his new boss, a junior defence minister.  When I asked Lord Owen about his rapid promotion, he told me it happened within days of his election; and the reason that he was chosen may have had something to do with the good dinner the minister received when he visited the constituency; apparently David Owen's father had been very generous with the Plymouth Gin.  Whatever the explanation, Owen's appointment as a Parliamentary Private Secretary gave him the ear of ministers in a department whose decisions directly affected his constituents, many of whom worked in the dockyard at Devonport.  "I can speak to anyone from the Prime Minister down," he told the interviewer in 1966.  As for the restriction of party discipline - something he would strain against as Labour lurched leftwards after its election defeat in 1979 - the young Owen seems to have regarded it as part of the job.  "I've got to accept the discipline of the group. This is politics; if you don't like compromise, don't become a politician".  In the light of his later defection to the SDP, I asked Lord Owen whether his view had changed.  "No, I can honestly say not," he told me. He said his loyalty was to Labour values even as the party itself veered away from them.  "I continued to represent the Labour cause until 1992 [the year he retired from the House of Commons] … social democrat was compatible with being Labour."  That will probably irritate quite a lot of members of the Labour Party who shared his outlook in 1981, but stuck with the party rather than join the SDP.  "Do you still feel Labour?" I asked.  "'Nearly' is the real human answer to that," he replied.  Michael Heseltine never changed parties, but even in his earliest days as an MP there were signs of the independent streak that, for a while, would derail his political career.  The new Member for Tavistock told the narrator of "Seven for Westminster" he was worried about "the sinister risk of compromise", of doing as the party wants rather than sticking to his own view.  It's hard not to see these remarks through the prism of Lord Heseltine's cabinet resignation 20 years later, his leadership challenge to Mrs Thatcher, and, of course, the pro-European Union views, which on occasion left him looking isolated.  "I'd forgotten it, but strongly subscribe to it", he says today. "I was not going to be a 'yes man'".  Despite their party differences, David Owen and Michael Heseltine had things in common; trying to maintain careers in London (one in medicine, the other in publishing), make their mark in Parliament and nurse constituencies hundreds of miles away.  Lord Heseltine recalls journeys in a Morris or Austin car, crammed with his wife, three children, a cat and a bird in a cage.  It took ten hours to travel from London to Tavistock, his constituency on Dartmoor - "and the cat was sick".  In the films, Heseltine, complete with trademark shoulder length hair, exudes confidence, speaking directly to the camera rather than the interviewer. Today, he admits that he didn't always feel in control.  In one film, he is standing in a milking parlour, immaculate in a three piece suit, hands clasped behind his back, earnestly attentive as the farmer explains about the risk of brucellosis.  "I look", he says now "like a man from Mars".  He says fitting in was important for a new MP, especially one who, as the narrator in 1966 drily observed, "is not a countryman".  There is no doubt that the 32-year-old publishing boss did try to make an impression on his rural constituents - perhaps too hard.  "Seven at Westminster" includes a glorious sequence of the young MP towing a caravan into a village with "Heseltine" emblazoned on its side.  This was his mobile constituency surgery, an attempt to reach voters who would not otherwise be able to bring their problems to him.  Half a century later, Lord Heseltine describes it as a "terrible, terrible mistake".  People had turned out enthusiastically on his first visit, Lord Heseltine says, but by the third or fourth they had completely lost interest.  Worse, he was stuck with it because he feared if he stopped the village visits, people would say "he's lost interest, he doesn't care, we never see him".  Only when his seat was abolished in 1974 and he moved to Oxfordshire did he stop.  "I didn't take the idea to Henley", he deadpans.  In the two films from 1966, images of how elections used to be fought - the daytime declarations from town hall balconies, for example, because few were daft enough to declare results in the middle of the night - contrast with reminders of how little has changed.  Dr Owen - "rather serious but one of Labour's rising stars", as he is described in one of the films - describes a feeling that would sound familiar to any MP today.  "Overnight", he complained in 1966, "I went from being respected as a doctor to being regarded with cynical denigration".  Today, his view is somewhat different.  "A very large number of people thought I'd gone down in the world and that upset me in a way. This is a very healthy thing in a democracy".	politics

The research, led by scientists from Imperial College London and published in The Lancet, compared body mass index (BMI) among almost 20 million adult men and women from 1975 to 2014.  It found obesity in men has tripled and more than doubled in women.  Lead author Prof Majid Ezzat said it was an "epidemic of severe obesity" and urged governments to act.  The study, which pooled data from adults in 186 countries, found that the number of obese people worldwide had risen from 105 million in 1975 to 641 million in 2014.  Meanwhile the number of underweight people had risen from 330 million to 462 million over the same period.  Global obesity rates among men went up from 3.2% in 1975 to 10.8%, while among women they rose from 6.4 % in 1975 to 14.9%.  This equates to 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women in the world in 2014, the study said.  The research also predicted that the probability of reaching the World Health Organization's global obesity target - which aims for no rise in obesity above 2010 levels by 2025 - would be "close to zero".  The clinical definition of obese is a BMI - a measurement that relates weight and height - of 30 kilograms per metre squared (kg/m2).  Prof Ezzati said: "Our research has shown that over 40 years we have transitioned from a world in which underweight prevalence was more than double that of obesity, to one in which more people are obese than underweight.  "Although it is reassuring that the number of underweight individuals has decreased over the last four decades, global obesity has reached crisis point."  "We hope these findings create an imperative to shift responsibility from the individual to governments and to develop and implement policies to address obesity.  "For instance, unless we make healthy food options like fresh fruits and vegetables affordable for everyone and increase the price of unhealthy processed foods, the situation is unlikely to change."  The team also examined the number of people who are underweight, and over the same time period the study suggested the rates had fallen from 14% to 9% in men, and 15% to 10% in women.  Prof George Davey Smith from the School of Social and Community Medicine at the University of Bristol writes in the same journal of the danger of becoming "a fatter, healthier, but more unequal world".  "A focus on obesity at the expense of recognition of the substantial remaining burden of under-nutrition threatens to divert resources away from disorders that affect the poor to those that are more likely to affect the wealthier in low income countries," he said.  Other statistics from the study include:  Jamie Blackshaw, National lead for Obesity and Healthy Weight, Public Health England, said:  "People who are overweight and obese suffer life-changing consequences and it costs the NHS more than £6 billion a year. The causes of obesity are complex and the environment we live in encourages poor diets and low levels of physical activity.  "There is no single solution, we have to address the many factors that drive up obesity levels. We all - government, industry, local authorities and the public - have a role to play in that.  "That's why we're supporting the government to develop its childhood obesity strategy, we're running the world's first national diabetes prevention programme and we're currently piloting, with local councils and Leeds Beckett University, a whole systems approach to tackling obesity."	health

The PM said nationalisation was "not the right answer" after Tata Steel's decision to sell its UK business.  Unions and opposition parties say the government is in "chaos", and want action to save the threatened plants.  Business secretary Sajid Javid has been under pressure as he returns from an official trip to Australia.  Tata Steel's UK business - which directly employs 15,000 workers and supports thousands of others - includes plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  The Port Talbot plant - which employs 4,100 people - is said to be losing £1m a day.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  What next for Tata Steel workers?  Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting at Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the situation at Port Talbot was of "deep concern" and said the steel jobs were "vital" to workers' families and the communities.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said a "more nuanced" solution was needed in recognition of the global oversupply of steel.  "We can't simply ignore that - just continuing to produce steel for which there is not adequate demand isn't the answer," he added.  For all the bold talk, privately ministers are deeply apprehensive about saving the steel industry.  Why? Well, all the options look difficult.  Finding a buyer would be the preferred solution. But with Port Talbot losing £1m a day who would want to take it over?  A worker-management buyout is possible but their turnaround plan would require £300m of investment.  Port Talbot could be "mothballed" to secure more time to find a buyer but that would still mean laying off all but a handful of employees.  And taxpayer support - short of nationalisation - would almost certainly fall foul of EU state aid rules.  But there is perhaps an even more pressing reason ministers are sounding increasingly cautious.  They simply don't know what Tata is up to.  Despite repeated requests ministers have been unable to secure a promise that the steel plants will not be closed within a few weeks.  Ministers insist they will need months to put a rescue plan in place.  Privately some in government fear the reason Tata won't say is because they are not interested in finding a buyer.  Why, they ask, would Tata want to sell their steel plants to a competitor?  In other words, Tata may already have determined the fate of the British steel industry and those who work in it - whatever option the government eventually decides to pursue.  The PM defended the government's handling of the crisis, saying ministers had been working "for months" to save the industry and said the government had taken action on energy costs.  Mr Javid, who cut short a business visit to Australia to return to the UK, has come in for particular criticism for his absence during the crisis - and for taking his daughter with him on the trip.  Labour MP Anna Turley said it gave the impression of the trip "being a jolly", while Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to the Port Talbot plant, said Mr Javid should have travelled to Mumbai for Tata's crunch board meeting on Tuesday "but instead he chose to jet off to Australia".  A source from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said Mr Javid's daughter "was there to spend time with her father" and "he paid for everything" - and dismissed Mr Kinnock's calls for him to consider his position as "ridiculous".  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the UK was in the grip of an "industrial crisis of enormous proportions".  He called for the creation of a steel taskforce and for the government to intervene to save the steel industry like it did the banks during the financial crisis, saying EU state aid rules had not prevented Italy or France from "protecting" their steel industries.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government "should nationalise to stabilise" saying this would involve covering the plant's costs in the short term to help a new buyer turn it around.  Mr McDonnell said the government should "bring forward the support that was expected in this budget and didn't happen" about reducing business rates, which he said were "five to seven times" higher in the UK than Europe.  After days of uncertainty, there are still very few answers for the workers of Port Talbot.  They want to know how long they've got. They want to know if they can pay the mortgage, plan for the future and depend on a pension. But at the moment, nobody can tell them.  There is anger here over how the UK government has handled the situation.  While a delegation of local union reps were able to find a way to Mumbai to lobby Tata, there were no government ministers to be seen there. Likewise, no UK minister has made their way to Port Talbot yet.  Even if, as David Cameron says, there has been work behind the scenes for months, many workers here would like evidence of something more solid.  One worker told me he thinks the government has walked into this "with its eyes wide shut". There have been clouds gathering over this plant for months - but yet when the storm hit there was no protection on offer.  There is still hope here that a buyer can be found - in Port Talbot more than anywhere, they believe fervently in the product and prospect of demand for steel rising in years ahead.  But as the deadline to find a buyer seems to be in weeks rather than years, there is a grudging acceptance that time is against them.  Steel production makes up 1% of Britain's manufacturing output and 0.1% of the country's economic output.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and much tighter rules on procurement to ensure major British projects are obliged to buy British steel.  But it has also been accused of opposing EU moves to impose higher tariffs on Chinese steel entering Europe.  China "dumping" cheap steel on overseas markets is being partly blamed for the problems facing the UK steel industry.  Mr Kinnock called for an immediate injection of government money to ensure the Port Talbot plant keeps going while its future lies in the balance.  A number of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have said the government should not rule out subsidising the industry. This would be in contravention of EU rules restricting so-called state aid.  But venture capitalist Jon Moulton, who tried to rescue MG Cars when it was put up for sale by BMW, told Today saving the plants was "probably mission impossible" as a "very, very large amount of money would need to go in to come up with any chance of a way forward".  There are also warnings that the end of steel production in Port Talbot would severely undermine Britain's defence capability and its status as a leading military power.

Launching his party's campaign in Sheffield, he said there would be no "decent, meaningful opposition" unless the Lib Dems regained ground.  And he called for a return to his party's "community politics" tradition.  Elections take place across the UK on May 5.  As well as the local authority elections in England, polls are also being held for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations as well as to elect a London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.  They represent a first major electoral test for Mr Farron, who replaced Nick Clegg as Liberal Democrat leader last year.  The Lib Dems sustained heavy losses in council elections during the coalition government and were left with just eight MPs after last year's general election.  But Mr Farron said his party was "determined" to recover ground.  "Every election starts nil-nil," he said.  "If you assume you're going to be beaten, you deserve to be beaten."  He said the party's campaign would focus on "defending local services", housing, and "a shared belief in community politics".  He added: "We know we can make a difference in people's lives, and we will never give up fighting for our communities."	politics

The British company said it would not file patents in these countries.  Chief executive Sir Andrew Witty said he wanted to take a "graduated" approach to the company's "intellectual property" based on the wealth of nations around the globe.  Experts have described the plans as "brave and positive".  GSK hopes that by removing any fear of it filing for patent protection in poorer countries it will allow independent companies to make and sell versions of its drugs in those areas, thereby widening the public access to them.  Sir Andrew said he hoped Africa would benefit most from the move.  In accordance with international guidelines set out by the United Nations and World Bank, the company has drawn up a list of 50 countries with a combined population of about 1 billion people, where it has said it will not file for patents.  In what GSK describes as lower middle income countries it will continue to file patents, but will grant licences to generic manufacturers in exchange for a "small royalty".  Sir Andrew added: "The changes we are setting out aim to make it as clear and simple as possible for generic manufacturers to make and supply versions of GSK medicines."  The company has said it also wants to put all its future cancer drugs into a Medicines Patent Pool in an effort to address what it described as "the increasing burden of cancer in developing countries".  The patents pool was established in 2010 and has proved successful in accelerating access to treatments such as HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C through voluntary licensing arrangements, which allow generic versions of GSK's drugs to be made and distributed in poorer countries.  Expanding the pool to include cancer drugs will "add to the wider contribution GSK makes to improve access to effective healthcare around the world", the company said.  Sir Andrew added: "The experience GSK has with the Medicines Patent Pool for Tivicay - our newest HIV medicine and one of our most commercially successful products - gives us confidence that increasing access, incentivising innovation appropriately and achieving business success can go hand in hand."  GSK said it would continue to seek full patent protection in richer parts of the world.  Prof Raymond Hill, former President of the British Pharmacological Society, said GSK's plans set a precedent for other major pharmaceutical companies to follow.  He said: "This is a brave and positive step towards broadening the access to important new medicines in the developing world.  "The impact of this move on the treatment of cancer and other diseases in each individual country will depend on whether there is a local adequate healthcare infrastructure that will allow the safe use of powerful new drugs in an appropriate group of patients.  "Many new cancer drugs are most valuable when used in sub-groups of patients identified by advanced diagnostic techniques that may not be available."  Prof Alan Boyd, from the Royal Colleges of Physicians, described the plans as "good news" and "significant"  He added: "Access to medicines for patients on a global basis is vital and it is good to see an innovative approach like this to ensure this happens."	health

The review shows only 16 of 142 hospital sites in England offer specialists on site 24/7.  NHS experts acknowledge steady improvements in the last two years, but warn there is still work to do.  It's the first review since the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway was scrapped.  The Liverpool Care Pathway was phased out amid criticisms it had been misused as a tick-box exercise, leaving some patients without food and water.  In its place a series of guidelines has suggested moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach, instead focusing on individual care.  This report, led by the Royal College of Physicians, shows there have been improvements in all areas.  Researchers found, for example, that communication with patients and relatives had improved.  But there were still a number of concerns.  In 18% of more than 9,000 patient notes researchers examined, there was no written evidence to suggest that do-not-resuscitate decisions had been discussed with relatives or friends.  And in around 3,000 notes there was no evidence that the patient's ability to eat and drink had been assessed on the last day of life.  But the researchers' main concern was that many patients and doctors did not have full access to on-site palliative care specialists at evenings and weekends.  The majority of hospitals did offer a specialist telephone helpline at all times and 53 of 142 hospital sites offered face-to-face palliative care on Monday to Sunday between 9am to 5pm.  But for 26 trusts there was no record of face-to-face specialist palliative care involving doctors at any time.  Study-lead Dr Sam Ahmedzai said: "We know that most front-line doctors and nurses giving end-of-life care do it to a very good standard.  "But the problem happens when things start to go wrong and often they go wrong out-of-hours in the middle of the night and at weekends.  "Then doctors and nurses who may be inexperienced need to be able to access specialists in palliative care."  He says without this, patients with complex problems may not get the care they need.  Julie Coombes' father found out he had bowel cancer in May 2015. He was in and out of hospital for three months. But Ms Coombes, 33, from Plymouth, says her father didn't feel he had good care there. She says his symptoms and sickness couldn't be controlled, so the family decided to take him out of hospital to die at home.  She said: "While he was in hospital the palliative care team came for about five minutes, while he was in his bed with everyone around and just said you are going to die.  "Apart from that we did not get any leaflets or any help... It is not something I would want anyone else to experience."  Dr Kevin Stewart of the Royal College of Physicians said he was encouraged by the improvements.  But he added: "We are disappointed that there are still major deficiencies in the provision of specialist palliative care at nights and weekends by many trusts; patients and their families deserve the same level of service whatever the day of the week."  Dr Adrian Tookman, clinical director of the charity Marie Curie, which part-funded the review, said: "We can't ignore the fact that the vast majority of dying people and those close to them still have limited or no access to specialist palliative care support when they need it in hospital. This is not right, nor good enough.  "Care of the dying has no respect for time, so if we are to deliver a consistent seven-day service by 2020, it is critical that funding is directed towards recruiting and training doctors and nurses to provide specialist care now."  Dr Tookman told BBC Breakfast there was also "an organisational issue", over how managers supported services within hospitals.  He acknowledged the difficulties for families of patients but said they had to "speak up and demand the right care".  Amanda Cheesley of the Royal College of Nursing told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that end-of-life care raised complex issues and among nurses there was "still a fear of doing the wrong thing".  NHS England, which commissioned the review, welcomed the improvements, but said it was clear that more could be done.  A spokesperson added: "Although this audit presents a snapshot of end-of-life care within NHS hospitals, there are clear variations in the support and services received - and there are areas where improvements must continue to be made."	health

In return, the US will send a different type of used uranium to Europe where it will be used to help diagnose cancer.  The BBC's James Landale said the PM's aim was to show that it is possible to think differently about how to dispose of nuclear waste.  But Friends of the Earth said any transatlantic transportation of nuclear waste was a risk it advised against.  Mr Cameron will travel to the US later to announce the agreement at a summit on civil nuclear security in Washington.  He will tell world leaders that Britain will transport 700kg of highly enriched uranium to the US from the Dounreay storage facility in Scotland.  Officials said this would be the largest ever such movement of nuclear waste, which the US has more capacity to store and process.  In return, a different form of used uranium will be transported from America to the European Atomic Energy agency (Euratom) where it will be turned into radio isotopes that are used to detect and diagnose cancer.  Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "Only the nuclear industry could think it was a good idea to risk swapping large quantities of one of the most dangerous materials on the planet across the Atlantic.  "Europe is littered with plenty of highly radioactive waste from both reactors and weapons - there cannot possibly be a need to be importing any more from the US, or for us to be sending ours to them.  "Nuclear waste should be dealt with as close to where it is produced as possible rather than risking transporting it in ships or planes. The consequences of an accident during transit would be horrific."  At the fourth Nuclear Security summit, to be chaired by US President Barack Obama, Mr Cameron will also announce Britain and the US are to hold a joint exercise to test both countries' ability to prevent cyber attacks on their nuclear stations and waste facilities.  The prime minister will offer British expertise to countries including Japan, Turkey, South Korea and Argentina which have asked for advice on how best to protect their nuclear plants.  And he will commit £10m to be spent on civil nuclear security worldwide.  During the biennial summit, first held in 2010, heads of government will also consider their response to the nightmare scenario of terrorists creating and using a dirty bomb.	politics

They hope this will give younger patients access to newer, more personalised medicines and further improve survival rates.  The new test analyses changes in 81 different cancer genes.  Scientists say it should lead to "a more level playing field", and accelerate children's access to important new drugs.  The testing is based at the Royal Marsden NHS Hospital in London and will reach 400 children from around the UK over the next two years.  The development of the test has been funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR).  A charity called Christopher's Smile - set up by a couple whose only child died from an aggressive brain tumour just before his sixth birthday - also provided more than £300,000.  Karen and Kevin Capel, Christopher's parents, said: "This is the first real step towards personalised cancer medicine for children.  "Christopher was treated for a generic kind of tumour. Hopefully children in the future will know exactly what kind of tumour they have.  "It almost felt like the treatments were going to kill our son, rather than the cancer.  "He had been a healthy, happy, very sporty four-year-old. But he turned into a child who couldn't speak or feed himself, and lost a huge amount of weight.  "He wasn't the child he'd grown into at the age of diagnosis. We're striving to get away from this for other children."  Cancer tumours are rare in children so, without a big patient population, there is less of an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials.  This means they risk missing out on innovative treatments which target the cancer cells, leaving healthy ones alone.  Prof Louis Chesler, who is leading the genetic testing research, said: "Children often don't have equal access to the most modern and potentially beneficial cancer drugs.  "The cost of developing these gene-targeted drugs is very high. They tend to go to adults first, where more people are being treated and results can be seen more quickly.  "This test is an incredible advance, because it will define all the genetic changes in the tumour with great clarity.  "That gives clinicians an enormously powerful tool - helping them pick the right drugs for children, and establishing that they are effective as quickly as possible.  "And children's cancers are genetically more simple than adult ones, so ultimately these drugs have a chance of being more effective in children."  The test aims to give scientists and doctors detailed genetic information about a child's tumour within a few weeks of diagnosis.  It will enable them to make a stronger case for using targeted drugs on some young patients, possibly saving them from the side-effects associated with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Jack Daly, 14, from Wokingham, survived a brain tumour which was detected when he was seven.  Radiotherapy helped save his life - but has left damaging after-effects.  Jack said: "My motor skills aren't very good. I have to have help getting dressed for school.  "My balance isn't very good - I'm clumsy and fall over. I struggle at school, and with friendships sometimes."  Jack and his mother Helen have supported the Capels with their fundraising - and hope the test will make a huge difference to the quality of life for children in the future.  Helen said: "People don't really see there's a problem because Jack's cancer is over. He's not in a wheelchair. He hasn't got bandages on.  "If you look at Jack, he's a regular teenage boy. But underneath there are problems because of brain damage from the treatment."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35931342	General election polls in 2015 'the most inaccurate'	Opinion polls before the 2015 election were among the most inaccurate since surveying began more than 70 years ago, an industry-wide review has suggested.  The British Polling Council research followed the widespread failure to predict last May's majority Tory win.  Surveys did not accurately sample the UK population, and over-represented Labour voters, it says.  The BPC has recommended a series of changes, saying pollsters may wish to randomly select participants in future.  It says "probability sampling" may be a more accurate way of gauging voters' intentions than the current practice of recruiting people in advance to take part on the basis of their likely voting habits.  The majority of polls taken during the five-week general election campaign indicated the Conservatives and Labour, led by David Cameron and Ed Miliband respectively, were neck-and-neck.  This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern.  However the Conservatives secured an overall majority for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their 6.5% margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise.  The BPC, which represents the major survey bodies and issued an interim report into its findings in January, says the Tory win was not foreseen due to "systemic" errors.  Its inquiry said unrepresentative sampling was the primary cause for the polling failures.  It cited the over-representation of Labour voters and under-representation of Tories, with Conservative voters apparently being harder to reach.  There was, it added, an over-reliance on more willing survey respondents and said that too few elderly people being polled could have also played a part.  It also said an inaccurate expectation of a hung parliament may have influenced the result of the election itself.  The report makes 12 recommendations to the way polls are conducted in future.  These include a call for measures to be taken to make sure samples are more representative, and a review into the way in which "don't know" voters are allocated in the results.  It says BPC members should state clearly which variables were used to weight data and detail the adjustments made in between polls.  BPC president John Curtice said the organisation will look to implement the report's recommendations on transparency but cannot compel members to comply with following a specific type of methodology.  But he said the BPC will issue a report ahead of the general election in 2020 detailing how companies have changed their sampling and weighting procedures.  "The BPC recognises that simply saying 'well okay, it's all fine, everybody go off and do their own thing' may not be thought of as an adequate response to what happened in 2015," Prof Curtice said.  Southampton University professor of research methodology Patrick Sturgis, who chaired the research for the BPC, said the report should not be used to "bash the polls".  He said "we still think that the polls are really the only show in town for forecasting election results".	politics

Labour has called for MPs to return to Westminster to discuss the future of the Port Talbot steelworks after Tata Steel's decision to sell the plant.  Jeremy Corbyn told workers there they were "not expendable on the altar of a global corporation" and urged ministers to act now to protect the industry.  David Cameron will chair a meeting of senior colleagues on Thursday.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid is returning early from an official trip to Australia to lead the government's response although it is not clear whether he will attend Thursday's meeting.  Mr Javid, who arrived in Sydney on Tuesday for what was due to be a three-day trade visit, said it was vital steelmaking continued at Port Talbot but played down talk of the business and Tata Steel's other remaining UK assets being taken into public ownership, saying there were "buyers out there".  Ministers say they are considering "all options" for the Port Talbot plant after owners Tata Steel said it wants to sell it and the rest of its loss-making UK business.  The Welsh Assembly has been recalled to discuss the crisis, and will meet on Monday. Parliament is due to return on 11 April after the Easter recess.  Late on Tuesday, after a board meeting in Mumbai, Tata Group said it planned to sell the UK steel business, asking its European holding company to "explore all options for restructuring".  The decision also affects workers at its other UK plants, including Rotherham, Corby and Shotton. There has been no specific mention of these plants from the government.  Ministers are concerned Tata could seek to close the Port Talbot plant within weeks if a buyer is not found.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and much tighter rules on procurement to ensure major British projects are obliged to buy british steel.  During times when MPs are not sitting, the Speaker can, if asked by the government, decide to recall the House of Commons. Recent examples include:  Labour shadow business secretary Angela Eagle told BBC News the government should step in and buy the steel plant's strategic assets to ensure they are "kept for the nation" if no buyer can be found.  "The government should know that if this industry is left to die it will cost a lot more in the long run… It will devastate those communities," she added.  During his visit to Port Talbot, Mr Corbyn said the livelihoods of thousands of workers were at stake and called on the government to guarantee that steel made in Port Talbot was used in public procurement projects, such as the railways and construction.  He also called on the Chinese government to end its "disgraceful" dumping of cheap steel in European markets, saying the practice was against world trade regulations.  Mr Javid insisted that he had been in contact with Tata Group executives and believed a buyer could be found for its UK business, hinting that the UK would be willing to provide "commercial support" to facilitate a deal.  No 10, meanwhile, said its focus was on "finding a long-term sustainable future for steel making at Port Talbot and across the UK" and Parliament would not be recalled.  "Ministers will continue to hold briefings to update representatives of other parties... but we have no plans to recall Parliament," a Downing Street spokesman said.  There are a growing number of Conservative MPs saying the government should step in and intervene if a buyer could not be found.  Tom Pursglove - whose Corby constituency includes one of the Tata plants - said he was "one of the biggest free-market Conservatives you will find", but added: "I don't think we should rule anything out," saying the industry was of vital economic interest.  The MP said the UK needed to ensure it retained a steel industry for self defence, so in any future war the UK could manufacture its own armaments.  If Britain were to leave the EU it would certainly have greater freedom to impose anti-dumping tariffs. But Britain's steel industry is closely tied to the EU - exporting some three million tonnes of steel products last year.  Outside the EU, the British steel industry could itself face punishing tariffs, depending on what sort of deal could be negotiated.  It is worth noting that many of the measures the steel industry is seeking could be implemented by the British government: lower business rates, a relaxation of carbon emissions targets for heavy manufacturers, more compensation for high energy prices, and a commitment that British steel is used in major construction projects.  But the future of British steel has already become another important issue in the debate over whether we would be better off in or out of the European Union.  David TC Davis, chairman of the Commons Welsh Affairs Select Committee and a former British Steel worker, said he "wasn't against the idea at all".  "We do need to have a viable steel industry in this country, it's very important from a defence point of view. I'm perfectly open-minded about that but it's got to be profitable in some way," he told Radio 4's World at One.  The European Commission said the UK government had not been in contact regarding the possibility of state intervention.  Cheap steel imports from other countries, such as China, have been partly to blame for the crisis. Tata Steel has also cited the high manufacturing costs in the UK.  Tata announced more than 1,000 job cuts, including 750 in Port Talbot, in January. Last October, it said nearly 1,200 jobs would go at plants in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35927542	UK steel industry and the EU debate	Conservative MP Tom Pursglove is delivering a letter to the prime minister this afternoon calling on the government to ignore EU rules on state aid and consider nationalising the steel industry.  As a prominent campaigner for Britain to leave the EU, it is no surprise that he believes Britain would be in a better position to protect the steel industry if we were not bound by EU rules.  Those on the other side of the referendum debate point out that the EU is our most important market for steel, with more than half of our steel exports going to the EU and more than two thirds of our imports coming from it.  The EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager summed up the rules earlier this year.  She said: "EU countries and the Commission have put in place strict safeguards against state aid to rescue and restructure steel companies in difficulty.  "This avoids harmful subsidy races between EU countries and that uncontrolled state aid in one EU country can unfairly put at risk thousands of jobs across the EU", adding: "EU state aid rules enable member states to for example support research activities or relieve energy costs of steel companies".  Whilst it is technically true that outside the EU the UK government would be free to nationalise and subsidise the steel industry, it seems highly unlikely that a Conservative government would want to permanently re-nationalise such a loss-making business.  Out campaigners and steel industry representatives agree that EU anti-dumping measures are inadequate to prevent the Chinese dumping low-cost steel into the market.  The Lesser Duty rule caps tariffs at 9%. UK Steel, the trade association for the steel industry, says this has little effect when heavily-subsidised Chinese steel is sold at 66% of cost price. Ministers have argued against lifting the cap, saying higher tariffs would hit other sectors such as the car industry.  UK Steel does not accept the government's argument on this, pointing out that other EU countries such as France and Germany, which both have important car manufacturers, are in favour of lifting it.  If Britain were to leave the EU it would certainly have greater freedom to impose anti-dumping tariffs. But Britain's steel industry is closely tied to the EU - exporting some three million tonnes of steel products last year.  Outside the EU, the British steel industry could itself face punishing tariffs, depending on what sort of deal could be negotiated.  It is worth noting that many of the measures the steel industry is seeking could be implemented by the British government: lower business rates, a relaxation of carbon emissions targets for heavy manufacturers, more compensation for high energy prices, and a commitment that British steel is used in major construction projects.

It means the disease is not thought to be a public health threat to countries outside of those affected in West Africa.  A small cluster of cases are still occurring in Guinea, but Sierra Leone and Liberia have not had any in months.  But experts say countries must remain vigilant for new flare ups of Ebola.  There have been 12 of these to date - the most recent on 17 March in Guinea. The WHO says countries have been able to react to these clusters quickly to contain them.  And all original chains of Ebola transmission have ended in the three West African countries that were plagued by the disease.  Ebola is spread by close physical contact. The virus is carried in bodily fluids - blood, vomit and saliva - which means people who care for the sick are vulnerable to catching the infection.  It has also been detected in the semen of male survivors, and the WHO says national and international efforts must be intensified to ensure such men can have their semen checked to know if they might still be able to spread the infection.  And work must continue on the use of Ebola vaccination for intimate and close contacts of those survivors who still carry the virus, says the WHO.  But there should be no restrictions on travel and trade with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - any such measures should be lifted immediately, it says.	health

The presidents of 22 different Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties say patient welfare must come first.  They are asking both sides to "step back from the brink" and re-enter negotiations.  They say ministers should hold off imposing the controversial contract.  "We believe that this is essential if the current impasse is to be broken and progress made in resolving this extremely damaging stand-off for the benefit of all NHS stakeholders, particularly our patients and trainees," says the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.  Meanwhile, more than 1,000 medics have signed a letter asking the Prime Minister to intervene and stop the new junior doctor contract from going ahead.  Among the signatories is GP Clare Gerada, former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners.  The letter warns that if the dispute continues "many more doctors will follow the current trend and leave the country to work abroad as they feel disillusioned and unhappy with how they are being treated by your government."  There are two further periods of planned strikes.  The first will begin at 08:00 on 6 April for 48 hours when junior doctors will refuse to offer routine care but will provide emergency cover - similar to a Christmas Day service.  All-out stoppages are then planned to take place from 08:00 to 17:00 on 26 and 27 April.  This would be the first time doctors have removed cover from areas such as A&E and intensive care.  Consultants will have to be drafted in from other hospital departments to staff emergency care, potentially causing huge disruption to routine services.  Junior doctors' leaders are objecting to plans to introduce a new working contract in England.  They say the changes will lead to unsafe shift patterns, harm morale and worsen recruitment and retention of staff.  The health secretary says the change will help deliver better care at weekends.  A Department of Health spokesperson said they had hoped to have negotiated an agreement by now, but since talks had broken down they "no choice" but to proceed with the contract.  Prof Derek Bell, President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, said: "The junior contract dispute should not have escalated to the current position with the threat of imposition by the UK Government and a full strike planned by junior doctors, who are understandably aggrieved with the situation.  "I have asked the Prime Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency as the only solution that will benefit patients and the long term sustainability of the NHS and its workforce is a negotiated solution."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35915932	LGA: Living wage 'could put care services at breaking point'	Care services for the elderly and disabled could hit "breaking point" when the new National Living Wage comes into effect, councils say.  The Local Government Association estimates it could cost councils at least £330m in 2016-17 to cover increased contract costs.  It wants £700m of new government funding earmarked for social care by 2020 to be brought forward.  The government said it was offering more financial support to councils.  The government is allowing councils to raise council tax by 2% to help meet the rising costs of social care, under plans announced in the 2015 Autumn Statement.  According to Local Government Association (LGA) figures, this could bring in about £372m in 2016-17.  But it warns this could be wiped out by meeting the costs of the new £7.20 National Living Wage, for those aged over 25, which comes into force in April.  The LGA says the increased costs of contracts for home care and residential care providers could cost councils a minimum of £330m in 2016-17.  "The cost of implementing it will significantly add to the growing pressure on services caring for the elderly and disabled which are already at breaking point," said councillor Izzi Seccombe, the LGA's community wellbeing spokeswoman.  "A lack of funding is already leading to providers pulling out of the publicly-funded care market and shifting their attention towards people who are able to fully fund their own care.  "We know that care home and domiciliary care providers cannot be squeezed much further."  The government said care workers would benefit from the National Living Wage, and added that it was making up to £3.5bn available for councils to meet social care costs.  A spokesman said: "The new National Living Wage (NLW) is an essential part of moving to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society, where work always pays and the majority of households are better off.  "The NLW will benefit hundreds of thousands of care workers for the work they do and we are offering more financial support to councils to invest in that work - with access to up to £3.5bn to spend on social care."	politics

When he was about 18 months old, he was diagnosed with toddler diarrhoea, put on a low-fibre diet and his mum Caroline was told he would grow out of the problem.  But the diarrhoea continued and so did the accidents.  "He would go to nursery with a bag of spare clothes because he had two or three accidents a day," Caroline says.  "As he got older he started to realise that wasn't normal."  With no sign of any improvement after almost two years, Caroline sought a second opinion and Jack was diagnosed with chronic constipation. The diarrhoea had just been a symptom of a more serious underlying problem.  Finally, with advice from children's continence charity ERIC, Jack was put on a course of medication which helped to clear the contents of his bowel and then a dose which would help to keep his system moving in the future.  Within two or three months, his mum says, he was "all clear", just in time for starting primary school in Wiltshire, but they had been dealing with a misdiagnosis for nearly two years.  One particular incident brought it home to Caroline just how awful Jack's problem had become and how traumatic it felt for him.  "He'd locked himself in the toilet with one of his baby brother's nappies and was trying to put it on..."  Constipation in children is not unusual - children's continence charity ERIC says between 5% and 30% of children suffer from it, yet parents complain that the condition often goes unrecognised.  It says GPs are failing to diagnose the problem properly and not referring to a specialist when they should - and sometimes the advice they give is wrong.  Rhia Weston, from ERIC, says children should be encouraged to drink more water, prescribed a laxative to clear them out and then put on a 'maintenance dose'.  Changing their diets and adding more fibre may work, but it is not going to solve everything.  "More often it's to do with dehydration because the child is not drinking enough at school and is possibly holding on and not going to the toilet at school," she says.  "Or it may be caused by a fever or medication. They can experience one painful poo and then it becomes a vicious cycle of not wanting to go."  Although constipation can be caused by physical problems too, she said it was important to make sure children got a decent amount of exercise and had a toilet routine in place - for example, sitting on the toilet 20 minutes after each meal.  Dr Anton Emmanuel, consultant neuro-gastroenterologist at University College London, agrees that traditionally the emphasis has been on increasing fibre intake.  "But that doesn't work for everyone. If people have tried that and it doesn't work, they need to try something else," he says.  One new therapy - called biofeedback - focuses on re-training the body's functions to work normally, rather than relying on the laxative effect of drugs.  Biofeedback uses special sensors connected to computers to measure bodily functions, even ones we are not aware of, and this information helps patients find out how their bodies are actually working.  By retraining the pelvic floor and sphincter to work the right way, the idea is that normal bowel control can be re-learnt and restored.  Dr Emmanuel explains: "Therapies have failed because the pelvic floor is tightly shut. People avoid loos, they hold on, and so the pelvic floor doesn't relax."  He says that, over three or four biofeedback sessions, people can see improvements by doing pelvic floor exercises, among others.  Tammie Cherry, from Kent, has experienced the positive effects of biofeedback after nearly 30 years of suffering with chronic constipation, which often led to painful stomach cramps and terrible episodes of diarrhoea.  She first noticed the problems around the age of 10 but was told she would grow out of it if she ate more fibre in her diet - but that didn't work.  She was eventually referred to St Mark's Hospital in Harrow and treated at the Biofeedback Unit. After two months of a tailored diet while following specific stomach exercises, she had normal bowel movements and some control over her life again.  "I can go shopping now, sit down on a bus and go out of the house without being caught short - and I've got no chronic pain. It's fantastic."  Constipation is the second or third most common reason among potty-trained children for going to see the GP, but Dr Emmanuel says it's important to look more deeply.  "Constipation is just a symptom. It can mean different things in different people. We must understand the mechanism of the individual because it's not the same for everyone."  Caroline describes how they had to help Jack retrain his body how to poo which led to a battle of wills and many, many tears.  Now that he is five years old, in Reception class, and in a good toilet routine, he is a very different boy, his mum explains.  "Physically he is much more content and, because his body is working better, he is happier."  Looking back, Caroline knows that with a correct, early diagnosis and some proper support Jack's early years should have been very different.	health

Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham told the BBC there "couldn't be a more serious time" to be strengthening borders, after the Brussels attacks.  But he quoted whistleblowers as saying the Border Force had been told to expect cuts of 6% in both the next financial year and the one after.  The Home Office said funding was being finalised and "all necessary measures" would be taken to secure UK borders.  In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Mr Burnham said making savings now would be a "very serious mistake".  In the wake of the Brussels bombings, the government said it was deploying more Border Force staff to strengthen checks at UK entry points.  But Mr Burnham accused the home secretary of "going to great lengths" to conceal further cuts planned for the agency.  He said it was "highly unusual and should be challenged" for ministers not to have released the Border Force budget with the start of the new financial year only a few days away.  He said the force had "already experienced consecutive years of cuts" and was "stretched to the limit".  "The public has a right to know about the government's plans for the UK border and that is why I call on them to publish these figures without delay and to drop these damaging cuts," he added.  The Home Office said extra money for the force had been promised in the chancellor's Budget this month.  A spokesman said the government had "invested tens of millions of pounds to bolster security at ports in northern France" and would take "all the necessary measures" to maintain the security of the UK's borders.  Mr Burnham said the funding promised in the Budget was for customs activities of the Border Force, to counter smuggling, not for immigration staff.  He called on the government to strengthen the UK's sea, rail and air borders with Belgium, saying British border officials should be deployed to work alongside local staff in Belgian ports, as already happens in Calais.  The Home Office said the Border Force "has the ability to redeploy resources on a national basis, and can allocate funding to address specific pressures when necessary.  "This includes the additional £17m being invested during the next financial year to ease migrant pressures in the Calais region and further strengthen the UK border."  It said it was "not uncommon" for the force's budget to be finalised this close to the financial year and the home secretary would respond to Mr Burnham's letter "in due course".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35892309	Phone app 'bridges treatment gap'	Millions of people around the world are affected by common mental disorders such as depression, emotional stress and suicidal tendencies at some point in their life. Even in the most developed nations, these conditions can go untreated and in some cases, undiagnosed.  The so-called "treatment gap" - where people needing treatment do not get it - is particularly large in India.  In some rural areas there is often just one doctor looking after up to 30,000 people. The doctors are not always psychiatrists and, although they are trained in mental health disorders, they don't always know how to treat these conditions.  But in Andhra Pradesh, one project is trying to circumvent the need for more doctors, by using existing health resources to identify potential patients through a mobile-based app.  The SMARTmh system uses female health workers or Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), to screen people in rural villages in West Godavari district.  ASHAs are government health workers trained to educate and promote health in their communities. Their primary role is to support the government programme on maternal and child health, and also help communities with first aid and sanitation.  But researchers at The George Institute for Global Health India have given them another task - to ask people in villages a series of questions to screen for mental health.  Siddharda Devarapalli, who is part of the team, said: "Local health activists are known to the people and because of the stigma attached to mental health issues, people will be open to the activists and so they will share"  The health workers use a questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). They input the answers into the app that then gives them a result, determining whether the person should be referred to a doctor or not.  The doctor then uses another app to diagnose the patient, and draws up a treatment plan. The ASHAs support the patients during their hospital visits and they also follow up with them to make sure they're taking their medication, if required.  The George Institute has screened 22,000 people in 42 villages in West Godavari. The SMARTmh system has found 5% of the population needs clinical intervention.  Almost all of the patients needing help have never had their condition identified in the past.  Kannan Krishnaswamy, of the George Institute, said: "This is not just an innovation in technology, it is an innovation in process."  For patients like Israyelu Pendem, the system has been a lifesaver. There was a time when he felt he could not go on.  "I was mentally depressed, sleepless, I lost my appetite. I was restless and unstable. I felt that I should leave this world," said Israyelu.  Israyelu lives in a small village in West Godavari. And although he did visit a doctor during the two years he suffered from his symptoms, the treatment did not help him.  A few months ago an ASHA came to his doorstep and asked him some questions. He was referred to a doctor through the SMARTmh system and was eventually diagnosed with depression.  "I was counselled and that motivated me a lot. With that I gained confidence," said Israyelu.  Out of 100 people needing mental health care in India, only 25 receive it. There are many reasons or this gap including low awareness and a lack of trained mental health professionals. Stigma and social beliefs surrounding mental disorders also play a role.  "Common mental disorders were hardly recognised in these parts. They were not even identified as health problems. Many people used to think that it's because of karma or because of some supernatural powers," said Devarapalli.  Such beliefs, Devarapalli says, prevent patients from coming forward or pursuing treatment.  The plan is to expand the system to cover other easily treatable conditions, like blood pressure and diabetes.  Researchers hope eventually a medical mobile platform will guide local doctors and health workers in rural areas to diagnose and give treatments for many conditions.  And by using new technology and training local healthcare workers, they want to be able to improve the health of people living in the most remote parts of India and maybe one day, the world.	health

The scheme run by charity Think Ahead aims to recruit 300 graduates by 2018 to work with nurses and psychiatrists.  They will receive specialist training on supporting individuals and families with mental health problems.  Graduates are paid while training on the job and qualify as social workers a year earlier than normal.  Those who secure a place on the scheme become mental health social workers, working with psychologists, nurses and doctors to support the everyday needs of those with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia.  The scheme, which opened last year, attracted more than 2,300 applicants for 100 places that start in July.  The government funding will provide money for 200 more places by 2018.  Sarah Carr, who chairs the National Service User Network, said: "Support from a social worker with the right skills and expertise can be transformational for people living with mental health problems.  "The programme gives graduates the skills to empower the individuals they work with - so that they can manage their mental health, stand up for their rights, and find their own paths towards personal recovery."  David Niven, a former chairman of the British Association of Social Workers, said the profession had struggled with too many vacancies and caps to local government funding in recent years, while social workers themselves had faced heavy workloads.  He told BBC Radio 5 live he hoped this scheme would strengthen the profession and that it showed recognition from the government of the value of social work.  Mental health minister Alistair Burt said mental health social work was highly skilled, complex work and the funding would mean thousands of people would be helped to lead more independent and fulfilling lives.  "This is a great initiative to attract the brightest and best into the profession," he said.  Think Ahead says one in three families include someone with mental health problems, deeply affecting their lives and their communities.  Lee Brookes, 39, is a business adviser who has had mental health problems for 10 years, including bipolar disorder and an eating disorder.  He says a good, understanding social worker who listens well is invaluable in coping with his illness.  "My current social worker has been fantastic," he says.  "She can tell from my tone of voice whether the conversation needs to carry on or whether she needs to call back later.  "That works so well for me."  Mr Brookes believes developing mental health social workers will help lots of people in the long run because of the support they provide.

The Local Government Association (LGA) has also called on ministers to extend tax breaks on lower-strength 2.8% beers to include ciders and wines.  The call has been welcomed by industry bodies.  The LGA represents 370 councils in England and Wales with responsibility for public health.  The cost to the NHS of dealing with excessive alcohol consumption is estimated to be £3.5bn a year, according to the LGA.  Tony Page, the licensing spokesman for the LGA, said: "Increasing the availability of zero alcohol and weaker strength drinks will help people live healthier lives by helping to control drinking levels and tackle the harm caused by excessive drinking.  "With a new generation of non-drinkers on the rise, there is a growing demand for greater choice in alcohol-free and weaker drinks, with several 'dry bars' opening up across the country.  "Tax breaks for beer have helped fuel a rise in low-strength products. This should now be extended to cider, wine and spirits."  He also said that drinking habits were changing and "brewers needed to capitalise on this by producing a range of different options" for people.  Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that excessive consumption of alcohol is also associated with violent crime.  In just over a half of all instances of violent crime in England and Wales in 2013-14, the victim believed that the perpetrator was drunk.  The LGA says widening the availability of low-strength and alcohol-free drinks would "revitalise pubs, which are closing at a rate of nearly 30 a week, and re-establish them as vibrant centres of communities".  There is also a growing number of non-drinkers, with one in five adults (21%) saying they do not drink alcohol at all - up from 19% in 2005.  A spokesman for the Portman Group - which campaigns for the drinks industry on social responsibility - said: "We welcome this support for lower strength drinks.  "Official statistics show a decade-long decline in harmful drinking in the UK, and alcohol companies are committed to continuing this positive trend."  A spokesman for the British Beer and Pub Association said: "Lower taxes for lower strength drinks is a great idea, and we would support this principle for other drinks categories."  Earlier this year, tough new guidelines were issued on alcohol consumption, which said there was no such thing as a safe level of drinking.  The UK's chief medical officers said new research showed any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer.  Their new advice says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine. And pregnant women should not drink at all.	health

The U-turn came after the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said poppers should not be banned.  Popper-using MP Crispin Blunt led a Commons attempt in January to exempt poppers from what he said would be a "fantastically stupid" ban.  Popular with gay men, "poppers" is the name given to liquid chemicals called alkyl nitrates, which are sniffed.  Last week, the advisory council said its "consensus view is that a psychoactive substance has a direct action on the brain and that substances having peripheral effects, such as those caused by alkyl nitrites, do not directly stimulate or depress the central nervous system".  In a letter responding, Home Office Minister Karen Bradley said: "Having given due consideration, the government agrees with your advice and interpretation of the definition."  She added: "Our understanding is that this approach does not have any further implications for the operation of the act and that other substances that the act intends to cover are not affected.  "We remain confident that the psychoactivity of those substances can be established under the definition in the act.  "We will ask law enforcement agencies to be guided by our agreement with your advice."  The Psychoactive Substances Act will bring in a blanket ban on the production, distribution, sale and supply of "designer drugs".  Sellers will face up to seven years in prison.  There were 11 deaths in England and Wales between 1993 and 2013 where the death certificate only mentioned an alkyl nitrate, according to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs.	politics

A review of the Lords' powers was set up after peers voted down planned tax credits cuts - later axed by ministers.  But its scope has been criticised by two Lords committees who say its proposals would "damage" Parliament's role and should be shelved.  Unlike in the Commons, the Tories do not have a majority in the of Lords.  The review, carried out by ex-Lords leader Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the Lords had over statutory instruments - a form of legislation implemented without Parliament having to pass an Act - and instead limiting them to sending the secondary (or delegated) legislation back to the Commons to "think again".  They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagreed.  But in separate reports published on Wednesday, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Constitution Committee said weakening parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation "would tilt the balance of power away from Parliament… towards government".  Criticising the scope of the review, they said it was "not a proper basis for determining constitutional change" and warned the recommendations "will only damage Parliament's role and reputation".  "A six week review based on informal consultation following highly politicised events in both Houses is not a proper basis for determining constitutional change," the Constitution Committee said.  Secondary or delegated legislation allows the government to make changes to a law without needing to push through a completely new act of Parliament.  This can occur when primary legislation (an act of Parliament) specifies that changes to the law may be delegated to ministers in certain circumstances in future.  It may allow ministers to make technical changes to the law, like altering the level of a fine, but it can also sanction broader changes like fleshing out an act with greater detail.  The cross-party committees said the government should shelve the plans and allow both Houses of Parliament to consider the way in which secondary legislation is scrutinised.  Chairman Lord Lang of Monkton, a Conservative peer, said: "The Strathclyde Review was asked the wrong questions by the government.  "The role of the House of Lords in rejecting the tax credits regulations was not about the House of Lords versus the House of Commons; it was about Parliament scrutinising the government."  Baroness Fookes, chairman of the Delegated Powers Committee, said she welcomed the review for "shining a spotlight - perhaps unintentionally - on the unfortunate tendency of successive governments to leave substantial issues of policy and principle to be dealt with by delegated legislation".  "At best this is sloppy practice, and at worst it gives ministers far too much power to do whatever they want without sufficient scrutiny by Parliament," she added.  She said the committee would be "more demanding" of ministers and demand answers if they "seek substantial and wide powers without adequate explanation".  The review of the Lords' powers has been criticised by the Labour Party, which said it was a "massive over-reaction" to the tax credits defeat and accused ministers of "intimidating" the Lords.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35866245	Birth care variation in hospitals in England 'concerning'	The variation in care women get when giving birth in hospital in England is concerning, experts say.  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' warning follows a review of more than 550,000 births.  It found "substantial variation" in practice between maternity units, and said this may suggest not all women get the best possible care.  Ministers said the NHS was a safe place to give birth but the report would help it improve.  The review - carried out with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - looked at official data on births in 2013-14, excluding non-standard deliveries such as twins, triplets and pre-term babies.  It highlighted different rates of emergency caesarian sections, instrumental deliveries and episiotomies, which is when the area between the vagina and anus is cut.  In some maternity units 8% of mothers needed emergency c-sections, but in others the figure was 15%.  Just under one in five first-time mothers needed help with instruments while giving birth naturally in some units - but in other units this figure rose to almost three in 10.  The number of women who needed an episiotomy ranged from 29% to 44%.  RCOG president Dr David Richmond said: "We are concerned about the amount of variation identified in this report.  "Although the exact causes are difficult to establish, it is paramount that maternity units have information about their services, as well as the ability to compare themselves to the national average and to their peers."  To help with that, the college has collated the results on an interactive website.  Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: "Pregnant women should not have to endure a postcode lottery, and it is unacceptable these variations in maternity care are reported year after year.  "We urge NHS trusts to use this data to examine their practices and ensure the best possible outcomes for mothers and babies."  Health minister Ben Gummer said: "Mothers and their babies deserve the very highest standards of care regardless of where they live.  "The NHS is already a safe place to give birth and by being open and honest about variations in care, RCOG's report will help the NHS to improve."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35869662	Frog foam could deliver drug therapy	Foam made by miniature frogs to protect their eggs could offer a clever way to deliver healing drugs to burns patients, say scientists.  Tough bubbles could trap and deliver medication while providing a protective barrier between the wound dressing and the damaged skin, they believe.  The Strathclyde University researchers have begun making a synthetic version of foam.  They are taking inspiration from the tiny Tungara frog from Trinidad.  After mating, the 5cm-sized amphibians whip up a bubbly nest that protects the spawn for days from disease, predators and weather.  The foam is made of at least six proteins that retain the shape and strength of the nest.  Dr Paul Hoskisson and his colleagues say they have worked out the composition of four of these proteins and have begun mixing their own recipe.  When they loaded their synthetic foam with a dye as a test, they found it released it at a steady rate for up to seven days.  Next they loaded it with an antibiotic drug called vancomycin and found the drug was released and worked as it should on infected laboratory samples, without damaging the health of cells.  But they say they are still some way off creating a foam that is as stable as the one made by the frogs.  Dr Hoskisson said: "I'd say we are about half way there, to making a stable foam. Once we do that, we would then need to test it in patients, but that will take a few years yet."  While foams like these are a long way from hitting the clinic, they could eventually help patients with infected wounds and burns, by providing support and protection for healing tissue and delivering drugs at the same time, said Dr Hoskisson.  The researchers are presenting their early work to the Microbiology Society's Annual Conference taking place in Liverpool.	health

The practice involves using hot objects to pound and massage girls' breasts to try to stunt their growth in the belief it makes them less sexually attractive.  MP Jake Berry said about 1,000 girls in the UK were thought to be affected by the "abhorrent practice".  The government said police could charge culprits with a range of offences.  Home Office minister Karen Bradley said the government was "absolutely committed" to putting a stop to the practice.  But she admitted "certain professionals" still felt reticent about tackling such practices because of "cultural sensitivities" - and said they needed to be given the confidence to take action.  Opening the debate in the Commons, Mr Berry said breast ironing was believed to have originated in Cameroon but cases had also been found in Nigeria, Benin, Chad "and Birmingham and London".  He said it was "hard to prove its extent or prevalence in the UK" because, like female genital mutilation (FGM), the fact the practice "most often carried out by a family member" meant it was "hidden".  According to a UN report, 58% of perpetrators were the victims' own mothers.  The MP for Rossendale and Darwen said girls as young as 10 were subjected to "unimaginable pain and suffering" and exposed to potential health problems including cancer, infection and cysts.  "Hot stones, hammers and spatulas are used twice a day for several weeks or months to stop or delay and in some cases permanently destroy the natural development of the breast," he said.  Culture, tradition and religion were often used to justify the practice, Mr Berry said, adding: "But just as in the case of FGM these words are a thinly veiled excuse for a ritualised form of child abuse." It had "no place in any society", he said.  Mr Berry said 15% of UK police forces had no awareness of breast ironing and 23% of local children's services were not trained to deal with it, with 65% saying they would welcome more guidance.  "If we fail to let them have the tools they require to identify and understand the victims of this crime, we will never be able to tackle it," he told the Commons.  "My understanding is that there is currently no stand-alone crime of breast ironing in the UK, with police and prosecutors relying on the existing pool of criminal offences available to them.  "Just like with FGM, this... is not an adequate protection for young women and girls in our country," the MP added.  Home Office minister Karen Bradley said there was a range of offences available to the police to tackle the crime including common assault, child cruelty and grievous bodily harm.  "What we're talking about is child abuse, it is illegal, it is a crime, it is not acceptable.  "I want to assure the House that the government fully understands this and is absolutely committed to putting a stop to it," she said.  Pressed over the role of schools in tackling such harmful practices, the minister said "there are certain professionals who may feel reticent about this".  She added: "They may feel that somehow there are cultural sensitivities, there are political reasons why they shouldn't go there.  "This is simply not the case and we need to give those professionals the confidence to know that this is something that they should be looking for, that they know what the signs are and that they take action because that is what we all need to do."	politics

The changes had led to a rift in the Tory Party and the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith from the cabinet.  Ahead of the vote, Mr Osborne defended his handling of the economy, but told MPs that where mistakes were made he was ready "to listen and learn".  The Budget was accepted by 310 votes to 275, a government majority of 35.  The government also won a series of votes on specific Budget resolutions, including the cut in capital gains tax.  Opposition amendments to scrap the "tampon tax" and block an increase in VAT on solar panels were accepted by the government without the need for a vote.  Remaining Budget measures will be brought forward in the Finance Bill and other legislation which will be debated after the Easter recess.  The vote came after days of highly charged debate on the Budget, which was overshadowed by the row over disability benefits and the fallout from Mr Duncan Smith's resignation as work and pensions secretary.  In a rare move, the chancellor introduced the final day's debate and confirmed to MPs that he would not proceed with planned cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).  He said the changes, likely to have affected up to 640,000 people, did not "command support".  "I have made it clear that where we've made a mistake, where we've got things wrong, we listen and we learn. That's precisely what we've done," he said.  And he told MPs no further welfare savings were anticipated beyond the £12bn already approved by Parliament towards his target of balancing the books by 2020.  But Labour demanded an explanation as to how Mr Osborne would plug the £4.4bn gap in the Budget left by the rethink.  Former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said he would either have to raid the welfare budget further or "ditch" his self-imposed cap on overall benefits spending.  Mr Osborne said the cost of abandoning the policy could be absorbed because public spending was under control.  Labour also called on the chancellor to apologise for his attempt to introduce the cuts.  And shadow chancellor John McDonnell questioned Mr Osborne's "fitness for the office he now holds".  Ms Osborne was a "political chancer" whose "grubby, incompetent manipulations" could not be defended, he said.  Mr Duncan Smith resigned on Friday over the proposals to cut disability benefits at the same that taxes were being cut for higher earners.  In his resignation letter, he said the latest cuts were a "compromise too far" and flew in the face of David Cameron's and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  In the Commons, Mr Osborne said he was sorry Mr Duncan Smith had resigned and told MPs he was proud of their work together in government.  He praised his former colleague for "helping to make work pay, protecting the vulnerable and breaking the decades-old cycle of welfare dependency".  But the chancellor rejected Mr Duncan Smith's charge that his fiscal targets risked dividing society and that working-age benefit claimants were being unduly penalised by a "desperate search" for savings.  "Without sound public finances there is no social justice," he told MPs.  He said spending on disability benefits would still be higher in 2020 than it was now and 300,000 people with disabilities had found work in the past couple of years.  In separate votes on several Budget resolutions, proposals to cut capital gains tax and increase the insurance premium tax were endorsed by MPs.  Increases in the landfill tax were also passed by the House with a 235 majority, after being approved by English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs by 296 votes to 10 under the "English votes for English laws" procedure.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35875879	Pensioners: Are the untouchables still untouchable?	David Cameron has made a clear commitment to protect and reward Britain's pensioners for as long as he is prime minister. The "triple lock" on pensions, the winter fuel payment, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests, all guaranteed "no question".  It's a promise that comes with a huge price tag, though. A hastily withdrawn official report from the Government Actuary's Department last year suggested the "triple lock" - raising the state pension annually by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5% - has added £6bn extra a year to the benefits bill.  That is a massive additional sum - particularly at a time when the government is insisting the overall welfare budget be reduced by £12bn.  Laura Kuenssberg: No more welfare cuts, for now  Almost every attempt to find the savings within the benefits bill has ended in tears. Cuts to tax credits have been shelved, disability benefits are now protected and the new Work and Pensions Secretary, Stephen Crabb, has promised there are no further planned cuts to the welfare budget.  Even the chancellor's raid on housing associations and local authorities by cutting housing benefit has come back to haunt him, with the postponement of the policy in respect of supported housing projects.  The government has talked itself into a corner and inevitably, questions are being asked as to whether the prime minister's straight-to-camera promise not to touch pensioner entitlements can be sustained.  This afternoon in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Stewart Jackson said pensioner benefits needed to be reassessed. "It's wrong morally I believe to make large-scale transfer of wealth from the young to the old, and I think there has to be a consensus," he said.  Before his resignation, Iain Duncan Smith had argued that universal pensioner benefits should be scrapped in favour of a means-tested system. Winter fuel payments and other pensioner benefits cost close to £3bn a year and the Sun newspaper was among those campaigning to "ditch handouts to rich OAPs".  But Mr Cameron, aware of the political price paid by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg when he went back on his promise to oppose student fees, is adamant that his government will not break its pledge to Britain's pensioners.  This special protection means that, once housing costs are considered, median pensioner incomes are higher than non-pensioner incomes. While young people tightened their belts during the downturn, the over-65s were getting richer.  The result of that is that poverty among pensioners is now lower than among people of working age. It is quite a turnaround - in the 1960s, about 40% of pensioners were living in poverty, compared with less than 10% of under-65s.  The pensioner has become a totemic force in British politics. They vote and their numbers are growing. The over-65s have become almost untouchable.  As David Cameron puts it, "I want older people across this country to know this: for all the decades you've toiled, for the years you've done the right thing - for the rest of your days you will have dignity and security."  The political consequences of getting pensioner policies wrong can be highly damaging.  In 1999, New Labour made what Tony Blair regards as one of the greatest mistakes of his premiership when the basic state pension was increased by inflation - a "derisory" rise of just 75p a week.  It may have been a rise in line with the cost of living, but the government found itself attacked from all sides.  Many Labour supporters blamed Margaret Thatcher for breaking the link between pensions and earnings, and the idea that their own party should continue with the inflation link led to quite a few members sending cheques for 75p to Gordon Brown at the Treasury.  To add insult to injury, the department cashed them.  Labour did eventually restore the earnings link but the coalition went further, introducing the "triple lock".  So pensioners are a powerful lobby group, but the question of whether their level of protection is too great has burst out into the open.  A committee of MPs has launched an inquiry into "intergenerational fairness" - investigating the extent to which government policies, such as the "triple lock", are leading to inequity between the young and old.  "Is it fair and affordable to divert a large and growing sum of public expenditure towards pensioners - regardless of their circumstances - while mainly poor families with children face year-on-year restrictions on their income?" asks committee chair, the veteran Labour welfare reform campaigner Frank Field.  "Can the "triple lock" pension increase pledge be sustainable? Or are these policies necessary to guard against pensioner poverty?"  The committee points out that the group born in the middle of the baby boom (between 1956 and 1961) has been forecast to receive from the welfare state 118% of what they contribute, while recent research shows that younger people are on course to have less wealth at each point in their lives than earlier generations had acquired by the same age.  However, the basic state pension is still far from generous - the most you can currently get is £115.95 per week.  Many would argue that the reduction in pensioner poverty is a cause for celebration, not jealous sniping.  If David Cameron refuses to entertain any change of tack on the commitment to "triple lock" and other pensioner benefits while protecting other spending, the question remains: where is he going to save the missing billions?	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35868436	George Osborne: We listen and learn from mistakes	George Osborne has told MPs he was "sorry" Iain Duncan Smith resigned and was "proud" of their work together.  Defending his handling of the economy ahead of a vote to approve his Budget, the chancellor said Treasury talks with departments had often been "robust".  But where mistakes were made he was ready "to listen and learn", he added.  Labour said Mr Osborne would have to raid the welfare budget further or "ditch" his self-imposed cap on overall benefits spending.  Mr Osborne's Commons performance came after Mr Duncan Smith's post-Budget decision to quit, with a blast at "indefensible" changes to disability benefits.  Mr Osborne confirmed he had dropped planned cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) and said no further welfare savings were anticipated beyond the £12bn already approved by Parliament towards his target of balancing the books by 2020.  But he came under sustained pressure from Labour to explain how he will cover the £4.4bn gap in the Budget left by the rethink.  Former minister Yvette Cooper said Mr Osborne would either have to backtrack on ring fencing welfare or accept he would breach his self-imposed cap on welfare spending, the total limit on the amount of taxpayers' cash that goes on benefits.  "Either he has ripped up his own welfare cap and ditched another big plank of his Budget in just a few days," she said.  "Or he and the work and pensions secretary (Stephen Crabb) have used the most awful weasel words in Parliament and there are still more welfare cuts to come. Either this is chaos or it is a con."  The chancellor told MPs that the disability benefit cuts, likely to have affected up to 640,000 people, did not "command support".  Away from the sound and fury in the Commons this afternoon, and there has been a lot of it, did George Osborne gave even more of a hint that the government is likely to ditch or at least relax the restrictions it has placed on welfare?  Labour backbenchers managed to press him into almost repeating Stephen Crabb's statement a day earlier that the government won't introduce new extra cuts to welfare.  It looks like it will be rather hard for the government to keep its promise to keep welfare spending within its set limits, and the (almost) promise they made this afternoon.  It's clear from the Budget that the government is committed to meet its cap on welfare spending, a total limit on the amount of taxpayers' cash that goes on benefits, by 2020.  It's also clear the government intends to spell out how it will do that this autumn. But when you look at the numbers in the Office for Budget Responsibility's book, it says welfare spending is expected to be more than £3bn over the cap, in 2020.  So if the government really intends to hit the cap they will either have to find more welfare cuts after all, or relax the cap this autumn, or quietly ditch it altogether.  The Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions are yet to answer this question. But it seems politically impossible to go back for more cuts, politically unlikely that Mr Osborne will ditch his beloved welfare cap, so now, more likely than not, that in the autumn the limit will have to be raised again.  But he said he was "proud" of the government's record, insisting that spending on disability benefits would still be higher in 2020 than it was now and 300,000 people with disabilities had found work in the past couple of years.  Praising Mr Duncan Smith, with whom he is reported to have had a history of disagreements, he said: "I'm sorry that my right honourable friend chose to leave the government and let me here in this House recognise his achievements in helping to make work pay, protecting the vulnerable and breaking the decades old cycle of welfare dependency."  But he rejected his former colleague's charge that the chancellor's fiscal targets risked dividing society and working-age benefit claimants were being unduly penalised by a "desperate search" for savings.  "There is not some inherent conflict between delivering social justice and the savings required to deliver sound public finances," he said. "There are one and same thing. Without some public finances there is no social justice."  It was clear that the chancellor was opting for spiritual healing rather than keyhole surgery.  His departed colleague Iain Duncan Smith was praised for having helped to create a fairer society.  The chancellor even dared to reclaim the mantra the former work and pensions secretary questioned in his resignation letter - "we are all in this together" he promised.  It would set the tone for the chancellor's statement, which was more often about the big picture on the economy rather than the fiscal detail.  In his resignation letter, Mr Duncan Smith said targeting disability benefits at the same time as cutting corporation and capital gains taxes flew in the face of the prime minister's and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  Conservative MPs noisily backed Mr Osborne during the debate although former chancellor Ken Clarke noted Mr Osborne had ruled out rises in income tax, VAT and national insurance and urged him to consider asking better-off pensioners to give up free bus passes and winter fuel allowances.  In response, Mr Osborne said people who had worked hard all their lives deserved a "decent, generous basic state pension and I am not going to take that away".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described his opposite number as a "political chancer" while Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said Mr Osborne's reputation was tarnished and he risked damaging the campaign to keep the UK in the EU.  As well as the welfare changes, Downing Street said ministers would also not seek to oppose amendments to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" and an increase in VAT on solar panels.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35870894	Running into deep trouble	Meanwhile in the House of Lords...  The government's Housing and Planning Bill is running into deep trouble, with Labour's chief whip, Lord Bassam, promising anything between eight and a dozen significant defeats for ministers, when report stage consideration starts, after Easter.  If he can marshal a combination of Labour and Lib Dem peers, plus crossbenchers and Tory rebels, the bill could be gutted of some of its most controversial sections. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have become adept at getting key crossbenchers to lead the charge, so watch out, in particular for amendments in the name of Lord Kerslake, a former Permanent Secretary in the Department of Communities and Local Government, and housing expert Lord Best.  The big amendments may thud down onto the table at the end of this week, or perhaps during the second week of the Easter break - and may be countered, probably in the second week of that break, by government amendments, offering concessions to head off defeat.  Conservative sources say there is some wiggle room.  Unusually, Labour today published a shopping list of possible changes. They cover all the major elements of the bill: giving councils control over the numbers and tenure type of starter homes; requiring a "one built for one sold" rule, if social housing tenants are given the right to buy; adding safeguards on secure tenancies; imposing new duties on fitness for human habitation and electrical safety on landlords, and ensuring the proposed changes to the planning system don't give developers a free hand.  It's quite a list, but as Labour made clear today, they regard this bill as a target rich environment, in which a strong coalition of peers can be mobilised against many key provisions.  The battles will be fought out over a five day report stage, which is expected to start immediately after peers return from their Easter break - with the fifth and final day of report on Monday 25 April.  That puts the third reading in May, leaving limited time for prolonged parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons, and with the clock ticking toward the end of the Parliamentary session, the Lords will enjoy considerable leverage and ministers will face enormous pressure to make concessions, or risk losing their bill altogether.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35875210	Did George Osborne do enough to heal Tory wounds?	With open wounds in his party, a gap in his finances and questions over his competence the chancellor had much to try to heal.  He was returning to the chamber less than a week after announcing his Budget, with one of its measures already dead and others surviving only after life support.  Had George Osborne himself been left fatally weakened by Iain Duncan Smith's resignation?  Certainly his authority was in question.  Mr Osborne's critics wanted to know how he was going to fill a £4.4bn "black hole" left by the U-turn over disability payments.  Labour had pointed to another gap - left by a man they said was too "scared" to answer their urgent Commons question over all of this on Monday.  But now here he was at the dispatch box - a chancellor opening the final day of a Budget debate, something that he pointed out had not happened in 20 years.  As he got to his feet the body language from MPs behind him seemed positive; there was the sound of rousing support as he began to speak.  The mood in the chamber immediately calmed as the chancellor began by paying tribute to the victims of the tragic events in Belgium.  It was a reminder, said Mr Osborne, of "what a precious thing our democracy is".  Today's Budget debate was part of that democratic process, he said, before a nod of euphemism to the significant problems he had been having.  "I think it's fair to say that we've had a livelier debate about this Budget than many."  So what of his solutions? It was clear that the chancellor was opting for spiritual healing rather than keyhole surgery.  His departed colleague Mr Duncan Smith was praised for having helped to create a fairer society.  The chancellor even dared to reclaim the mantra the former work and pensions secretary questioned in his resignation letter - "we are all in this together" he promised.  It would set the tone for the chancellor's statement, which was more often about the big picture on the economy rather than the fiscal detail.  "Without sound public finances there is no social justice," he said.  The cost of the disability payments U-turn could be "absorbed", he declared.  But it was far from an answer for Labour MPs, who punctuated the chancellor's statement with critical interruptions.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Osborne's behaviour called into question his fitness for the office he holds.  "What we've seen is not the actions of a chancellor... but the grubby incompetent manipulations of a political chancer," he said.  Mr Osborne got what he predicted - a lively debate on the budget; healing the problems it leaves him may take some time longer.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35870296	Row over HIV prevention drug Prep	Charities say NHS England's "eleventh hour decision to pull the plug" on game-changing HIV prevention drugs is leaving people at risk.  The medication- known as Prep - has been shown in UK studies to reduce the chances of people getting HIV.  Charities claim they had expected it to start being rolled-out later this year.  But NHS England officials, who had been involved in early discussions about Prep, say providing it is not their responsibility.  Instead they say under health regulations, preventative medicine (rather than treatment) falls to individual local authorities to consider.  Meanwhile NHS England says it will offer £2m worth of funds to treat around 500 people over the next two years.  It says the money, which local authorities will be able to bid for, will help them consider the overall feasibility and cost-effectiveness of offering the drugs.  Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is intended for healthy people who are at high risk of getting HIV. This would include, for example, men who have sex with multiple male partners without using condoms.  The medicine is already available to certain groups in the US, France, Israel, Canada and Kenya.  And a recent trial by the UK's Medical Research Council and Public Health England showed that giving the drugs to healthy gay men at risk, led to an 86% fall in new infections.  Charities describe the approach as a game-changer and argue the decision by NHS England fails those who are vulnerable to HIV.  Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "For the last 18 months charities, academics and patients have been lulled into a false sense of security.  "Because NHS England has been involved in all the discussions, we had expected the drug to go to a public consultation and then be commissioned and rolled-out - with guidance - towards the end of the year.  "Pulling the plug on this process at the eleventh hour is leaving people at risk who would otherwise have been protected.  "And the bottom line is that 8 or 9 gay men are infected with HIV in the UK every day. We see people every day in clinic who we know could benefit from this.  "We know it works."  Prep has so-far been available to people enrolled in a research trial taking place in six cities in the UK, and can also be bought privately.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35869921	Conservatives propose overhaul of local party associations	The Conservatives have put forward plans to change the structure of local party associations and the way that election candidates are chosen.  The party wants to pilot associations spanning more than one constituency and also centralise certain membership functions and create a single candidate list for UK and European elections.  Chair Lord Feldman said it would help channel resources into campaigning.  It follows a review launched in the wake of last year's election victory.  Despite the Conservatives winning their first majority since 1992, there were concerns that it struggled to match Labour's "ground campaign" in many parts of the country, in terms of mobilising activists to canvass and help get out the vote.  The party is now proposing a series of changes to how voluntary parties are structured at a local level which it says will give it a "stronger platform" from which to fight the next election.  It wants to encourage some local associations, which vary considerably in size, to combine to form multi-constituency organisations in the hope of boosting their financial strength and improving their capabilities.  Party members in those areas will be asked to vote on the plans while associations with more than 100 members and a "fully operational structure" will be able to opt out if a majority of members vote against.  Other changes would see constituency associations offer different levels of membership, with associated benefits, and for administration of membership to be centralised - although parties will be still be responsible for recruiting members locally.  The review panel has recommended an outreach programme to widen the pool of candidates for future UK and European elections amid criticism the party remains too middle class and, despite recent progress, has too few female MPs and that ethnic minorities continue to be under-represented in the parliamentary party.  Lord Feldman, a close ally of David Cameron, said the changes - which must be approved by the party's National Convention at its autumn conference - showed the party was "far from complacent" despite last year's victory.  "To continue to win elections, with the buy-in and support of our members, we need to adapt," he said.  "Currently, our associations spend less than a third of their total income on campaigning - that's not the right allocation of resources if we are going to run a really dynamic operation on the ground."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35870399	Salt consumption down	Adults in England have cut their average salt consumption by nearly a gram in the last decade, but at 8g per day it is still above the recommended 6g for good health, figures reveal.  The data from Public Health England is based on measurements taken from a random sample of 689 adults.  Three quarters of the salt we eat is in foods we buy, and there has been a push for industry to cut salt levels.  High salt can raise blood pressure, which increases the risk of strokes.  Voluntary salt reduction targets were first set in 2006 for a range of food categories in the UK that contribute most to the population's salt intakes - for example crisps, butter and margarines, breakfast cereals and bread.  In 2014, fresh targets were set to include popular dishes consumed outside the home, such as sandwiches, ready meals and children's meals in fast food outlets.  Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: "While people are having less salt than 10 years ago, we are still eating a third more than we should.  "The majority of the salt we eat is in everyday foods so it's important to check labels and choose lower salt options. Many manufacturers and retailers have significantly reduced the salt levels in everyday foods. However, more needs to be done, especially by restaurants, cafes and takeaways."  When shopping for food, you can take steps to cut your salt intake:	health

The new national programme will be launched this spring, with the aim of helping 20,000 people this year.  Patients will be offered 13 sessions focusing on exercise, education and lifestyle changes.  GPs are being asked to identify the people who would benefit the most from the programme.  This will be done through blood-glucose testing and monitoring for signs of pre-diabetes.  While type-1 diabetes cannot be prevented and is not linked to lifestyle, type-2 often is.  The programme will be available in 27 areas, covering half the country, to start with and involve support such as supervised gym sessions.  The rest of England will follow by 2020, when there will be 100,000 places available.  There are currently 2.6 million people with type-2 diabetes in England, with 200,000 new diagnoses every year.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme would reduce hospital admissions, prevent strokes and the complications of diabetes, such as amputations.  "By offering targeted support for at-risk individuals, the NHS is now playing its part in the wider campaign against obesity, which is already costing the country more than we spend on the police and fire service combined," he said.  Diabetes UK chief executive Chris Askew said the programme should prove significant for many people at risk of diabetes.  "This will provide them with the best possible chance of reducing their risk of developing diabetes and living a long full healthier life," he said.  The cost of the programme is £7m this year - but that is being set against the £10bn annual spend on diabetes care.  Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie added: "Type-2 diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges of our time."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35868006	No more welfare cuts, for now	"I'm absolutely flummoxed", one minister confessed. Everyone believes the same things they did this time last week, they explained, so why has so much changed?  A cabinet minister has resigned, Conservatives have spent much of the last couple of days taking lumps out of each other in public, and the government has, to use the awful but-oh-so-handy jargon, carried out a screaming U-turn on its Budget.  Late this afternoon, the new secretary of state for work and pensions Stephen Crabb then appeared to promise a new policy altogether - not just ditching the planned changes to Personal Independence Payments that have caused so much trouble, but a commitment from the government not to carry out any further raids on the welfare budget. In other words, a promise of no more benefit cuts, for now.  Mr Crabb provided the usual Westminster wriggle room - no "planned" extra cuts - rather than ruling out taking the axe to the benefits budget ever, ever again.  But couple that with his comments in the Commons - "behind every statistic is a human being and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that" - and it seems the new secretary of state was displaying just as much sympathy with his predecessor's views as with the chancellor or the prime minister.  I'm told the plan to make that announcement was Mr Crabb's but the language was agreed by Downing Street and Number 11. The irony was perhaps that Iain Duncan Smith was nowhere to be seen in Westminster, absent for the announcement he might have longed to make himself  It seems his successor at least has some sympathy with IDS's view that the cuts to welfare have gone far enough.  P.S. It's worth remembering of course that the government has already set in train £12bn of cuts to welfare - very significant cuts, too.  P.P.S. It's also worth noting that David Cameron gave his backing very publicly to George Osborne today. Tomorrow, the chancellor has to front up this mess in the Commons himself.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35863776	Stephen Crabb: 'No further plans' for welfare cuts	Ministers have said say they will not target other benefits to pay for abandoning cuts to disability payments.  Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb made the pledge in his first speech since replacing Iain Duncan Smith, who quit as discord broke out in the Tory party over the cuts.  Earlier, the PM defended Chancellor George Osborne, whose Budget is missing £4.4bn since the cuts were dropped.  Labour said Mr Osborne should resign and the Budget should be withdrawn.  Both David Cameron and Mr Crabb praised Mr Duncan Smith, who has said the government risked dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts.  The new work and pensions secretary confirmed the changes to Personal Independence Payments had been cancelled and told MPs: "After discussing this issue over the weekend with the prime minister and the chancellor we have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by Parliament two weeks ago."  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government could technically bring forward cuts at a later date but politically this now looked very difficult.  A Downing Street spokesman said the government would still deliver on its commitment to save £12bn from welfare by the end of the Parliament in 2020.  Mr Crabb also said the government welfare cap, branded "arbitrary" by Mr Duncan Smith, had "strengthened accountability" and its level would be reviewed in the Autumn Statement later this year.  "I am absolutely clear that a compassionate and fair welfare system should not be just about the numbers," he added.  "Behind every statistic there is a human being, and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that."  The Conservative leadership has been under fire - including from some of its own backbenchers - over the cuts to disability payments, which came at the same time as tax cuts for higher earners.  Mr Duncan Smith - who resigned on Friday - said this flew in the face of Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  London mayor Boris Johnson welcomed the fact that the cuts had been shelved but he said he rejected "totally and utterly" claims that the government was pursuing divisive policies.  Speaking to ITV's The Agenda, he said Mr Duncan Smith should have "stayed and fought his point of view" from within cabinet, saying his walkout was "a storm in a teacup".  Mr Cameron addressed Mr Duncan Smith's attack during a statement about the European Council in the Commons on Monday afternoon.  He stressed to MPs that the Conservatives remained a "modern, compassionate, one nation" party under his leadership.  He listed policies aimed at low-earners including the National Living Wage and rebuilding "sink estates", adding: "None of this would be possible if it wasn't for the actions of this government and the work of the chancellor in turning our economy around."  The changes to Personal Independence Payments which prompted his resignation have now been shelved, and ministers plan to say how the planned £4bn savings will be found at the Autumn Statement later in the year.  Responding to Mr Cameron's statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber and said the U-turn on disability benefits had created an "enormous hole" in the Budget, adding that the package had "inequality at its core".  He did not mention Mr Duncan Smith's resignation or his parting shot at the government.  When Labour MP Liz Kendall did put Mr Duncan Smith's criticism to the PM, Mr Cameron said he was sad at his colleague's resignation, adding: "But I can guarantee that work of being a compassionate Conservative government will continue."  The changes to the Budget were the subject of an urgent question from Labour before Mr Cameron's statement.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Mr Osborne to resign following Mr Duncan Smith's resignation and the furore over the PIP cuts, but Downing Street says the chancellor has the full confidence of the prime minister.  Mr McDonnell said Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber "insults this House" and that Treasury Minister David Gauke had been left to "defend the indefensible".  He added: "This is no way to deliver a Budget and no way to manage an economy."  Mr Gauke said the chancellor would be in the chamber for Tuesday's Budget debate, and said Labour was not in a position to comment on "black holes" in budgets.  He said spending on Personal Independence Payments was up by £3bn since 2010, adding that the Budget "closes the gap between rich and poor and North and South".  As well as the welfare changes, Downing Street says ministers will not seek to oppose amendments to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" and an increase in VAT on solar panels.	politics

An amendment to the Immigration Bill to let the children come to Britain was adopted by 306 votes to 204 - a majority of 102.  Labour's Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child refugee, said it would save children from exploitation and abuse.  But the government said the amendment would not target those most in need.  Home Office minister Lord Bates said the government was concentrating its efforts on helping Syrian refugees before they reach Europe and insisted no other country was doing more than the UK.  Campaigners, including charity Save the Children, have been calling for the government to accept 3,000 children from Europe into the UK, but ministers have warned that it could spur more refugees to risk "lethal" journeys.  Ministers may seek to overturn the defeat - the latest in a string of votes the government has lost in the Lords this Parliament - when the bill returns to the Commons.  Arguing for the UK to take in 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees, Lord Dubs said it would protect children from exploitation, people trafficking and abuse.  The peer - who arrived in the UK as a refugee on the Kindertransport which helped children escape from the Nazis during World War Two - said the UK needed to show the same compassion.  "I would like other children who are in a desperate situation to be offered safety in this country and be given the same opportunities that I had," he told peers.  His amendment - which would require ministers to allow the children to come to the UK as soon as possible after the bill became law - attracted cross-party support.  "We could do it in 1930s, why can't we do it now?" said crossbench peer Baroness Neuberger, while fellow crossbencher Lord Alton of Liverpool warned that refusing to help the children would leave a "lasting stain" on Britain's reputation.  "This is a small, but beautiful thing that we can do," added the Bishop of Chelmsford, the Rt Rev Stephen Cottrell.  Meanwhile, a call to exclude children above the age of 12 from the scheme came from former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson of Blaby.  Home Office minister Lord Bates said on behalf of the government: "We have a principled objection. That the people most at risk are in the region."  "I question whether it (the amendment) identifies, or provides help, for the right people. We believe we should not be doing anything that encourages one child to make that perilous journey," he added.  Lord Bates said 51% of the 1,000 Syrian refugees resettled in the UK - as part of the government's pledge to take in 20,000 by 2020 - had been children.  He also said there was a shortage of foster carers and that it was hard to place refugee families with local authorities.  But the government's argument was not supported by the majority of the House, which voted by a margin of 102 to accept the amendment.	politics

It comes after Labour peer Lord Levy threatened to quit the party unless Mr Corbyn sent a "clear message" that it would not allow anti-Semitism.  Mr Corbyn said he had always condemned all forms of racism and any complaints of anti-Semitism in the party would be properly investigated.  Labour has been hit by several claims of anti-Semitism recently.  Last week, party member Vicki Kirby was suspended for a second time over anti-Semitic tweets. A Labour spokeswoman said Ms Kirby, vice chair of the Woking constituency party, was being investigated.  Allegations relating to Oxford University Labour Club are also being investigated.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: "The idea that somehow or other there is a tolerance of any form of racism is wholly and totally fallacious."  He said he was "disappointed" at the comments made by Lord Levy, who on Sunday said "it is now up to the leadership to make sure that there is a clear and unequivocal message out there that anti-Semitism in any form will not be tolerated".  Lord Levy had said: "If they don't make that clear then I will start to question myself and actually question my being a Labour peer and a proud member of the Labour party."  But Mr Corbyn said the peer "clearly hasn't been listening to the seven times since I became leader I have absolutely condemned anti-Semitism, I have condemned Islamophobia, I have condemned any form of racism anywhere within our society".  "It is absolutely something I totally, passionately believe in," he added and said his views were understood throughout the party.  The Labour leader added: "We do take action in the very, very, very small number of cases where anything happens and if we hear any allegations they are properly and thoroughly investigated."  Ms Kirby was first suspended in 2014 for making anti-Semitic comments but later reinstated. She was forced to stand down as an election candidate after tweets including one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God".  The Parliamentary Labour Party is also carrying out an investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in the Oxford University Labour Club after it voted to support Israel Apartheid Week.  Oxford University Labour Club has said previously in a statement: "We are horrified at and whole-heartedly condemn anti-Semitic behaviour in all its forms."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35860525	Labour claims 'tampon tax' victory amid Tory rebellion	Ministers have said they will not oppose calls to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" when the issue comes to a vote in the House of Commons.  The government was facing a rebellion from Eurosceptic MPs over the 5% VAT rate on women's sanitary products.  It is at the lowest rate allowed by EU law but rebels unhappy with EU say over tax rates were set to join forces with Labour to insist on VAT being removed.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was "another Labour victory" on the Budget.  The government has also conceded ground over the issue of VAT on solar panels and other domestic energy saving and insulation products, amid a threatened Conservative rebellion over a potential tax rise.  VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products - but more than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  In Wednesday's Budget, Mr Osborne said he recognised public feelings about the issue and said the EU had agreed to give the UK the leeway under EU law to set a zero rate.  Hailing what he said was a tax concession from Brussels that "no British government has even tried to achieve", he pledged to spend the proceeds of the tax on women's charities.  The government has now confirmed it will not oppose a Labour amendment to the Finance Bill calling for a zero rate of VAT. A number of Conservative MPs had threatened to vote with Labour on Tuesday to highlight the role of Brussels in setting VAT rates.  Some of those say they still intend to do so, arguing they think implementation of the reduced VAT rate will be delayed while all other 27 EU countries agree to the changes.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who tabled the amendment, welcomed the news. She tweeted: "Wow, thank you. Happy being the MP for Dewsbury." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as "another Labour victory".  At last week's European Council summit in Brussels, the 28 leaders agreed a statement welcoming "the intention of the Commission to include proposals for increased flexibility for member states with respect to reduced rates of VAT, which will provide the option to member states of VAT zero-rating sanitary products".  The European Commission has said it is working on two options that would allow member states more flexibility over setting VAT rates and will set out proposals on Wednesday.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35846848	Government backs down in face of Tory 'solar tax' rebellion	Downing Street has said it will not resist attempts by Tory Eurosceptics to block a rise in VAT on solar panels after it faced potential defeat.  Tory rebels angry at EU influence over UK tax rates were set to join forces with Labour to stop any rise in the 5% rate on home insulation and renewables.  Ministers have also conceded ground in another EU-related tax row.  The government said it will not block a separate amendment calling for a 0% VAT rate for women's sanitary products.  In the wake of Wednesday's Budget, UK officials said EU leaders had agreed a deal to allow the UK to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", the 5% VAT rate on women's sanitary products.  The UK is seeking more flexibility over VAT rates currently set at an EU level. The European Commission is set to publish proposals on Wednesday on giving member states more leeway over VAT rates.  But about a dozen Tory Eurosceptics were still planning to side with Labour by backing amendments to the Finance Bill demanding action on the twin tax issues - which are in the spotlight ahead of June's EU referendum.  Eurosceptics have been persistent critics of rules in force since the early 1990s harmonising VAT rates across the EU, arguing they undermine national sovereignty and the right of member states to set their own tax rates.  The UK and other EU members cannot levy sales tax at less than the standard 15% rate except on specified items. For these approved products and services, countries have the scope to charge VAT at a reduced rate of no less than 5%.  The UK has long applied a 5% rate to the installation of domestic energy-saving products for anyone over the age of 60 who is unemployed, disabled or claiming benefits such as income support or housing benefit.  But the current 5% rate was ruled illegal by the European Court of Justice in June. The Court said it was a breach of EU laws as the products and services concerned did not fall within the VAT directive which only exempts the "provision, construction, renovation and alteration of housing as part of social policy" and the "renovation and repairing of private dwellings".  Labour had warned VAT could rise to at least 15% as early as August unless the chancellor takes immediate action and that such a move would cost thousands of jobs in the renewables sector.  The opposition, which supports EU membership but has been critical of cuts to solar and renewable subsidies, has tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill "empowering" George Osborne to set a zero rates on insulation and renewable materials or, alternatively, to compensate the industry for the financial impact that any VAT rise would have on jobs and investment.  Labour's amendment, expected to come to a vote on Tuesday, had won the support of a dozen Tories who are unhappy about EU control over UK tax rates and seeking to highlight the issue in the run-up to June's EU referendum.  Those backing it include former ministers Tim Loughton and Peter Lilley and Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives - all of whom want the UK to leave the EU.  If it fails to abide by the ECJ's ruling, the UK could face infringement proceedings and potential financial penalties.  But Mr Brady told the BBC News Channel the question at issue was whether the UK "decided its own tax policy or not".  "I think it is really important that just because we have had these welcome concessions, it does not make us forget we are in a position where we have to seek permission from other governments of other countries to allow us to make these changes even if the majority of people in our Parliament want those changes in tax policy."  With a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons, the government faced defeat if the SNP and the Lib Dems had also supported the opposition amendment.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35861447	What is the row around PIPs all about?	At the heart of the row between the now former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith and his government are PIPs - Personal Independence Payments.  But why have they become so controversial?  PIPs are benefit payments made to help people aged 16 to 64 cope with the extra costs they face due to ill health or disability. Not means-tested, they are gradually replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA).  Nearly 700,000 people currently claim PIP, with another 1.5 million still to be reassessed.  DLA was based entirely on self-assessment, whereas eligibility for PIP depends on a test carried out by Atos or Capita on behalf of the government. Money is allocated according to a points system and eligibility is kept under regular review.  The criteria for PIP were already stricter than DLA - for example, in the past someone was considered to be "virtually unable to walk", and therefore eligible, if they could not walk more than about 50 metres. Under PIP, that was dropped to 20 metres, excluding, at the government's estimate, more than 420,000 people.  Ministers wanted to make the criteria stricter still and that desire is at the crux of the current row.  There are two components - daily living and mobility - and eligibility is based on ability to carry out 12 activities, including eating and drinking, washing, going to the toilet, communicating and getting around.  The more severe someone's needs the more they will receive - up to a maximum of £139.75 a week.  The money can be spent on a wide range of things. The mobility element often goes towards specially adapted cars, scooters or wheelchairs, paid for via the Motability scheme. The daily living element can cover anything from a prosthesis to specially designed utensils, hand rails and toilet seats.  The plan was to reduce the weighting given to two of the 10 criteria for the daily living element - dressing and managing toilet needs. So, instead of someone who needs grab rails to use the toilet receiving two points, they would have only received one.  That single point difference could have meant an individual getting less money, or losing PIP altogether if it put them below the points threshold for qualifying.  An independent review carried out for the Department for Work and Pensions found that "a significant number of people are likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal to no ongoing daily living extra costs".  The department says it reviewed a "number of cases" and in 96% of them the "likely ongoing extra costs of daily living were nil, low or minimal" - for example, because many of the aids and appliances which people are currently getting points for are provided free by the NHS and councils, or could be bought cheaply.  Number 10 also says the cost of PIPs is rising by around a billion pounds a year and needs to be brought under control.  Yes. In his first Budget in 2010, George Osborne made reforming DLA a priority.  Four years later, in October 2014, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that spending on disability benefits between 2015 and 2019 would total £55.9bn. By March 2016, that figure had risen to £66.4bn.  The switch to PIP was designed to save money - something sources close to Mr Duncan Smith are continuing to insist it will ultimately do - but things are not as simple as that.  Those same sources have told the BBC the problems are "to do with people transferring to PIP from DLA. They are sicker than the DLA system said they were."  The OBR said the rising costs were because of higher-than-expected caseloads - and people getting more money than ministers had predicted. The average payout is now £100 a week, 14% higher than expected.  Costs have also risen because claimants are being increasingly successful in appealing against officials' decisions, often helped by charities.  Not everyone would have lost out, and those who did would have only lost cash as and when their conditions were reassessed.  However, charities said up to 640,000 people would be affected by 2020, each standing to lose up to £100 a week.  Labour said the changes would have removed the ability of many people to live independently.  And of course, the loudest critic of all has been Mr Duncan Smith, who said the decision to "juxtapose" the changes with tax cuts for the better off in the Budget was the final straw.  For its part, the government says making the criteria stricter would have saved £1.2bn a year and made the system "fairer". More broadly, it puts the changes in the context of the planned introduction of Universal Credit - the new single monthly payment of benefits and tax credits due for roll-out from 2017 - under which it says some people will be better off.  The proposals have been shelved.  However, the government said just a few days before the Budget that it wanted to save a further £4.4bn from the UK welfare bill. Asked how the chancellor would cover the shortfall created by not going ahead with the PIP changes, Downing Street suggested the issue would be looked at in the Autumn Statement.  Number 10 has, though, stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is "unsustainable."  More broadly, there is the political fall-out. What damage has been done to George Osborne and indeed, David Cameron, and the impact Mr Duncan Smith's resignation will have on the EU referendum campaign, all remain to be seen.	politics

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence now agrees that abiraterone is affordable.  It had previously said the treatment was not cost-effective for the NHS until cancers were more advanced.  The drug costs £3,000 a month, but a lower price has been agreed with the manufacturer Janssen.  Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, is a hormone therapy, and unlike chemotherapy which kills the cancerous cells, it stops more testosterone from reaching the prostate gland and thereby stifles the tumour.  It is already used at the end-of-life after chemotherapy as it can give patients an extra few months.  But NICE had previously said it could not justify giving the drug to patients with earlier stage disease, even though such patients in Scotland did have access to it.  Instead, patients in England had to rely on their doctors applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund, a special pot set aside for cancer drugs not routinely available on the NHS.  Now NICE says new evidence submitted by Janssen means it can offer the drug to more patients - those with spreading prostate cancer who have only mild symptoms and who have not responded to androgen deprivation therapy and have not yet been offered chemotherapy.  It is estimated that 5,900 people with this category of prostate cancer might be eligible each year in England.  Prof Carole Longson, from NICE, said: "There are few treatments available for patients at this stage of prostate cancer so this is very good news."  Heather Blake, from Prostate Cancer UK, said: "This long awaited decision is fantastic news and brings an end to years of uncertainty for men and their loved ones. After 18 months our calls have finally been heard as NICE and the manufacturer have managed to negotiate a way forward. However it cannot continue to take so ludicrously long to get men what they need.  "If the newly reformed drug appraisal process really is to work better for men, manufacturers must present best value for money first time around while greater flexibility from NICE must come as standard. We need to see much more focus on what patients need and deserve, otherwise men will men will lose out as they continue to be caught in the middle."  The NHS in Wales is expected to provide funding and resources for abiraterone within three months of the English guidance being published.  The new price for the drug on the NHS in England is £2,300 for 120 tablets, which is 30 days' supply.  Under the agreed discount, the NHS pays for the first 10 months of treatment with abiraterone. For people who remain on treatment for more than 10 months, Janssen will rebate the drug cost of abiraterone from the 11th month until the end of treatment.	health

That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time.  Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer.  It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand.  They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum.  If it does come that soon there will be, one predicts, a "genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites".  A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak.  A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam.  Cameron and Osborne's decade long effort to present their leadership as an exercise in compassionate politics is under direct threat.  One backbencher, Sarah Wollaston, went on the Today programme to demand a signal Osborne was willing to rethink his Budget, and suggest that manifesto guarantees to protect pensioners could be dropped.  And there is a coalition at work - opposition parties, Eurosceptic and centrist Tory backbenchers - that can overturn the government's thin majority and stop it delivering manifesto commitments.  They are eyeing two possible votes on Tuesday night, both demanding Britain should be able to set VAT rates free of EU influence, as a chance to flex their muscles.  As political advisor, MP, precociously young shadow chancellor and minister, Osborne has fought and won more scraps than most.  If some of his allies need him more than they love him, his network spreads far and wide.  Crucially, Number 10 are not about to restage the Blair era battles between PM and Chancellor.  So he will fight, but many more concessions to his critics could cost his dearly.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35833128	Are the Scottish and EU referendums similar?	Is the referendum on Britain's EU membership turning into a re-run of Scotland's independence vote?  Many of the arguments have a familiar ring to them - but there are some crucial differences and, perhaps, lessons to be learned.  Scots were warned of the risks of leaving the UK in 2014. The UK government claimed "going it alone would be costly", suggesting homeowners could face higher mortgage payments and ruling out a currency union.  Now, voters are being told of the potential economic consequences of leaving the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron has said: "A vote to leave is the gamble of the century. And it would be our children's futures on the table if we were to roll the dice."  Campaigners in favour of Scottish independence and those who back leaving the EU have been accused of understating the risks of change.  In both debates the risks of the status-quo were also highlighted. In the Scottish campaign, pro-independence activists said the NHS would be under threat if the union continued, while pro-Brexit campaigners warn of security threats staying the in the EU and a worsening migration crisis.  During Scotland's debate, some business leaders wrote open letters urging Scotland to remain in the UK. That's happened against with the EU debate, with bosses of companies including BT, Marks & Spencer and Vodafone signing a letter saying an EU exit would deter investment in the UK.  Lloyds Banking Group said during the Scottish campaign that it would relocate to London if Scotland chose independence. Standard Life also threatened to move.  This time, HSBC has warned it will move jobs to France.  Speaking months before Scotland went to the polls in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the US wanted to retain a "strong, robust, united and effective partner" in the United Kingdom.  The Spanish prime minister fired a warning at Scotland, saying it would have to negotiate its way into the EU if it left the UK (though he had a vested interest, given independence movements in Spain).  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed that he wanted to see a "united" United Kingdom.  This time the EU has a vested interest in the UK staying. A number of leaders from the bloc have said they want the UK to stay.  President Obama has previously said the UK must stay in the EU to continue to have influence on the world stage and will visit the UK soon (pro-leave figures have warned him against an intervention).  The term "project fear" was coined by a staffer from the pro-UK Better Together campaign during the independence vote.  Then Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond urged Scots to embrace the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no". Project Fear became a byword for negative campaigning from the pro-union side.  And the exact same term has already become one of the key phrases of the EU debate. Boris Johnson has slammed "the agents of project fear", while a spokesman for Leave EU told me "project fear" was all the UK government had to offer.  The prime minister has said he believes he is presenting "project fact". Downing Street has also sought to portray some of the the PM's speeches as focussing on the positive economic advantages of EU membership.  Just days before Scotland voted on its future in the UK, The Queen said she hoped "people will think very carefully about the future" to a well-wisher outside church near her Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.  The comment came after reports suggested she was worried about the vote. Royal officials insisted her comment did not breach the monarch's constitutional impartiality.  Buckingham Palace has again insisted the Queen is "politically neutral" over the EU referendum, following a claim in the Sun that she "backs Brexit".  The newspaper quoted sources, one of whom claims to have witnessed a "bust-up" between the Queen and pro-EU former Deputy PM Nick Clegg in 2011, where the monarch is said to have told Mr Clegg the EU was "heading in the wrong direction".  Labour MP Kate Hoey, who is co-chair of the Labour Leave campaign, says negative campaigning turns people off referendums. And she can see parallels with the Scottish "fear factor".  "There's no doubt about it, that there was this fear factor up there, again being pushed by the prime minister and the chancellor," she says.  She adds the leave campaign will look to "build on what happened in Scotland".  Robert Oxley, head of press for Leave.EU, says his side has been looking at the lessons of the Scottish vote.  "The lessons are that you do have to have a positive vision," he says. "You do have to engage people on the ground, you have to be prepared for last minute government interventions - and not necessarily playing by the rules."  Alex Salmond was the figurehead of the pro-independence 'Yes' campaign.  He agrees with Leave campaigners that people are put off by negative campaigning. But he says both sides are guilty of it this time around.  "In the Scottish referendum campaign one side was presenting hope and the vision of a better future, which is ultimately the thing that mobilises people," he says.  "When you have two fear-ridden campaign at the end of the day they fight to a no score draw".  No. The UK government says its campaign is positive and argues it is pointing out the benefits of staying in a reform EU, as well as the potential dangers of leaving it.  Michael Fallon, the Scotland-born defence secretary, says the campaign this time will be "slightly different".  There was more emotion in the Scottish debate, he adds, but this is more about where is Britain strongest and best off.  "It will be based more, I hope, on the facts," he says.	politics

He attacked the "desperate search for savings" focused on benefit payments to people who "don't vote for us".  And he told the BBC's Andrew Marr his "painful" decision was "not personal" against Chancellor George Osborne.  Downing Street said it was sorry to see Iain Duncan Smith go but was determined to help "everyone in our society".  BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said Mr Duncan Smith's interview - which followed his resignation over cuts to disability benefits on Friday - was an "absolutely blistering attack".  He added: "This was not just about his objections to one change in disability benefit, he was questioning the fundamental principles underpinning the government."  Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC he had supported a consultation on the changes to Personal Independence Payments but had come under "massive pressure" to deliver the savings ahead of last week's Budget.  The way the cuts were presented in the Budget had been "deeply unfair", he said, because they were "juxtaposed" with tax cuts for the wealthy.  He criticised the "arbitrary" decision to lower the welfare cap after the general election and suggested the government was in danger of losing "the balance of the generations", expressing his "deep concern" at a "very narrow attack on working-age benefits" while also protecting pensioner benefits.  If the focus on the working-age benefit budget continued, he said, "it just looks like we see this as a pot of money, that it doesn't matter because they don't vote for us".  Mr Duncan Smith, who said he felt he had become "semi-detached" from government, said the Conservatives had to return to being a party "that cares about even those who do not vote for us".  He said he cared "passionately" about "people who don't get the choices my children get" and "bringing people back in to an arena where we play daily but they do not".  He suggested the government was in "danger of drifting in a direction that divides society rather than unites it, and that, I think, is unfair".  In his interview, Mr Duncan Smith gave his version of a deteriorating relationship with the government, saying he had considered resigning last year and had "long-running" concerns about cuts imposed since May's general election.  He said the disability benefit cuts should have been part of a "much wider programme" - but after Christmas "pressure began to grow" to rush a consultation so they could feature in Wednesday's Budget.  Asked why he had not spoken out when the measures were presented to cabinet, he said he "sat silently" as he "realised the full state of what was happening" with tax cuts featuring elsewhere in the Budget.  After thinking "long and hard", he said he agreed to write to MPs to reassure them over the disability cuts, saying "it's not what it sounds like in the Budget".  But he said he realised in the following two days "there was no way I would able to stop this process" and resigned on Friday evening.  What pushes a cabinet minister to resign so sensationally?  Its origins lie partly in the rapid shift of the economic gloom-o-meter. Forecasts in December's Autumn Statement were upbeat, predicting more money rolling into the Treasury.  By Wednesday's Budget, the sunshine had turned into "storm clouds". They blew over Iain Duncan-Smith's department because welfare changes of recent years have so far brought in nothing like the savings originally projected.  IDS signed off on tightening the rules around Personal Independence Payments five days before the Budget, but now says he would rather have been allowed to wait so he could see who were the winners and losers.  As the row gathered momentum after the Budget, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggested the plans weren't set in stone.  Mr Duncan Smith's people disagreed, firmly believing the proposals were final. The following day, Downing Street suggested a U-turn was on the cards.  For IDS, it was the final straw, believing he was going to carry the can for a policy he claims he'd been bounced into prematurely. Others question his account - asking why he signed off the proposal in the first place if he was so against it.  Mr Duncan Smith spoke of his "love" for the Conservative Party and described claims he was trying to undermine David Cameron as "nonsense", saying he had had a "robust" conversation with the PM after telling him of his resignation.  Asked whether Mr Osborne would make a good prime minister, he added: "If he was to stand and if he was elected by the electorate, which is not just me it is everybody else, I would hope that he would."  A Number 10 spokesman said: "We are sorry to see Iain Duncan Smith go, but we are a 'one nation' government determined to continue helping everyone in our society have more security and opportunity, including the most disadvantaged.  "That means we will deliver our manifesto commitments to make the welfare system fairer, cut taxes and ensure we have a stable economy by controlling welfare spending and living within our means."  He said more people were in work under this government with fewer "trapped" on unemployment benefits.  Former Lib Dem minister David Laws told Andrew Marr divisions between Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith over welfare had been a "running sore throughout the last parliament".  He said: "George Osborne, I think it's fair to say, did regard the welfare budget as something of a cash cow to be squeezed in order to help to deliver deficit reduction. Iain Duncan Smith had a different view."  Mr Duncan Smith's resignation has divided his former ministerial team at the DWP.  Pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann attacked his tenure, describing him as "exceptionally difficult" to work for, and accused him of using his resignation "to do maximum damage to the party leadership" in order to support the campaign to leave the EU.  But her fellow DWP minister Shailesh Vara said he was "surprised" at Baroness Altmann's comments, saying: "Ros's recollection does not accord with mine and I'm sorry that this has all happened."  Disabilities minister Justin Tomlinson said the former secretary of state had "always conducted himself in a professional, dedicated and determined manner", while employment minister Priti Patel told BBC Radio 5 live it had been a "privilege" to work for him.  Owen Smith, Labour's welfare spokesman, said Mr Duncan Smith had been "very honest in explaining how George Osborne could have taken different choices" and had revealed "the fundamental unfairness at the heart of government policy".

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35854735	Duncan Smith resignation 'was about EU'	Iain Duncan Smith's resignation was really about the EU, pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann has said.  On Friday, Mr Duncan Smith said he was quitting as work and pensions secretary in protest at disability benefits cuts.  But Lady Altmann, who described her ex-boss as "exceptionally difficult" to work for, accused him of wanting "to do maximum damage to the party leadership" to help his campaign to leave the EU.  Sources close to Mr Duncan Smith insist his resignation was not about the EU.  Meanwhile, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind has told the BBC he finds Iain Duncan Smith's behaviour "bizarre".  He said it was "difficult to believe that someone committed to welfare issues would resign on them",  Mr Duncan Smith is due to give his first interview since resigning on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show at 09:00 GMT. Stephen Crabb was appointed as Mr Duncan Smith's replacement on Saturday.  In his resignation letter, which many commentators have interpreted as an attack on Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Duncan Smith said the latest changes to benefits for the disabled were "not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers".  But Lady Altmann said she was "shocked" by the resignation saying her former boss had "championed the very package of reforms to disability benefits he now says is the reason he has resigned".  In a statement, Lady Altmann said: "This really seems to be about the European referendum campaign.  "He seems to want to do maximum damage to the party leadership in order to further his campaign to try to get Britain to leave the EU.  "As far as I could tell, he appeared to spend much of the last few months plotting over Europe and against the leadership of the party and it seemed to me he had been planning to find a reason to resign for a long time."  She also said she had found him "exceptionally difficult" to work for and said he had "often been obstructive to my efforts to resolve important pension policy issues".  Former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said that Mr Duncan Smith "quite clearly knew" before the chancellor's statement how his department would be affected.  He should have made it clear he wanted to resign before the budget was announced, Mr Rifkind said.  But another of Mr Duncan Smith's junior ministers, employment minister Priti Patel, praised Mr Duncan Smith as a "great social reformer".  "Since coming to office in 2010, he has made a real difference to the life chances of people throughout the country by reforming the welfare system to ensure that work always pays," she said.  And Justice Secretary Michael Gove, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, called Mr Duncan Smith "an inspirational social reformer" who has been "guided throughout by a clear sense of noble moral purpose".  However, Mr Gove, who like Ms Patel and Mr Duncan Smith, is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, wrote that a "united and resolute government" was needed.  He wrote that he also "hugely" admired Mr Osborne and said that "I can't - and won't - take issue with either of them in the areas they've championed and led".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on the disability budget but changes to benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn on this by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), due to replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn a year, but sparked an outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs.  But on Friday, before Mr Duncan Smith resigned, a government source had said the planned changes would be "kicked into the long grass".  Replying to Mr Duncan Smith on Friday, David Cameron said he was "puzzled and disappointed" that Mr Duncan Smith had decided to go when they had agreed to have a rethink about the policies.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35851269	Who is Stephen Crabb?	Appointed amid the furore of Iain Duncan Smith's explosive resignation, Stephen Crabb has already been tipped to make the headlines in his own right.  The 43-year-old former Welsh secretary, raised by his mother on a council estate in Haverfordwest, has a back story that contrasts sharply with that of many of his cabinet colleagues.  He has spoken in interviews of the "horrible decisions about what food and clothing was affordable" as he was growing up.  Many see his personal story as well suited to his new role at the Department for Work and Pensions, where he will take on the reforms championed by Mr Duncan Smith and fiercely opposed by some charities and opposition MPs.  In an interview with BBC Wales Westminster correspondent David Cornock last month, the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire described how the welfare system had provided a "genuine safety net at a time of crisis" for his family.  "I had a mother who, as we got older, moved progressively from a position of complete welfare dependency to being fully economically independent, working full-time," he said.  "And that has to be the model of the way the welfare system should work."  Mr Crabb says his first political memory is the 1979 general election that brought Margaret Thatcher to power, and that witnessing her flagship right-to-buy policy on his street had a "huge impact" on him growing up.  After attending Tasker Milward school in Haverfordwest, he studied at Bristol University, gaining a first-class degree in politics, joining the Conservative Party after graduating.  He won his seat at the second attempt in 2005, and worked as a whip before becoming a minister in the Wales Office, where he was appointed secretary of state in July 2014.  Mr Crabb, who is married with two children, lives near Haverfordwest and is a keen rugby player.  He is the first Conservative cabinet minister for a century to have a beard - and David Cameron recently jokingly suggested he could be the next James Bond after comparing him to Hollywood star Russell Crowe.  It's not the only role the new work and pensions secretary - who unlike Mr Duncan Smith supports the UK remaining in the European Union - has been tipped for.  He is well thought-of in Conservative circles - and with David Cameron to stand down as party leader before the next election, some think he could be in line for a bigger promotion.  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson recently told the Daily Telegraph she would "find it very hard to vote for anyone else" if he was involved in a leadership contest, while the influential Conservative Home website says his promotion will boost his leadership prospects.  "His political convictions were not forged on the playing fields of Eton and his summer job was working on a building site," WalesOnline's political editor David Williamson wrote last week, in an article asking whether Mr Crabb could be the man to unite the Tories after the EU referendum.  Asked about leadership ambitions by the BBC's David Cornock, Mr Crabb said: "I don't think I have an ambition to become leader, really.  "It doesn't feel that long ago in my life that the thought of becoming an MP seemed outlandish and unrealistic, so to find myself a few years ahead sitting at the cabinet table doing a job for Wales, I just feel incredibly blessed with that really."  He went on to say he would fancy "a shot at doing something UK-wide" in the future.  On the morning of his appointment, he tweeted about his "busy Saturday" including an advice surgery in Haverfordwest followed by Wales versus Italy in the Six Nations rugby.  With his sudden elevation into one of the most high-profile jobs in cabinet, it has just got even busier.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35850200	Iain Duncan Smith quits: David Cameron 'puzzled' by resignation	David Cameron says he is "puzzled and disappointed" after Iain Duncan Smith quit as work and pensions secretary.  Mr Duncan Smith said the latest planned cuts to disability benefits were "not defensible" in a Budget that benefited higher-earning taxpayers.  In response, Mr Cameron said they had "collectively agreed" on the proposals, before deciding on Friday to have a rethink to "get these policies right".  Stephen Crabb has been named as Mr Duncan Smith's replacement.  Before he was ousted as Conservative leader in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith was dubbed "the quiet man". But there was nothing subdued or understated about the manner of his departure last night.  Instead, a zinger of a resignation letter, designed to inflict maximum damage on Chancellor George Osborne; a relationship that had long been testy, tested to destruction by this week's Budget.  By questioning, as the Conservatives' critics have long done, the Tory slogan to justify cuts - "We are all in this together" - Mr Duncan Smith knowingly provided the government's opponents with ammunition.  For a man with ambitions to lead his party, these have been difficult days for George Osborne.  This morning David Cameron woke to a vacancy in his cabinet and a wound inflicted on his government.  In his Budget on Wednesday, Chancellor George Osborne had said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability but changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn a year and sparked outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs.  On Friday, prior to Mr Duncan Smith's resignation, a government source said the planned changes would be "kicked into the long grass".  Baroness Stroud, who worked with Mr Duncan Smith in government and now heads the Centre for Social Justice think tank, which he founded, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Iain came into government... in order to deliver a social justice agenda, a reform agenda of the welfare state.  "He always used to say to me, 'I'm here in order to deliver reform and to protect the poorest'.  "Yesterday he felt that he could no longer protect the poorest... This is a step too far."  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Today he was also "disappointed" by Mr Duncan Smith's resignation but the welfare reform programme would "go on".  Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said: "Behind this is a much, much bigger drama of which Iain was the driver... What he crucially cared about was the balance of resources going to families and children and older people.  "The pensioner element, the biggest part of the Budget, was safeguarded and in fact increased.  "And therefore all these cuts were on people of working age and it's this point that Iain thinks the social contract between generations is being broken."  In his reply to Mr Duncan Smith's resignation letter, Mr Cameron said there had been collective agreement that "the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most".  "That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago," he said.  "Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  "In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign."  Mr Cameron's letter also highlighted that they were "on different sides in the vital debate about the future of Britain's relations with Europe".  Sources close to Mr Duncan Smith, who wants the UK to leave the EU, say his resignation was not about Europe.  In his resignation letter, Mr Duncan Smith said that "because of the perilous public finances we inherited from the last Labour administration, difficult cuts have been necessary".  "I have found some of these cuts easier to justify than others but aware of the economic situation and determined to be a team player I have accepted their necessity.  "You are aware that I believe the cuts would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners but I have attempted to work within the constraints that you and the chancellor set."  But he went on: "I have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are a compromise too far.  "While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers."  He added: "I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said: "Tensions with the chancellor had been simmering for some time, but there was little warning of Friday's explosion.  "What seemed to be at its core were briefings by government sources which placed responsibility for the controversial changes to PIP firmly at Mr Duncan Smith's door, while he had in fact felt some pressure from the Treasury to deliver them."  Mr Duncan Smith was Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003, and had been work and pensions secretary since the 2010 general election.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron have both called for Mr Osborne to resign.  Mr Corbyn said: "The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith reveals a government in disarray and a chancellor who has lost the credibility to manage the economy in the interests of the majority of our people."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35850542	Conservatives 'dangerously divided' as Duncan Smith quits	It's not just Iain Duncan Smith who's angry.  Senior ministers are "absolutely furious" about his resignation and departure from government.  Some ministers believe the claims in his letter are "just not true because he is well aware that the welfare changes have always clearly been about saving money as well as improving the systems".  It's suggested that his central motivation is the EU referendum, and, for others who are supporting him, a strategy to kill off George Osborne's hope of taking over from David Cameron.  IDS's team is adamant that his exit is entirely about the handling of PIPs (Personal Independence Payments) and nothing to do with the EU.  Whatever the truth, it is very dangerous for a political party to be so publicly divided, and, on a very simple level, for its members to be so angry with each other.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35846352	Mental health – “We must have change”	Conferences of the great and the good in areas like science, health and politics take place at Oxbridge colleges most weeks of the year. But this one was like few others.  Conceived and organised by the father of an 18-year-old who had taken his own life barely a year earlier, this one-day gathering offered a broad and challenging view of the state of mental health care of young people in England.  It revealed a widely shared view that notwithstanding the recent publication of NHS England's Mental Health Taskforce report, there is a lack of drive and joined-up thinking in government and the health service.  Steve Mallen has already shared his grief and anger at the loss of his son. A talented straight A-grade student, Edward was set to go to Cambridge University. But in a matter of weeks he succumbed to depression and took his own life.  His father, who argued that Edward had been failed by the system despite seeking help, wrote a strongly worded letter to the prime minister calling for a formal review of teenage mental health.  Steve Mallen set up a campaigning charity The MindEd Trust soon after Edward's death in February 2015 and the conference held at a Cambridge college was part of his drive to establish the nature of problems with the system and seek solutions.  He managed to get key representatives from the major political parties, officials from the main NHS organisations, academics and mental health campaigners into the same conference hall, which was no mean achievement.  Mr Mallen told the audience that parity of esteem between physical and mental health were "empty words". Highlighting financial data, he said that only 10% of the NHS budget was spent on mental health and of that, only 0.7% on the children's and adolescent area.  Mental health literacy across society was "shocking", he said, and he felt he was standing next to his son on behalf of his generation and made a plea to the assembled experts: "We must have change."  Norman Lamb, for the Liberal Democrats, argued that there was nothing the government could do which was more important than dealing with the "awful neglect" of mental health. Labour's Luciana Berger, via a recorded video, paid tribute to Steve Mallen and said there was a journey which had to be continued.  Francesca Reed of the Youth Select Committee, an initiative supported by the House of Commons, called for more work in schools. She said training for lunchtime supervisors as well as staff was required to enable them to help pupils who needed it.  Rosie Tressler of Student Minds noted that there was stigma associated with students with mental health challenges, including even at medical schools.  The minister with responsibility for mental health, Alistair Burt, told the conference that when he had been given the job by David Cameron he had been told to "move things on" beyond the work done under the coalition.  He said every clinical commissioning group had been told to come up with robust local plans on how money was being spent on children's and adolescent mental health services.  Mr Burt received some animated questions from the floor.  The Departments of Health and Education, it was claimed, did not work together effectively on mental health in schools. Educational pressures, including tests, were blamed for creating unnecessary stress for children. The minister said he had regular meetings on the subject with his counterpart at Education.  It was just one of many gatherings focussing on mental health. But this conference organised by one campaigner, bringing together politicians, civil servants from different parts of Whitehall, charities and those with personal and family experiences of mental illness, was unusual.  It illustrated the continuing frustration about the financing and profile of mental health care. We will certainly hear more from Steve Mallen.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687	Iain Duncan Smith quits over planned disability benefit changes	Iain Duncan Smith has resigned as work and pensions secretary, denouncing £4bn of planned cuts to disability benefits as "indefensible".  He complains of pressure to "salami slice" welfare, saying the latest cuts were a "compromise too far" in a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers.  David Cameron said he was "puzzled and disappointed" at the resignation.  Earlier, the government had indicated it would look again at some of the proposed disability benefits changes.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: "There had been bad blood off and on between Chancellor George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith over some of the more controversial welfare reforms, but nobody expected this move only 48 hours since the Budget."  She added that she understood Mr Cameron had personally tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to stay on and called the resignation "a bombshell at a very sensitive time".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne had said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability but changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn and sparked outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs. A government source said on Friday they would be "kicked into the long grass".  Mr Duncan Smith, who was the Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003, wrote in his resignation letter that the changes to disability benefits were "defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit".  But he said they should have formed part of "a wider process" of finding the best way to focus resources on those most in need.  "I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self-imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest," Mr Duncan Smith said.  "Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a Budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working-age benefit bill.  "There has been too much emphasis on money-saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.  "It is therefore with enormous regret that I have decided to resign."  He wrote that he believed the cuts "would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners".  In his reply to Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Cameron said they had all agreed that "the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most".  "That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago," he said.  "Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  "In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign."  A source close to Iain Duncan Smith told me his resignation is "because of their behaviour. This is not about Europe"  Iain Duncan Smith is understood to have told them that the government "can't keep taking money from the working poor."  He was concerned that his "narrative for welfare reforms was in danger of being thrown away." He felt he had no choice but to act because welfare reforms "matter more than anything".  Over the weekend Iain Duncan Smith discovered the Chancellor planned to offer cuts in Capital Gains Tax and was very unhappy that those tax cuts were to be offered to the better off, while he had been forced to make more welfare cuts prematurely, in his view. When Number 10 and the Treasury then backtracked on the reforms to PIP today, he concluded that he could no longer remain in government.  Sources close to him are absolutely adamant that his decision was in no way related to his views on Europe.  Mr Duncan Smith was praised by Tory MP and fellow Out campaigner in the EU referendum Peter Bone as a "man of principle" who had taken the job because he "passionately believed in social justice".  And Tory Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Mr Duncan Smith had been "as important a welfare secretary as I can think of".  "I think it is deeply concerning that a man of the stature and standing of Iain Duncan Smith should be pushed into this position," he added  However, opposition parties welcomed Mr Duncan Smith's resignation and called for Mr Osborne to resign as well.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith reveals a government in disarray and a chancellor who has lost the credibility to manage the economy in the interests of the majority of our people.  "The chancellor has failed the British people. He should follow the honourable course taken by Iain Duncan Smith and resign."  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter: "IDS resignation may be more about EU than his conscience - but he has struck a fatal blow to #PIP cuts and that's a good thing."  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: "It is quite right that Iain Duncan Smith has resigned over this heartless plan to cut disability benefits, but the true mastermind of the changes, George Osborne, should also be considering his position."	politics

Here is the full text:  Thank you for your letter this evening.  We are all very proud of the welfare reforms which this government has delivered over the last six years, and in which you have played an important part.  As a government, we have done a huge amount to get people into work, reduce unemployment and promote social justice. There are now more people in work than ever before in our country's history, with 2.4 million more jobs created since 2010.  I regret that you have chosen to step down from the government at this moment. Together we designed the Personal Independence Payment to support the most vulnerable and to give disabled people more independence.  We all agreed that the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most.  That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago.  Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign.  You leave the government with my thanks and best wishes.  While we are on different sides in the vital debate about the future of Britain's relations with Europe, the government will, of course, continue with its policy of welfare reform, matched by our commitment to social justice, to improving the life chances of the most disadvantaged people in our country, and to ensuring that those who most need help and protection continue to receive it.	politics

The following year at the party's conference, he said: "The quiet man is here to stay and he's turning up the volume."  As it turned out, he didn't last that much longer as leader, but in the years that followed he bounced back to become a respected and influential figure in the party and the government.  Whatever you think of his welfare reforms, there is no arguing with their ambition, or with his passion and dedication to the brief as seen from his resignation letter to the prime minister.  Yes, there must already have been tensions, given that he was one of the handful of cabinet ministers to declare they were campaigning for the UK to leave the EU in the forthcoming referendum, against the side favoured by David Cameron.  But his resignation, at the culmination of a 48-hour post-Budget row about plans to cut back the amount being planned to be spent on a disability benefit, still came as a bolt from the blue at Westminster.  But who is Iain Duncan Smith? Here is a look at his background, written by Mary Ann Sieghart for BBC Radio 4's Profile programme in 2010.  At the 2010 Conservative Party conference, Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, was introduced as a round peg in a round hole. The man who was a failure as party leader had at last found his niche.  His department accounted for about a third of public spending, and welfare reform was at the heart of the government's plans to tackle the deficit and balance the books.  He had not only reinvented himself, but had won the admiration of his party.  It was Iain Duncan Smith, or IDS as he is widely called, who was credited with moving the Conservative Party back to the centre ground on poverty and public services.  This was not what you might have expected from a pin-striped former Guards officer on the right of his party.  So what sort of man is he?  The Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who was his campaign manager when he became leader in 2001, points out that IDS is "not emotionally available. For someone who is so closely associated with compassion he is personally very old-fashioned you might say".  But IDS can be funny. He is a talented mimic and - as befits the youngest of five children - is happy to be teased.  But he does sometimes rub people up the wrong way.  Mr Duncan Smith, now 61, had a very stable childhood with an old-fashioned and Christian upbringing.  His father was a highly-decorated fighter pilot who downed 19 enemy planes during World War Two. His mother was a ballerina and his great-grandmother was Japanese, from Samurai stock.  His most formative memory is of watching his much-admired father with tears streaming down his face at Winston Churchill's funeral. He had never seen his father cry before.  At 14, Mr Duncan Smith was sent to HMS Conway, a boarding school on Anglesey for boys aiming to join the Navy.  Clive Plummer was a schoolmate and remembers that: "We didn't have any cleaners, so brushing parade decks, cleaning classrooms and dorms were all managed by the cadets. So in managing teams, you would make sure that not only were the most able utilised but also the less gifted.  The young Iain was not particularly academic, but he was very sporty. He won the national schools' triple jump and came second in javelin.  He later joined the Army and went to Sandhurst, but not university. Michael Mitchell met him while he was serving in Germany and says that he was not like your average Guards officer. He read widely, wrote poetry and painted.  He was also mischievous.  "He was best man at my wedding in Belgium," Mr Mitchell said.  "At Belgian weddings the bride, groom and parents have to stand in a line and receive guests for two, three hours, and I had a call of nature and asked Iain to stand in my place. And when people asked: where's Michael? He'd say - 'ooh, the last time I saw him he was walking down the road with his suitcase', or he'd say: 'Madam, are you sure you're at the right wedding?' Typical Iain - wanting to inject fun into something."  But no-one then thought he had political ambitions.  IDS left the Army against his father's wishes after just six years, and joined the defence company GEC-Marconi. His Conservative Party biography claimed he was a director, which was not correct. And his own biographical notes said he studied for a degree at Perugia University, when he only did a language course in that city.  In 1982, he married Betsy, daughter of Lord Cottesloe. They have four children.  IDS entered the Commons in 1992, in Norman Tebbit's old seat of Chingford and Woodford Green.  As a Eurosceptic, he rebelled over the infamous Maastricht treaty, knowingly risking his chance to get a promotion to government. He told his former press secretary Nick Wood: "I'll fight for what I believe and if I don't get a job - so be it."  The then Prime Minister John Major never did give IDS a job, but when William Hague became party leader he appointed the Maastricht rebel to shadow defence and then social security.  It was a surprise to everyone when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2001. It was perhaps even more of a surprise that he won, having reached the run-off by only one vote.  He defeated the runner-up, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, only because he was more sceptical on Europe.  He really was the accidental leader. Tim Montgomerie, who went on to run the Tory activist website, ConservativeHome.com, wrote speeches for him and eventually became his chief of staff. He says that, as leader, IDS was "completely unprepared. He had no staff, no infrastructure, no worked-out agenda".  Mr Duncan Smith knew that the Tories had to shake off the image of being the so-called "nasty" party. His response was to shift the focus towards public services - like health and education - and tackling poverty.  A formative experience was a trip to the sink estate of Easterhouse in Glasgow.  Mr Montgomerie remembers that "on that cold grey day when he visited Easterhouse and was taken round by a Baptist minister, and stopped in a stairwell where he saw paraphernalia of drug abuse next to a child's teddy - something came together.  "Something suddenly clicked," Mr Montgomerie adds. "He realised here was his personal mission and a mission for the Tory party."  His problem though, was that he was struggling to connect with the political establishment.  He did try, such as when he told the Tory conference in 2002: "There are those who do not know me yet, who will come to understand this. When I say a thing I mean it. When I set myself a task I do it. When I settle on a course I stick with it. Do not underestimate the determination of the quiet man."  Labelling himself "quiet" was not considered a masterstroke in political rhetoric.  Stuart Wheeler, then one of the Tory party's biggest donors, threatened publicly to withdraw his funding unless IDS went.  "As leader I think he was a disaster," he said.  "He lacked gravitas and came over as weak. He was a bad communicator. One read that he was high-handed with his staff and that his office was shambolic. He'd lose important papers down the back of sofas."  In the end, Mr Duncan Smith's own MPs forced him out through a vote of no confidence.  Enoch Powell once said that all political careers end in failure, but for Duncan Smith, failure came in the middle of his career instead.  For after losing the leadership, he decided to devote himself to improving the lot of the poor.  He set up the Centre for Social Justice, whose work became the cornerstone of Conservative policy on welfare reform, and which he himself is now putting into practice in government. It has already caused controversy, with opponents claiming the poor will be hardest hit by the government's spending cuts.  But it remains his belief that the best way to alleviate poverty is to get people off benefits and into work. By all accounts it was a huge surprise to him to get the call offering him the Work and Pensions Secretary job after the 2010 election.  There has always been a sense of tension between his department and the Treasury - he had to win a bruising battle with the Treasury right at the start to get the go ahead for universal credit.  The on-going effort to introduce Universal Credit has been a constant while he's been in his job. His resignation cites the "enormous strides" made but suggests that those tensions with the Treasury have been more heated than thought.	politics

The work and pensions secretary resigned from the Cabinet over planned cuts to benefits.  In his resignation letter, he said he was "proud of the welfare reforms that the government has delivered over the last five years" but added: "the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are, a compromise too far. While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848891	In full: Iain Duncan Smith resignation letter	Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has resigned, citing pressure to make cuts to disability benefits. Here is the full text of his letter:  "I am incredibly proud of the welfare reforms that the government has delivered over the last five years. Those reforms have helped to generate record rates of employment and in particular a substantial reduction in workless households.  As you know, the advancement of social justice was my driving reason for becoming part of your ministerial team and I continue to be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve. You have appointed good colleagues to my department who I have enjoyed working with. It has been a particular privilege to work with with excellent civil servants and the outstanding Lord Freud and other ministers including my present team, throughout all of my time at the Department of Work and Pensions.  I truly believe that we have made changes that will greatly improve the life chances of the most disadvantaged people in this country and increase their opportunities to thrive. A nation's commitment to the least advantaged should include the provision of a generous safety-net but it should also include incentive structures and practical assistance programmes to help them live independently of the state. Together, we've made enormous strides towards building a system of social security that gets the balance right between state help and self help.  Throughout these years, because of the perilous public finances we inherited from the last Labour administration, difficult cuts have been necessary. I have found some of these cuts easier to justify than others but aware of the economic situation and determined to be a team player I have accepted their necessity.  You are aware that I believe the cuts would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners but I have attempted to work within the constraints that you and the chancellor set.  I have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are, a compromise too far. While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers. They should have instead been part of a wider process to engage others in finding the best way to better focus resources on those most in need.  I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest.  Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working age benefit bill. There has been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.  It is therefore with enormous regret that I have decided to resign. You should be very proud of what this government has done on deficit reduction, corporate competitiveness, education reforms and devolution of power. I hope as the government goes forward you can look again, however, at the balance of the cuts you have insisted upon and wonder if enough has been done to ensure "we are all in this together".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35847611	Ministers 'to rethink' disability cuts	Planned changes to disability benefits will be "kicked into the long grass", according to a government source.  Chancellor George Osborne faced criticism over the cuts announced last week, which were likely to affect some 640,000 people.  The changes had been expected to shave £1.3bn a year off the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) bill.  "We need to take time and get reforms right and that will mean looking again at these proposals," the source said.  "We are not wedded to specific sums - it is about making sure that what will be an increasing amount of money goes to those who need it most."  The latest change applies to the formula the government uses to calculate the daily living component of PIP, which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and come into effect in January 2017.  Mr Osborne has insisted the "most vulnerable" will still be protected.  The chancellor said earlier that the overall disability budget was "going up" and that ministers would be talking to colleagues and disability charities to "make sure we get this absolutely right".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said that the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability.  However, changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35847161	Week ahead	Last Wednesday's Budget Day cheers have faded, and the Chancellor faces triple trouble as the four day debate on his eighth Budget ends on Tuesday.  When the Budget resolutions are voted on, there are two amendments: both of which could well attract that rare combination of Labour, SNP, minor party and dissident Tory support that is needed to overturn the government majority.  There's a cross-party amendment calling for VAT on women's sanitary products to be zero-rated, which looks likely to be pressed even though the government believes it has secured EU agreement to allow this to happen.  Then there's a Labour amendment, signed by at least a dozen Conservatives, which would, in effect, reject a European Court of Justice ruling requiring Britain to increase VAT on home insulation and energy saving products from 5% to 20%.  There's quite a cocktail of motives behind the two amendments - feminist and green arguments, to be sure; but also an anti-EU point about control of taxes in the UK, mixed in with some gleeful manoeuvring in the undeclared race to succeed David Cameron.  The third Budget-related issue is the government proposal to change the rules on Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) - the benefit which has replaced Disability Living Allowance.  A number of Tory backbenchers including David Burrowes, the architect of the recent government defeat on Sunday Trading, have been expressing concern about the impact on vulnerable people.  This measure won't be in the forthcoming Finance Bill, and the government has now promised consultation and hinted at compromise, after a nervy couple of days which saw a rather undignified blame game played out between the Treasury and the Department of Work and Pensions, and an increasingly irritated Downing Street.  Expect Labour gloating and semi-public negotiation between ministers and Conservative backbenchers, as the Budget debate unfolds. And note that the other implication of this not being a Finance Bill measure is that it could therefore run into trouble in the Lords, (who're not able to touch finance measures) as well as the Commons.  And speaking of their Lordships' House, the government has been having a pretty rough ride there; but after some fairly gruelling sessions on the Housing and Planning Bill - including a till-they-drop committee stage day which went on until nearly midnight, it looks as if the bill is back on track and should enter report stage immediately after the Easter break, just about keeping the show on the road.  The government will be reasonably well placed to deal with outstanding differences between the Lords and Commons on its remaining legislation without too much panic or pressure, before the end of the session.  But having suffered a bruising week, with six government defeats (two on the Immigration Bill, three on the Trade Union Bill and one on a move to regret the early closing of the Renewables Obligation to small solar photovoltaic installations) ministers can't contemplate their next few weeks in the Upper House with great confidence. The majorities against the government on the Trade Union Bill varied between 88 and 148 votes, which will certainly embolden the Opposition to keep resisting.  Here's my rundown of the parliamentary week ahead:  The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions, followed by the continuation of the Budget debate.  In Westminster Hall (at 4.30pm), MPs will debate E-petition 121262 on the NHS's contract negotiations with the BMA - which has attracted 118,455 signatures. The petition accuses the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, of imposing new contracts on junior doctors, "in his endeavour to destroy the NHS and privatise healthcare in the UK".  The Government response says there will be no imposition and that the aim is to introduce a fairer, safer contract, which they can do for new staff and as contracts expire as juniors move through training.  In the Lords, (2.30pm) after their usual half hour of questions to ministers, peers will deal with no fewer than three bills - a sign that the scheduling has become a little frayed.  First up is the third reading of the Scotland Bill. Normally these are quite brief exercises in rubber stamping, but there is talk of a last ditch amendment on the rather arcane issue of the "Sewell Convention" under which the UK and Scottish Parliaments pass legislative consent motions to avoid treading on each other's toes.  This is followed by the Immigration Bill, report stage, day two. Key issues will be Lord Dubs' amendment on unaccompanied refugee children, family reunion for asylum seekers, genocide and the immigration skills charge (likely to be in relation to universities and the health sector).  Finally, there will be be some further consideration of the Housing and Planning Bill including "permission in principle".  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Health questions. Then, Labour MP Wes Streeting has a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Taxi and Private Hire Vehicle Operators (Regulation) - this aims to increase training requirements for those seeking a PHV (private hire vehicle) licence, to improve safety and ensure a more level playing field between training requirements for drivers of taxis and PHVs; to switch to an "operators insurance" system where PHV companies are responsible for insuring their drivers rather than drivers individually, and to ensure multinational operators pay full taxes on money earned in the UK by closing legal 'loopholes' which enable profits to be transferred to another country.  When that is dealt with, the House moves onto the conclusion of the Budget debate - and the Budget resolutions (see above).  The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Jake Berry is on government policy to prevent breast ironing in the UK - this is painful form of ritual body mutilation, which involves pounding and massaging the developing breasts of young girls with objects that have been heated over coals.  In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the importation of faulty electrical goods (9.30am-11am); the first anniversary of war in Yemen (11am- 11.30am); GPS satellite navigation and heavy goods vehicles (2.30pm-4pm); the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities under Daesh (4pm-4.30pm) and the Macur Review into historic child abuse - from Liz Saville Roberts (4.30pm-5.30pm).  In the Lords (at 2.30pm) peers grind on through the Housing and Planning Bill committee stage (day eight of nine) where the main issue in play will be the privatisation of the preparation of planning applications.  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Scottish questions, and at noon there is Prime Minister's Questions.  That's followed by an interesting Ten Minute Rule Bill on Cannabis (Legalisation and Regulation) from Norman Lamb, The Lib Dem former health minister believes that there is a strong public health case for regulating (and taxing) the trade rather than allowing organised crime to sell what may be very dangerous forms of cannabis.  The day's main legislating is on the HS2 Bill - aka the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Bill. This is the report stage, after a gruelling two-year committee stage, in which people affected by the controversial mega-project have petitioned MPs for more compensation, changes to the route and environmental protections.  There's an amendment down from the Conservative Michael Fabricant, whose Litchfield constituency is along the route of the new line, to kill the whole bill. It is highly unlikely to be selected, and Mr Fabricant would not push it to a vote if it was (defeat would be certain given the scheme has Conservative and Labour support) but it puts his objections on the record.  Arch HS2 opponent Cheryl Gillan has a series of amendments on everything from compensation to tree planting - but her key proposal is for an adjudicator to deal with complaints during the construction process. Once approved by MPs, the bill goes to the Lords.  Next, there's a motion on "Short Money" - the funding given to opposition parties to support their parliamentary work, which pays for assorted researcher/spin doctor figures. The government had proposed major cuts, to the fury of the Opposition parties and seems to be backing rapidly down - not least because it infuriates potential Commons allies, who might be needed when their narrow majority is in danger. Expect some quiet crowing when the retreat is sounded.  There's also a slot pencilled in for consideration of any Lords amendments to bills - and after the recent defeats on the Immigration Bill and the Trade Union Bill there will have to be quite a few of bouts of "Parliamentary ping-pong" with their Lordships, in the coming weeks.  The adjournment debate, from Labour's Stephen Hepburn, is on the prosecution of construction companies for fatal accidents.  In Westminster Hall, there are debates on: the political situation in Burma (9.30am -11am); legal guardianship and missing people (11am- 11.30am); enforcement of the national minimum wage in the care sector (2.30pm- 4pm); the registration of births of children of deceased people (4pm- 4.30pm), and Hong Kong and the Sino-British Joint Declaration (4.30pm- 5.30pm).  In the Lords (3pm) there's yet more committee stage debate on the Housing and Planning Bill - but this should be the final day, allowing the bill to move to report stage after Easter.  And peers will also debate two statutory instruments on the Greater Manchester Authority and on the Tees Valley Combined Authority; after which peers rise for their Easter break.  In the Commons (9.30am) MPs open with Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling.  The rest of the day is dedicated to backbench business - first a debate on court closures - and then the debate on the Easter adjournment, in which MPs can speak about any subject that takes their fancy.  The adjournment debate is followed by an adjournment debate - in this case, former Army officer Johnny Mercer on the role of charities in the veterans' care sector.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35840917	Row erupts over Labour's defence 'underspend' claim	A war of words has erupted after Labour questioned whether the government would meet its target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.  Labour said it had discovered an £800m dip in spending in Budget papers.  But a defence minister said Labour had got its sums wrong - overall spending had not gone down but money had moved from one part of its budget to another.  Labour has written to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon to seek assurances he is committed to Nato's spending target.  Shadow defence minister Toby Perkins asked about the effect of the apparent cut to spending "on our already stretched ability to respond to demands that our government places on our armed forces".  But Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Procurement, said: "Labour have made two fundamental errors.  "Firstly, they have used the figures from the March 2015 Budget instead of the July 2015 Budget that followed the election. Secondly, they failed to include capital spending.  "The defence budget in the July 2015 Budget was £34.9bn and latest estimates are higher than that at £35.2bn.  "Thankfully, when they get the numbers wrong now, it doesn't cause the damage it did when they ran the country."  Labour stuck to its claim that the government was spending less on defence than a year ago.  Mr Perkins said: "Even if you combine the capital and current spending projections of the Budget 2016 and compare them with the next most recent budget, given at the Autumn Statement, there is still a shortfall of £200m.  "The government claim it is an 'underspend', but it is clear that this is actually the new normality that Britain's armed forces will be forced to deal with over the next few years."  The UK is currently one of only five Nato members, along with the US, Estonia, Greece and Poland, to meet the alliance's budget target - which recommends that a minimum 2% of a country's GDP be spent on defence.  Before last year's general election, David Cameron would not be drawn on whether the UK would continue to meet the target in the next few years given the scale of the public spending cuts earmarked to eliminate the deficit.  But in his July Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would meet the Nato pledge on a "properly measured" basis and said overall spending on defence would be ring-fenced, getting a real terms 0.5% annual increase in its budget every year until 2020.  US President Barack Obama was reported to have warned Mr Cameron that the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35843592	Osborne under pressure from Tory MPs over disability benefit cuts	Pressure is mounting on George Osborne to rethink £4bn in cuts to disability benefits as a growing number of Tories express concerns about their impact.  Up to 640,000 people could have support for aids and appliances used for daily tasks either scaled back or removed.  One MP said Personal Independence Payments (PIP) were a "lifeline" while a minister said the policy was a "self-inflicted presentational problem".  George Osborne has insisted the "most vulnerable" will still be protected.  The chancellor said the overall disability budget "is going up" and ministers would be talking to colleagues and disability charities to "make sure we get this absolutely right".  Labour said the cuts in support, announced last week and included in the Budget, were "shameful" and they would be forcing a vote in the House of Commons as soon as possible.  The government's slender majority means they could block the plans with the support of Tory rebels and the SNP, which is also against the changes to Personal Independence Payments.  Independent peer Baroness Meacher, who led last year's opposition in the Lords to proposed tax credit cuts, told the BBC there would be "tremendous support" among her colleagues to overturn the policy.  And the Liberal Democrats, who have more than 100 peers in the Lords, said they would seek to "axe" the plans if they were approved by MPs.  Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said the government was in "disarray" over the policy.  "Hundreds of thousands of disabled people are worried sick at the prospect of having their PIP support cut and the Tory government are only making matters worse with their spin, confusion and lies."  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan - who said on the BBC's Question Time that the PIP cuts were just a "suggestion" at this stage - has been slapped down by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.  A source close to Mr Duncan Smith told BBC News the government was not in "concession territory".  They added: "I don't know how Nicky is explaining what she said, but she doesn't quite seem to have understood what Iain has been saying."  Quizzed about what she had meant with her Question Time comments, on a visit to Loughborough University, Ms Morgan said: "This is very much a matter for Number 10 and for the government press office and I'm not going to add anything to what I said last night."  The government wants to change the way the daily living component of Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) is calculated from January 2017.  This will see a re-evaluation of how new claimants and existing claimants who circumstances change or who are reassessed qualify for support for activities such as dressing, undressing and going to the toilet.  Government documents have indicated the change would save the government £1.3bn a year by 2020-21. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said it could result in claimants losing an average of £3,500 a year.  The government has faced intense criticism over the plans, with MPs warning they have not been properly explained and that it was mistake for Mr Osborne to announce them at the same time as Budget tax cuts for businesses and middle earners.  Johnny Mercer, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, said PIP was a "lifeline" for many of the most vulnerable people in society and urged ministers to proceed with care.  "I am concerned in terms of how we communicate this properly," he told the BBC's Daily Politics.  "In dealing with the most vulnerable groups in society, we need to be very, very careful and we need to work a lot harder to communicate what we are doing to these groups."  What are the proposed changes?  Recipients of PIPs are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive. Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.  The money is meant to help people cope with the extra cost of living with a disability or long-term health problem and are used to fund everything from mobility cars to adapted baths and showers.  The weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  It follows an independent review, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, which said a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having "minimal-to-no" ongoing daily living extra costs.  But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  The former soldier said ministers must explain their purpose was to eliminate "abuse and duplication" and reassure people the separate mobility element of PIP would not be affected.  "There have been veterans' charities ringing my phone ever since this came out and talking about this policy. I absolutely get that but we have to be careful about projections and what it actually means."  Former minister Dan Poulter said he had "serious concerns" while Sarah Wollaston said it was "entirely wrong" to be cutting benefits at the same time as reducing tax for middle-earners  One minister told the BBC that the way the policy had been presented to the public was flawed.  "A number of colleagues are starting to wonder if George Osborne as Chancellor has lost his touch," he said. "This is a self- inflicted presentational problem".  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled".  "The announcement made by the chancellor is a reverse of the whole trend of the past three decades, to go back to saying disabled people can't lead independent lives, can't get the support they need."  He added: "Any of us could become disabled at any time. We're just a car accident away from a major disability. We should think about that."  Disability Rights UK said thousands of people would be left "institutionalised" in their own homes if the rules were changed.  Mr Osborne rejected claims disabled people were bearing the brunt of further austerity measures, insisting the overall amount spent on disability benefits was going up.  "As Iain Duncan Smith has said, we are going to make sure that it goes to those who need our help most. So in the coming months we will be talking to colleagues, to disability charities, to make sure we get this absolutely right."  Are you currently receiving disability benefits?

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan described the plan as a "suggestion" and said it was "under consultation".  But sources close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said her comments don't "tally with what we and Downing Street are saying".

Speaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Ms Morgan said that the government was "continuing the conversation" to make sure money was "going to the right people to help them with the right needs".  "First of all we've got to finish the consultation and the conversations that we're having with MPs, but also with disability groups and others, before we even bring any legislation forward.  "It is something that has been put forward, there has been a review, there has been a suggestion, we are not ready to bring the legislation forward," she said.  Fellow panel members responded with incredulity to Ms Morgan's comments, with UKIP's Roger Helmer asking: "The Budget is merely a suggestion, is it?"  And sources close to Mr Duncan Smith also played down the significance of her comments. "Listening to the Education Secretary you might have assumed we are in concession territory," the source said, adding "that doesn't tally with what we and Downing Street are saying".  They added: "I don't know how Nicky is explaining what she said, but she doesn't quite seem to have understood what Iain has been saying."  Recipients of PIPs are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive. Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.  The money is meant to help people cope with the extra cost of living with a disability or long-term health problem and are used to fund everything from mobility cars to adapted baths and showers.  The weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  It follows an independent review, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, which said a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having "minimal-to-no" ongoing daily living extra costs.  But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  Downing Street said it would be bringing forward "legislative proposals" and, in the meantime, would continue discussions with MPs and campaigners.  Asked whether the education secretary had spoken out of turn, the PM's spokesman said she was making the point there would be dialogue but insisted the government's position has not changed.  There have been growing calls within the Conservative Party for a U-turn, with some MPs unhappy that the cuts are coinciding with plans to help middle and higher-earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% income tax to £45,000.  Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the Commons health select committee, said the only changes she wanted to see to disability benefits was a "refocus on those in greatest need". She tweeted: "Govt will never meet approval for change that wld reduce entitlement to #PIP at the same time as raising higher rate tax threshold".  Backbench Conservative MP David Burrowes said the proposals were a "backward step" and urged ministers to "press 'pause' on it" while Andrew Percy suggested they were more about helping the chancellor meet his self-imposed cap on overall welfare spending than reforming the benefits system.  The changes will need to be approved by both the House of Commons, where the government has a majority of 12, and House of Lords, where it has no working majority. The government was forced to abandon planned cuts to tax credits last year after they were voted down in the House of Lords.  An independent review of PIP in 2014 recommended major changes to the way it was delivered to improve how claimants are assessed and treated.  Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, has defended the changes, saying there would still be an increase in the number of people claiming PIPs and that the government would be spending more on disability benefits in 2020 than it does now.  He told the BBC that although hundreds of thousands of people would be hit by the cut, many of those would not lose out completely and would still be eligible for other forms of support.  "A significant chunk of that 640,000 will continue to receive the benefit," he said.  Are you currently receiving disability benefits? What are your thoughts on the planned reforms?

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35840916	Government rejects minister's call to tax coffee cups	The government has slapped down a suggestion by a minister that coffee shop cups could be taxed to prevent millions of them being thrown away.  Rory Stewart told MPs there was a "huge" problem with unrecyclable, plastic-lined paper cups.  He said the plastic bag tax had been a success and a cup tax was a "very good thing to look at next".  But Mr Stewart's department Defra immediately released a statement there were "no plans" for such a tax.  Campaigners say that disposable coffee cups handed out in their billions are "virtually impossible" to recycle despite major cafe chains claiming theirs are eco-friendly.  According to some estimates, fewer than 1% of the 2.5 billion paper and plastic cups used in the UK each year are recycled, leading to criticism of High Street cafes for stamping them with recycling logos.  Answering a Commons question from Labour MP Rob Marris, Environment Minister Rory Stewart said: "It's a huge problem and there are tens of millions of these things being produced and thrown away.  "As you have pointed out, many of these things cannot be recycled either by the way they're disposed or because of the composition of the cup.  "Having tackled plastic bags, which I hope everybody in the House would agree the plastic bag tax has been a success, coffee cups seem to be a very good thing to look at next."  In October, England became the last of the UK's nations to bring in a 5p charge on plastic bags, aimed at reducing litter and environmental damage caused by retailers handing out billions of single-use carrier bags.  A Defra spokesman said: "While the minister acknowledged more needs to be done to recycle coffee cups, there are no plans to tax them."  Disposable coffee cups can be difficult to recycle because most are made with a combination of paper and plastic.  There are just two specialist facilities in the UK that have the equipment to separate the materials.  Some coffee shop chains say they work to make recycling their cups easier and offer incentive schemes to encourage consumers to use their own.  A Starbucks spokesman said: "We are working closely with industry partners to crack the difficult problem of cup recycling.  "To incentivise environmentally friendly behaviour we offer a reusable cup discount of 25p on drinks if you bring your own reusable cup to our stores. This can be any reusable cup, not only a Starbucks one."  TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has said he is "delighted" that the problem of unrecycled coffee cups has attracted government attention.  Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose #wastenot campaign has gathered more than 300,000 supporters, said Mr Stewart's intervention should "help focus the coffee companies' minds on finding a solution".	politics

It comes after George Osborne announced in the Budget that employers would have to contribute more to pensions for NHS staff, teachers and the police.  He said individual pensions would not be affected.  The Treasury said employers had three years to get ready for the changes and would be helped by low inflation.  The technical changes to the way public sector pensions are valued mean departments face contributing more to their overall cost from 2019 - effectively saving the Treasury around £2bn billion a year.  As a result, Commons library figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show, the NHS will have to find an estimated £650m per year.  The changes will also see pension contributions for teachers rise by more than £400m, the Armed Forces by more than £300m and police forces by more than £100m.  BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said some ministers had asked for clarification over how the changes would impact on their budgets, but so far there had been no suggestion the extra cost would be shouldered by the Treasury.  The health and schools budgets are protected but both are already under pressure and this decision will add to the strain, she added - and the extra cost to the NHS would wipe out the real terms increase ministers have pledged for 2019-20.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the cuts were being "sneaked through" and would ultimately mean less money to spend on teachers, doctors, nurses and the police.  "It will mean the NHS, it will mean schools, it will mean the armed forces, it will mean the police," he told Radio 4's Today. "It takes that money directly out of the front line of those services."  Mr Farron said the cuts would be "intolerable" even if they served a justifiable economic purpose but Mr Osborne was acting solely to try and meet his self-imposed goal of a budget surplus by 2020. "He has chosen to set targets which are unnecessary."  Treasury officials admitted there would be an additional cost for public sector employers but they had been aware the changes were coming.  "We're committed to regular revaluation to ensure public sector pension costs are met," a spokesman said.  "The Budget announcement means employers have three years to prepare and we think they should be well placed to absorb extra cost of contributions - especially because inflationary pressures are significantly lower than expected when budgets were set at spending review."  The figures were revealed in the aftermath of the Budget as Mr Osborne faced criticism for cuts to some disability payments and questions over whether he would hit his fiscal targets.	politics

"Clan loyalties" within parts of her community saw women blocked from political office, Naz Shah, MP for Bradford West, told BBC Newsnight.  Labour said it had the best record of any of the parties in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates.  But Ms Shah said in her experience of some areas, "the kind of misogyny that exists is quite shocking".  On one occasion she was excluded from a meeting where party members agreed to look for "evidence to desecrate my character", she said.  One person had a print-out of a photograph of Ms Shah at a party which was used to suggest she drank alcohol, she said.  "Because I'm a Muslim woman who lives in Bradford, that would really be very damaging for me culturally," she said.  "It was just a picture of a friend and me at a party, and that was it - there was a bar behind, but I've not got a drink in my hand. I don't drink alcohol. But it's damaging."  She added that there were some "very dubious practices" within some wards within her constituency where there was "a higher volume of Pakistani membership. That is a fact."  "It's a culture of gatekeeping. It's a culture of power politics for the sake of having power, and that power resides with men," she said.  "It's family loyalties, it's clan loyalties, it goes back to a Pakistani model of doing things."  She said some "good guys" in the community had advised her not to challenge it, saying "they will ruin you, just back down".  But she had felt compelled to speak out because "politics needs women, and women deserve better".  "We should be transparent and open and if there is anything that we need to be doing, including an inquiry, we should be doing it," she said.  She had had the utmost support from Labour leadership, and would be meeting party leader Jeremy Corbyn soon, she added.  Newsnight has previously reported claims by Muslim women within the Labour party that they are blocked and intimidated out of local politics by cliques of men within the party from south Asian communities.  Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, previously told Newsnight he had felt "extremely pressured to be silent on the things I know to be true".  "I've been disappointed with the response from the Labour Party".  Last month the charity Muslim Women's Network UK wrote to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.  The Labour Party says it has been "at the forefront of the fight for women's equality". It added: "We have transformed the representation of women in politics."  "Any complaints or evidence of sexism or intimidation received by the Labour party are dealt with fairly according to our procedures and the law"	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35806264	Will consultants swallow Hunt's remedy?	Sooner or later the government in England will table an offer to consultants to reform their contract.  British Medical Association negotiators will then, in all likelihood, ask the union's members what they think - and that could set in train a process that could make or break not just the junior doctors' dispute but also Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's approach to the NHS.  While the dispute with junior doctors has dominated everyone's attention, the government has also been meeting with the BMA about the consultant contract.  It is all part of the desire for a "seven-day NHS". The current contract has an optout that allows doctors to refuse to do non-emergency weekend work.  That results in hospitals having to pay large sums in overtime payments - sometimes three to four times the normal rate - to get consultants in on Saturdays to do routine work.  While they don't like it, there is an acknowledgement among consultants' leaders that the optout will have to go. The BMA effectively acknowledged as much by entering talks with ministers in October, after Jeremy Hunt told them if they didn't he would impose the changes on them as he is doing with junior doctors.  There is also an acceptance among many that if they resist they would struggle to garner the same public support junior doctors have, given that the average salary for a consultant is more than £80,000 (and that is before overtime payments and any private work are taken into account).  It is one of the reasons why the talks have gone amicably compared to the juniors and why in normal circumstances there would be reason to believe that a reasonable offer by the government would have a good chance of getting voted through by the membership.  But, of course, we are not in a normal situation. While these talks have been staged separately from the junior doctor negotiations, they're not taking place in a vacuum.  Consultants know if they agree to any offer, it will leave their junior colleagues horribly exposed as ministers push ahead with the imposition of their contract. How much will this influence any decision they are asked to make?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the BMA is giving consideration to allowing some junior doctors at the end of their training - senior juniors if you like - the opportunity to vote on any deal.  Depending on the numbers, that clearly has the potential to influence the outcome. Of course, all this is hypothetical - an offer hasn't even been made yet.  But if it is (and I am told it could come in the next week or two) it will pose a real dilemma for the medical profession.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35833997	People with autism 'die younger', warns charity	People with autism are dying earlier then the general population, often through epilepsy or suicide, a charity has warned.  Citing recent research carried out in Sweden, the charity Autistica described the problem as an "enormous hidden crisis".  The study, in the British Journal of Psychiatry, suggested autistic people die on average 16 years early.  The charity now wants to raise £10m for more research into the condition.  In the UK it is estimated 1% of the population - or 700,000 people - have autism and it causes difficulties in how they communicate and relate to others.  The Swedish study looked at the health records of 27,000 autistic adults and used 2.7 million people as a control sample for the general population.  The research, carried out by the Karolinska Institute, found that those with autism and an associated learning disability, died more than 30 years early - with the average age of death being 39.  In this group of people, a leading cause of death was epilepsy.  Scientists still cannot exactly explain the link between autism and epilepsy, which is partly why the charity wants to raise the money over the next five years to enable more research.  The Swedish study also suggested that people with autism, who were not held back by any intellectual disability, died on average 12 years younger - at 58 years old rather than 70.  After heart disease, suicide was the most common cause of death for this group of people.  Past research has suggested that autistic women are more at risk of suicide than men and only half of autistic people who have considered suicide were categorised as depressed - although this latter point may be down to problems with communication in diagnosis.  The research, which was published online in November 2015, was carried out by Dr Tatja Hirvikoski, who described her findings as "shocking and disheartening" and she said there was an "urgent need for increased knowledge".  Autistica's chief executive Jon Spiers told the BBC the number of deaths in autistic adults was an "enormous hidden crisis".  "The inequality in outcomes for autistic people shown in this data is shameful," he said.  As a "spectrum" condition, it impacts on people in different ways and has symptoms that range from mild to very severe.  Around a quarter of people with autism speak very few or no words, while statistically only 15% go on to find full-time employment.  And almost three-quarters of people have at least one associated mental health condition, while 40% have two, the charity said.  Autistica also wants the government to carry out a national autism mortality review, and a petition demanding this action will be delivered to Downing Street later in the year.  Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, said the situation could be even worse in the UK.  "We have no reason to believe the situation would be that different here," he added.  A Department of Health spokesperson said: "We have made monumental strides in the way we treat conditions such as autism in this country, but we must speed up progress even further.  "That is why we are working alongside people with autism, and their carers, to make sure they have access to healthcare with adjustments made for their conditions."  Gill Ackers is the mother to Ellie, 19, who has autism and recently began having seizures.  She said: "Seeing your child suffer a seizure is shocking and painful enough.  "To know that as someone with autism they are also more likely to die early from epilepsy is a double blow.  "We need proper answers and we need them now. We cannot simply stand by and watch people with autism die because of a lack of research and specialised care."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35834142	Deal reached to scrap 'tampon tax', officials say	EU leaders have agreed a deal that will allow the UK to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", British officials say.  Two options have been put forward that would permit a zero rate of tax on sanitary products.  It comes amid the threat of a backbench rebellion following the Budget from Eurosceptic MPs over the tax, currently at the lowest rate allowed by EU law.  Chancellor George Osborne said the government "heard people's anger over paying the tampon tax loud and clear".  VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products - but more than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  Mr Osborne had pledged to spend the proceeds of the tax on women's charities.  "We said we'd use the money to benefit women's charities and we've already distributed £17m to good causes across the country," he said.  "At the same time we said we'd fight for agreement to reduce the VAT rate to zero, and tonight all European leaders have welcomed our plan to do just that. We've achieved what no British government has even tried to achieve.  "It just shows how Britain can make a case for a reform that will benefit millions as a powerful, confident voice inside a reformed EU."  At the European Council summit in Brussels, the 28 leaders agreed a statement welcoming "the intention of the Commission to include proposals for increased flexibility for member states with respect to reduced rates of VAT, which will provide the option to member states of VAT zero-rating sanitary products".  BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government had managed to avoid a Commons defeat by reaching the agreement.  A great British victory or an obvious bit of spin? Number 10 says David Cameron has come to Brussels and won the backing of all EU leaders for his plan to abolish VAT on women's sanitary products.  With the EU referendum looming, the long-running campaign to get tampons zero rated is pulling in support from Tory MPs backing Brexit. A dicey vote on the finance bill loomed next week. Now the European Commission may have defused this political problem.  For months it has been listening to EU member states complain the existing EU rules on reduced and zero-rated VAT are too rigid and past their sell by date. The UK, of course, has a particular complaint about not being allowed to cut VAT on tampons below 5% and has asked for change.  Earlier, the Commission confirmed it will publish its "Action Plan" on VAT next Wednesday. It would include two options for change that would allow countries more flexibility over VAT. Hours later, Number 10 trumpeted that a line will be included in the Council conclusions stating EU leaders welcome the Commission's move "which would provide the option to member states of VAT zero rating for sanitary products".  So at some point down the line, the government looks set to scrap VAT on tampons. The EU has moved. But it was likely to do so whether David Cameron lobbied for the move here at this summit or not.  A number of Conservative MPs have threatened to vote for an amendment to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Tuesday to allow the zero-rating of women's sanitary products.  Those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU in 23 June's referendum have been keen to highlight the role of Brussels in setting VAT rates.  Mr Cameron raised the issue with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of the EU summit, Downing Street said.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who has tabled the Finance Bill amendment, said: "Women's sanitary products are not a luxury. George Osborne failed to take the opportunity in his Budget to say that he would take the action called for by Labour and feminist campaigners and seek to get the 'tampon tax' abolished."  The European Commission said it was working on two options that would allow member states more flexibility over setting VAT rates.  A Commission spokeswoman said: "EU VAT rules are not imposed by the European Commission. They are decided on and agreed unanimously by member states.  "Contrary to some media reports, tampons do benefit from reduced taxation."  She added that under current rules, member states were not allowed to apply a zero VAT rate to a product unless all other member states agreed.  "Zero rates are an exception and run against generally accepted VAT principles. Most member states tax sanitary products like tampons at around 20% or more," she added.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35830452	Minister Justin Tomlinson defends 'cuts' to disability payments	The minister for disabled people has defended planned changes to support payments aimed at saving £1.3bn, amid growing calls for a U-turn.  Justin Tomlinson told BBC News there would still be an increase in the number of people claiming Personal Independence Payments (PIP).  And more money would be directed at the people who "needed it most".  Labour and some Tory MPs are threatening to derail the change, spelt out in Wednesday's Budget.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled" and Tory MP Andrew Percy said he had gone "too far" and the changes were "just not acceptable".  "This hits exactly the wrong people, potentially. I think it sends out the wrong message about the priorities of the government," he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.  He said the changes were more about helping Mr Osborne meet his self-imposed cap on overall welfare spending than reforming the benefits system.  Mr Tomlinson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg 640,000 people would be affected by the changes in 2020-21 - but it did "necessarily mean they will lose their benefit".  "They might lose one of the points in the assessment but a significant chunk of that 640,000 will continue to receive the benefit," he said.  He said it was a "future measure", which would only affect current claimants when they came up for reassessment.  "We will still see an increase in the numbers of people using PIP and the amount of money paid out," he added.  He said the government was committed to improving the system and that more people were receiving the payments at the highest end of the scale.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies said 370,000 people would lose out under the planned changes, with an average loss of £3,500 a year.  PIP claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week and are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive.  The money is meant to help people cope with the extra cost of living with a disability or long-term health problem and are used to fund everything from mobility cars to adapted baths and showers.  The weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  It follows an independent review, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, which said a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal-to-no ongoing daily living extra costs.  But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  Asked on BBC Breakfast about whether cuts to PIP were harming the most vulnerable in society, Mr Osborne said: "We have got to make sure we have a system that works.  "I'm always happy to listen to proposals about how improve on that but we have got to control our disability budget and make sure help goes to the people who need it most."  Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Owen Smith said: "There is no political, economic or moral justification for George Osborne's decision to cut support for disabled people while increasing tax benefits for the wealthiest, symbolising the unfairness of his Budget.  "I do not believe that those who voted Conservative at the last election did so to see a further £4 billion stripped away from people who may require assistance when washing or dressing."  He said Labour would resist any attempt by the government to push through the changes in secondary legislation, without a full debate in Parliament.  Why George Osborne has a problem with disability benefits.  1. Introducing the new Personal Independence Payment for disabled people has saved much less money than expected. There was "little evidence" for the original optimistic savings assessment says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has repeatedly reduced its forecast.  2. More people are getting PIP than the government expected, and they are being paid more. Average awards were expected to be £86 a week. In fact they will be £100.  3, The government can boast it is spending more on disability benefits. The bill rises by about £1bn over the next five years. Had it not been for the most recent cuts it would have been yet higher - by an extra £1bn. Despite the overall bill rising individuals will see cuts to their payments.  4. The problem could get worse. Even after the latest cuts there is "considerable uncertainty" about the figures on future savings says the OBR.  5. It's a big political problem. If Mr Osborne U-turns he will have to find more than a billion pounds of savings elsewhere, and doubts about his ability to reach a surplus will intensify.  One lifelong Conservative voter, Graeme Ellis, said he had quit the party over the cuts - and made his views known on the official website of the Conservative Disability Group, on whose executive he has served.  "This website is temporarily closed owing to Disability Cuts," a message read after Mr Osborne confirmed the cuts.  "The owner of the hosting package, Graeme Ellis, has resigned over disability cuts from the group and will no longer develop or host this site."  The message was later amended to stress that no other member of the group was involved in the action and they had not known about it in advance.  Mr Ellis, a former NHS worker who has diabetes and uses a wheelchair, said Mr Osborne was "destroying lives".  "I've been a Conservative voter since I could vote. But as a lifelong Conservative I could no longer agree with what the Government's doing," he told the Mirror.  A Conservative Party spokesman said: "The Conservative Disability Group has not deactivated its website.  "The owner of the domain, who is no longer a member of the group, has deactivated it without any instruction to do so."	politics

There has been a row brewing at Westminster for some time over cuts to so-called Short money.  But sources are confident MPs will back a plan that will save 10% from the total in a vote expected on Wednesday.  Ministers say Short money payments are unduly generous given cutbacks elsewhere in the public sector.  In November, George Osborne's Autumn Statement revealed plans to cut the funding - named after former Labour MP Ted Short - by 19%, saying this would be in line with savings expected of unprotected Whitehall departments.  The plans have been strongly criticised by opposition parties.  The proposed compromise would shift the formula for calculating the payments from taking account of the Retail Price Index to instead using the Consumer Price Index.  Over the last 12 months the CPI has grown by a far smaller rate than the RPI - so the switch makes the new formula less generous.  It will necessitate what a source described as "much greater transparency" over what the money is spent on.  In addition, it will set a floor below which Short money cannot fall for the smallest parties in the House of Commons - those with between one and five MPs.  That floor is £75,000 a year. There is also a ceiling for those parties, of just over £200,000.  Between now the end of the decade sources claim the compromise arrangement will save the taxpayer around £3.5m.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35834904	A Budget conspiracy?	From time to time, you know I like to pass on some of the conspiracy theories that do the rounds in Westminster.  If that's not your bag, then please don't proceed any further, I won't take it personally.  Of course today, most people in SW1 are firmly in the Budget day two phase, quite rightly poring over the detail as think tanks and independent number crunchers get their hands on it, and in this case, as Tory backbenchers' tempers rise over some of the proposals.  But one question that remains unanswered is why did chancellor decided to undertake what's been described as the biggest ever reduction in borrowing right at the end of the Parliament to magically meet his political target?  Maybe you need a conspiracy theory to answer that.  And this time, the theories centre around George Osborne's ambitions to move into Number 10.  One minister told me, this is all about "next generation George", by pushing cuts and consolidation to the last possible moment in the Parliament.  He would therefore be trying to secure the top job when people are feeling more flush due to income tax cuts and the pain from last minute austerity hasn't yet been felt. This is "fixing the leadership when the sun is shining", they suggested.  But another source suggests something even more devilish.  It's pointless, they suggest, being bemused by the seemingly strange timing of it all.  Traditionally governments are tough on spending when they are fresh from election victory, then softer towards the end.  This time, it's the other way round.  No need for confusion though, this conspiracy implies. The simple reason is that this Parliament is never going to make it to the end of its fixed term in 2020. And that means the cuts, that pain in 2020, is simply never going to happen because there will be a general election long before. And, a different man or woman with their hands on the Red Box.  Yes, I know there is a law that makes it hard for the government to get out of the 2020 timeline - the Fixed Term Parliament Act was written under the coalition to protect its stability. But it is not at all impossible.  Some in Westminster's giant gossip chamber believe the Tory leadership is "champing at the bit" to take that chance.  The theoretical prize is an early election after the Tories have settled their leadership succession, before Labour's unhappy MPs have had the chutzpah to sort out theirs.  The argument goes, George Osborne newly installed in Number 10, doesn't have to make the big cuts, dissolves Parliament, goes to the country and beats Jeremy Corbyn's Labour to a pulp.  Try raising any of this on the record with any politician? You don't get very far.  Try raising it off the record, you don't get that far either.  But there are people who believe this conspiracy could well be the Tory leadership's dream.  There are plenty of people of course on all sides of the House of Commons who would be determined to stop them.  And conspiracies normally of course remain just that, theories that the political anoraks enjoy mulling over.  But who knows, very occasionally they can turn out to be true.  We'll have to wait rather a long time to see if this one does.	politics

The chancellor was forced to revise down his growth forecasts and admit he had missed key targets in his Budget.  He blamed global factors - but Labour said his credibility was "completely shot" and said he was cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  Mr Osborne insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was still on course to clear the deficit.  But he added the proviso that it would happen "in normal times when the economy is growing".  Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the chance of Mr Osborne hitting his target was "only about a 50-50 shot" and he would need to impose "proper" tax rises or spending cuts if there was any further downgrade in public finances.  He said the chancellor had "managed to shift quite a lot money around" to try and meet his target but he can only "get away with this once".  The IFS has said in a report that there will have to be an extra year of austerity as a result of Wednesday's Budget, with £10bn in spending cuts pencilled in for after the next general election.  "Even if we get a surplus the surplus in 2019/20 we will have to have another year of pain to stay there the following year," Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's The World at One..  He also questioned the chancellor's decision to freeze fuel duty, which raises about £30bn a year, for the sixth year in a row, particularly as falling oil prices had already reduced the cost of driving a car to its lowest level in decades.  "If this continues not to rise - and it is beginning to look like it will never go up again - that is a big black hole in the public finances for the medium term," he added.  The chancellor has also missed his target to get debt falling as a proportion of national income and his self-imposed cap on welfare spending.  Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell told the BBC News Channel: "I think George Osborne's credibility is completely shot. He has missed virtually every one of his targets. People are rightly sceptical that he will now miss his surplus target."  He said Labour would spend more to grow the economy but would have the "additional discipline that you reduce debt as a portion of GDP within the 5 years".  He also criticised Mr Osborne's "morally reprehensible" £1.3bn a year cut to disability payments under the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) scheme.  He claimed Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled" - a charge which the chancellor denied, saying overall spending on disability was increasing and the government was making "sure we help the most vulnerable in our society".  Mr Osborne's headline grabbing announcement of a tax on sugary drinks to combat childhood obesity was welcomed by Labour.  But a Conservative rebellion is brewing over VAT on sanitary products, which is currently charged at 5%, the lowest rate allowable under EU law.  More than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  In his Budget Mr Osborne said the proceeds of the tax would be distributed among women's organisations.  He has rejected calls from Eurosceptic Conservatives to defy the EU by unilaterally scrapping the tax, telling the Today programme he expected to get agreement from Brussels on it "in the next few days".  Prime Minister David Cameron is set to raise the issue "on the margins" of a summit he is attending in Brussels, Downing Street said.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff has, meanwhile, tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill that would scrap the so-called "tampon tax". Labour will back the motion, which it said was attracting cross-party support.  With three months until the referendum on the UK's EU membership, the chancellor also used his Budget speech to warn against voting to leave.  He quoted a line from an Office for Budget Responsibility report which said there appeared to be "a greater consensus that a vote to leave would result in a period of potentially disruptive uncertainty while the precise details of the UK's new relationship with the EU were negotiated".  Leave campaigners, including London Mayor Boris Johnson and Commons Leader Chris Grayling, have dismissed claims there would be years of uncertainty as scaremongering.  Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote told the BBC's Newsnight programme the organisation had not done any projections about the implications of a Brexit - and the chancellor was wrong to imply it had.  A number of economists had said there could be a period of uncertainty which could have implications for financial markets, which the report cited, "but we made no explicit judgement ourselves", he said.  The chancellor has staked his reputation on his economic credibility, even imposing a set of tight fiscal targets on himself. So far he's missed two; cutting debt as a proportion of GDP this year and capping welfare spending.  Now economic analysts warn he could struggle to meet his most coveted - a budget surplus by the end of the Parliament.  Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies will focus on the chancellor's ability to clear the deficit - particularly in light of changing economic forecasts and downward revisions in growth.  Mr Osborne said he was taking difficult decisions to provide long-term stability for the next generation.  He found money to cut income tax and business rates, help savers and invest in roads and schools - but some in the chancellor's own party are questioning his decision to cut disability payments.  And Eurosceptic MPs are threatening to rebel unless the government listens to calls to abolish tax on sanitary products - which is set by the EU.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35824424	Sugar tax: How bold is it?	The announcement by Chancellor George Osborne that a tax on sugary drinks is to be introduced came as a surprise - ministers had spent months suggesting they were against the idea. But just how bold is it?  There are two ways of looking at it. Firstly, the government has made a pretty radical step. Only a handful of countries have introduced such a levy and for a right-of-centre administration to do so is quite remarkable, and shows a strong commitment to tackling child obesity.  The other - less generous interpretation - is that they were backed into a corner. Not only did pretty much the whole health lobby want it to happen, but TV chef Jamie Oliver led a pretty impressive campaign - a petition he set up attracted more than 150,000 signatures. No government wants to get on the wrong side of public opinion.  But the more important question is whether this will have an impact on child obesity rates. One in 10 children start primary school obese. By the end, one in five are obese. If you add in those who are overweight, it's one in three.  There are many reasons for this. Children are more sedentary than they use to be - as are adults. And our diets are simply not good enough.  Earlier this year the Food Foundation produced a mode of a typical family's diet. Every member consumed too much sugar and saturated fat and too little fibre, fruit, vegetables and oily fish.  So why tax sugar? All age groups consume at least twice as much as they should. Teenagers have three times as much - with sugary drinks their biggest source of the sweet stuff.  It's easy to understand why. A typical can of fizzy drink contains enough sugar to take both adults and children over their recommended amount.  There is evidence to suggest that a tax will have an impact on this. When Mexico introduced a tax of 10%, consumption fell by 6%.  Indeed, the Office of Budgetary Responsibility, which provides economic forecasts for ministers, has already done some modelling. Its assumption is that for the government to raise the £520m a year it has said it will, it will need to introduce a levy of 18p and 24p per litre (the plan is for two tax bands depending on how much sugar is in the drink).  The government has not confirmed whether this is the level being thought about as it wants to carry out a consultation. But it is as good a figure as we have at this stage.  The analysis predicts that there will be a 5% drop in sales of the highest sugar drinks, but a 2% rise in lower sugar drinks. That would seem to be a pretty minor gain.  But in a way campaigners say that misses the point. The sugar tax carries a symbolic message. That is to say obesity is now such a serious problem that it requires direct intervention. Short of a ban, a tax is arguably the next toughest measure open to a government.  However, this should not be seen in isolation. The government is expected to publish its much delayed child obesity strategy in the summer. That could include restrictions on advertising and marketing, as well as a sustained campaign to reduce the sugar content of foods and drinks across the board.  A sugar tax may be in the headlines at the moment, but it looks like it will just be the start of the fight against our bulging waistlines. We will have to wait and see to judge just how bold the government really is.	health

The team found patients who were given electrical stimulation alongside rehabilitation sessions fared better than people given rehab alone.  Volunteers who had the electrical treatment saw greater improvements when moving their arms, and some found it easier to do everyday tasks.  The study, published in the Journal of Science Translational Medicine, involved 24 people who had had strokes at least six months before the trial began and still experienced difficulties while moving their arms or hands.  Each volunteer had nine sessions of intensive rehabilitation where they were encouraged to move their affected limbs.  And for the first twenty minutes of each session 11 had additional therapy - known as transcranial direct current stimulation - where electrodes were placed on the participant's scalp above the affected area of the brain, and a low current was applied.  The others had a dummy treatment - with just seconds of electrical stimulation before the machine was switched off.  Researchers found all patients had improved - but the biggest improvements were seen in patients who had prolonged electrical stimulation.  And improvements persisted three months after rehab stopped.  One patient, for example, found he could feed himself more easily after the treatment and others were better able to lift, grasp or reach for objects.  But improvements varied, partly depending on the severity of the initial stroke.  According to brain scans, the group that had electrical stimulation also showed increased activity in regions of the brain related to movement.  Jan, a study volunteer, said: "I have definitely improved and benefited. People who haven't seen me say 'Wow - you can move better now'".  She added: "The stimulation didn't hurt - more like a mild tingle or a static electric shock right on top of my head. The worst part was that my head itched afterwards!"  Lead researcher Prof Johansen-Berg, said she was excited by the results and hypothesised that the therapy worked by boosting the ability of the brain to re-wire after strokes.  But she cautioned more extensive trials were needed and said the benefits and costs would need to be weighed up before the programme could be offered in hospitals.  Shamim Quadir of the charity the Stroke Association said the study was an important step towards bigger trials.  He added: "Stroke is one of the largest causes of disability and more than half of stroke survivors are left dependent on others for help with everyday activities.  "It is crucial that we find alternative ways to help improve the recovery rates from this devastating condition."	health

The results come from 150,000 UK adults aged 40 or older who agreed to be measured and weighed and fill in a survey about their typical journey to and from work.  Cycling came out as the best activity for staying trim, followed by walking.  But even those who used public transport were leaner than car users.  The authors of the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology study say the findings show even a little physical activity is better than nothing at all.  They reached their conclusions by comparing the bodyweights and lifestyles of the 72,999 men and 83,667 women in their study.  Even when they factored in differences such as leisure-time, exercise, diet and occupation, the trend between commute method and bodyweight remained.  And for both cycling and walking, greater travelling distances were associated with greater reductions in percentage body fat.  By their calculations, an "average" height man would weigh around 5kg (11lbs) less if he were to cycle rather than drive to work each day.  Likewise, the average height woman would weigh 4.4kg (9.7lbs) less.  In the study, 64% of men and 61% of women commuted by car, while 4% of men and 2% of women reported cycling or doing a mix of cycling and walking.  In England and Wales, 23.7 million people regularly commute to work and around two-thirds do so by car, according to census data.  Study author Dr Ellen Flint, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "We know that physical activity can help prevent obesity - absolutely we do - and yet, two thirds of the UK population don't achieve weekly recommended levels of physical activity.  "This study shows basically that people who do manage to build some level of physical exertion into their commute, even if it's just walking to a bus stop or cycling a short distance, they tend to be less heavy and have less body fat than people who drive all the way to work."  She said it was important that policy makers and town planners make it easy for people to walk and cycle to work.  "It's a win, win really for public health and the environment," she said.	health

Ministers want to require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party.  But peers voted by 320 to 172 to apply the changes to new members only and with a 12-month transition period.  Business Minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe said the change was not aimed at Labour Party finances.  The vote on political levies was one of three defeats for the government's Trade Union Bill.  Peers also voted to commission an independent review of electronic balloting for industrial action - which ministers have rejected - and against a cap on the amount of paid time public sector workers can spend on trade union activity.  Trade unions' political funds can be used for political campaigning and to make donations.  If an opt-in is introduced, Labour believes three million fewer members of the biggest unions would agree to pay into them, costing it £6m.  In January, peers voted to set up a cross-party committee so the proposals were more closely examined.  The committee concluded the changes should only apply to new members of a trade union, not existing ones.  Its chairman, crossbencher Lord Burns, said the Conservative manifesto had been "loosely worded" on the matter, and said the amendment did not break the government's manifesto commitment to introduce a "transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions".  "It avoids the trap of being drawn into a war on political funding," Lord Burns said.  The committee also said the issue of existing members opting-in to the political levy should be considered as part of a wider review into party funding.  Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon said the government's plans were designed to make opting in as difficult as possible to have a negative impact on Labour.  "It will have a disproportionate, unnecessary impact on trade union political funds," she said.  But Lady Neville-Rolfe said she did not understand why opt-in should apply to new members but not existing ones as she described the committee's recommendation as a "wrecking amendment".  "It is not acceptable in many areas of daily life to automatically deduct payment for a cause that has not been actively consented to," she added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35813973	Sugar tax surprise in Budget	George Osborne has unveiled a tax on sugary drinks in a wide ranging Budget dominated by gloomier growth forecasts.  The chancellor blamed the slowdown on a "dangerous cocktail" of global risks and said the UK had to "act now so we don't have to pay later".  He announced an extra £3.5bn in spending cuts - and sparked controversy by warning of the risks of EU exit.  But Labour contrasted a lowering of corporation tax with cuts to disability payments.  The £530m raised by a tax on the sugar content of soft drinks - the equivalent of about 18-24p per litre, the government says - will be spent on primary school sports in England, with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland free to decide how to spend their share.  Mr Osborne's sugar tax announcement sparked a big fall in the share price of soft drinks makers but it was welcomed by TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has been campaigning for such a move.  The tax will be levied on the volume of the sugar-sweetened drinks companies produce or import.  The Office for Budget Responsibility says it could result in a "pretty substantial price rise" on products - as much as 80% on, for example, a two-litre bottle of own-brand cola.  There will be two bands - one for total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 millilitres; a second, higher band for the most sugary drinks with more than 8 grams per 100 millilitres, with the levels yet to be set.  Examples of drinks which would currently fall under the higher rate of the sugar tax include full-strength Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Lucozade Energy and Irn-Bru, the Treasury said. The lower rate would catch drinks such as Dr Pepper, Fanta, Sprite, Schweppes Indian tonic water and alcohol-free shandy.  BBC health editor Hugh Pym said the tax had come as "a bolt from the blue" - particularly as Downing Street had opposed the idea last autumn. It was attacked at the time by some Conservative MPs as "nannystate-ism".  Read more about how it will work  How has Osborne's spoonful of sugar tax gone down?  In his biggest Parliamentary test to date, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn delivered the Opposition's response, describing Mr Osborne's Budget as "the culmination of six years of his failures" which had "unfairness at its core".  The Labour leader said the financial proposals failed on productivity, investment and in tackling inequality - and gave tax cuts to the wealthy while disabled people lost more than £1bn.  But he welcomed Mr Osborne's sugar tax, which will be introduced in two years' time and will not apply to fruit juices or milk-based drinks.  Announcing the move, Mr Osborne said: "I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this Parliament, doing this job and say to my children's generation: 'I'm sorry - we knew there was a problem with sugary drinks. We knew it caused disease. But we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing'."  Mr Osborne said the UK was still on course to clear its deficit by 2019/20 thanks to the extra spending cuts.  But in a move that has angered Conservative colleagues who want the UK to leave the EU, he cited the Office for Budget Responsibility's view that the UK would be "safer, stronger and more secure" if it remains in.  Tory MP and Leave campaigner David Davis said: "The real risks for Britain lie in remaining within the EU."  Mr Osborne's package includes a £1.5bn plan to turn all state schools into academies.  In other Budget announcements, Mr Osborne committed £300m for transport projects, although almost half of the money committed was announced in the Autumn Statement.  The lower growth forecast from 2.4% to 2% in 2016 was driven by a reduction in the OBR's productivity forecasts.  The OBR also said the government was going to breach its own welfare cap in every remaining year of this Parliament.  The additional spending is mainly caused by more people than expected being eligible for disability benefits, with the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) scheme costing £3bn more than expected in July.  Cuts aimed at saving £1.3bn were announced last week.  There will be new action to tackle overseas retailers who store goods in Britain and sell them online without paying VAT - and new tax free allowances for "micro entrepreneurs" who rent their homes or sell services through the internet.  Reforms to business rates will mean 6,000 small businesses pay no rates and 250,000 have their rates cuts from April 2017, said Mr Osborne.  He announced a major overhaul of the North Sea tax regime aimed at helping the UK's oil and gas industry, effectively abolishing the Petroleum Revenue Tax.  The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie welcomed the move - but criticised the overall Budget package, saying Mr Osborne had "failed to tackle the debt, the deficit and the borrowing as he promised" and urging him to abandon austerity and invest more in growth.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35823392	Can Osborne defy political history?	Hold your nerve - you can cut public spending for ten years, and keep voters on side.  Hold your nerve - you can keep your credibility despite missing target after target, even breaking your own self-imposed rules.  Hold your nerve - you can promise tax cuts for millions of workers despite a much bleaker picture in the world economy.  Hold your nerve - you can make big reforms despite a small majority.  Political history tells us ALL of that cannot be true. But as ever, George Osborne hopes, that precedent may not apply to him.  Despite expectation, this Budget was not dull, it was not timid.  The chancellor heralded bold changes that will change people's lives, and the terms of business for many thousands of firms - that tax on sugary drinks a surprise, perhaps designed to distract from the worse economic picture, dragging productivity and bleaker numbers.  There were vows too of higher tax thresholds, more powers moving from Whitehall, a totally new alternative to pensions. There's no question the chancellor wanted to show that he and the government have not run out of ideas.  But none of that can hide the big truth. The country is now expected to be less well off for years, to grow more slowly, even if ahead of our rivals.  We are less prosperous than the chancellor told us in November, and will be for some time.  What we are asked to believe is that then, suddenly, as if by magic, money will flow back to lead us into the black just before the next general election.  Like with all Budgets, there is nothing remotely certain about this coming to pass.  But the outline of that promise more than hints at the chancellor's own long-term aspirations.  That if he holds his nerve, he can follow David Cameron into Number 10 - despite the mistakes and miscalculations of recent months.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35825091	Budget 2016: How has Osborne's spoonful of sugar tax gone down?	One of the major talking points following this year's Budget is the introduction of a new tax on sugary soft drinks to tackle childhood obesity.  The £530m raised by a levy on the sugar content of soft drinks will be spent on primary school sports, according to Chancellor George Osborne.  There was mixed reaction to the new levy with some sweet on the idea, but others slightly more bitter.  In the immediate hours after the Chancellor delivered his Budget, the hashtag #Budget2016 was tweeted an estimated 175,000 times, while the search term "sugar tax" was used around 14,000 times on the social media platform.  Some referred to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Opposition response, where he welcomed Mr Osborne's sugar tax but said the Budget overall had "unfairness at its core".  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver - an exponent of healthier diets, particularly among children - quickly posted his reaction on Instagram which got over 40,000 likes.  Again, the reaction in turn to the celebrity campaigner's tweet was both sweet and sour.  Meanwhile, the exact sugary drinks to be affected became an issue in itself with some choosing to focus on the various - political and non-political - implications for the brands in question and their loyal customers.  Many were also quick to notice the fact - crucially for some - that while a tax had been placed on sugary beverages, beer and cider duty were left alone, along with any levy on whisky and other spirits.  Clearly an issue that affects all ages and lifestyles, then - regardless of their political persuasion.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35823383	Budget 2016: Jeremy Corbyn attacks Osborne's 'failure'	Jeremy Corbyn said the Budget had "unfairness at its very core" as he responded to George Osborne.  The Labour leader said the chancellor's statement was "a Budget of failure" on the deficit, investment and inequality.  He attacked cuts to disability benefits and criticised "mate's rates" corporate tax deals - but welcomed a new levy on sugary drinks.  Mr Osborne also announced extra spending cuts of £3.5bn and an increase in the higher tax threshold.  He said his Budget - which also includes forcing all state schools to become academies - "puts the next generation first".  But Mr Corbyn said only a Labour government could "harness the enthusiasm" of young people.  He said Mr Osborne's Budget was "the culmination of six years of his failures" accusing him of presiding over low productivity, investment and ambition, and failing to show a "real commitment" to ending inequality.  Despite the "rhetoric" of the Northern Powerhouse, Mr Corbyn said, there was "systematic under-investment in the North" and the government had "stood by as the steel industry bled".  He also attacked the government's record on home ownership, saying a generation had been "locked out" by its policies.  With some pollsters suggesting his own personal ratings are lower than any Labour leader since Michael Foot three decades ago, it was perhaps brave of Jeremy Corbyn to make failure the theme of his budget response.  Certainly it drew derision from the Conservative benches and the deputy speaker had to intervene several times to calm the atmosphere.  The Labour leader accused Chancellor George Osborne of "six years of failure" - failing to meet his own targets to balance the books and to rebalance the economy.  "The gulf between what the Conservative government expects from the wealthiest and what it demands from ordinary British taxpayers could not be greater," he said.  "The 'mate's rates' deals for big corporations on tax deals is something they will be forever remembered for.  "This is a chancellor who has produced a Budget for hedge fund managers more than for small businesses."  In his Commons address Mr Osborne, who promised a £10.4bn surplus by 2019-20, aimed a joke at Mr Corbyn, the Islington North MP, saying the proposed Crossrail 2 rail link was "good for people in North London who are heading south".  He also revised down growth forecasts, warned of the risks of an EU exit, and announced a £115 million package to help rough sleepers.  Responding to the homelessness announcement, John Healey, Labour's housing spokesman, said he welcomed the fact that Mr Osborne had "finally woken up to the fact there's a problem".  But he said five times as much had been cut from housing support in November's Spending Review.	politics

Certainly it drew derision from the Conservative benches and the deputy speaker had to intervene several times to calm the atmosphere.  The Labour leader accused Chancellor George Osborne of "six years of failure" - failing to meet his own targets to balance the books and to rebalance the economy.  And that F word was deployed time and again. George Osborne, he argued, had also failed on investment, productivity and tackling inequality,  In the Commons chamber, the Conservative chair of the Treasury Select Committee Andrew Tyrie acknowledged that it is the most difficult task an opposition leader faces - responding to a detailed budget of which he has no advance sight.  So a decision seemed to have been taken in advance by Labour's upper echelons to take a relatively risk-free approach, and denounce the things that were obviously going to be in the Budget rather than respond to the detail - though there was a welcome for the "surprise" sugar tax announcement.  Lower forecasts for growth were compared to the "lofty rhetoric" of the chancellor in past statements when he promised "a march of the makers".  And not for the first time austerity was criticised as a "political choice" - a point Jeremy Corbyn had made during the Labour leadership campaign and which was aimed at his internal as well as external opponents.  There was strident criticism in his speech of government cuts in personal independence payments for people with disabilities while corporation tax was being cut.  But there was no attempt to emulate the jaw-dropping response to the Autumn Statement last year - when the shadow chancellor and close Jeremy Corbyn ally John McDonnell produced a copy of Chairman Mao's little red book.  It was an attempt at political satire - highlighting the sale of British assets to a big foreign government and the chancellor's attempts to get more infrastructure investment from a country with a less than salubrious human rights record.  But it fell flat when the chancellor parried the attack by suggesting his left-wing opposite number was waving around his own "signed copy" and had sent shadow cabinet members to "re-education camps".  The whole episode meant less attention was devoted to a government u-turn on tax credits.  But there was a price - albeit a smaller one - to be paid by taking a more cautious route this time around. As the old adage goes, it's better to be talked about than not talked about.  Jeremy Corbyn's speech lacked focus at times, and wasn't exactly full of light and shade - often delivered in the same tone of voice. Some on his own frontbench were more distracted by their phones and texts than by his rhetoric.  Some on the backbenches quite simply chatted.  And perhaps because the Chamber was so full, some Labour MPs watched him from the gallery above. The line-up was a bit like a frontbench in exile, full of people who range from being mildly to extremely sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership in public or private.  As one former minister put it: "There was a good opening paragraph in his speech on Osborne's failure to hit his own targets but then he wasted the rest of it with a predictable list of cuts he didn't like. Apart from everything else he has no self discipline so can't stick to one key point."  Another former frontbencher put it more bluntly: "There was no coherent message and no credibility." A newer MP was more positive, praising a "good effort".  But it's unlikely the parliamentary party were the Labour leader's target audience.  As one of his MPs put it privately: "He wasn't light footed enough to respond to the government announcements and focused on "our people" as always. But it will warm the cockles of the Corbynistas."  And with rumours of a possible challenge to his position abounding at Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn did nothing to make his position less secure amongst grassroots party members and supporters who like his dividing lines with the government and who will vote in any leadership contest.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35824071	Sugar tax: How it will work?	A new sugar tax on the soft drinks industry will be introduced, the chancellor has announced as he unveiled his Budget.  It is something that has been talked about for some time, but has still come as a surprise.  The move has been hailed by campaigners as a significant step in the fight against child obesity.  The announcement applies to England, with the rest of the UK allowed to make its own decision on whether to introduce such a levy.  The levy is squarely aimed at high-sugar drinks, particularly fizzy drinks, which are popular among teenagers.  Pure fruit juices and milk-based drinks will be excluded and the smallest producers will have an exemption from the scheme.  It will be imposed on companies according to the volume of the sugar-sweetened drinks they produce or import.  There will be two bands - one for total sugar content above 5g per 100 millilitres and a second, higher band for the most sugary drinks with more than 8g per 100 millilitres.  The whole health community, more or less. In recent years campaigners have been putting forward a vociferous case for why a sugar levy is important in the fight against childhood obesity.  The most high-profile supporter has been TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has introduced a sugar levy in his restaurants. He set up an e-petition that saw more than 150,000 people backing a tax.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has also spoken out in favour of a tax and has announced the health service will be introducing its own "tax" in hospitals.  When it comes to a sugar tax, all the emphasis has been on drinks. There are a number of reasons for this.  Firstly, unlike a chocolate bar or slice of cake, they are not automatically seen as a treat. People who drink them tend to have them every day.  Secondly, some of the drinks are incredibly high in sugar. A typical can contains enough sugar - about nine teaspoons - to take someone over their recommended sugar intake in one hit.  For teenagers they are the number one source of sugar intake while overall, children get a third of their daily sugar intake from them.  They have also been dubbed "empty calories" as they have no nutritional benefit.  Mr Osborne said the money raised - an estimated £520m a year - will be spent on increasing the funding for sport in primary schools.  There has been pressure on ministers to increase spending in this area to build on the legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games and in light of the low numbers of children who take part in regular activity.  Research has shown that half of seven-year-olds do not do enough exercise.  At the start of primary school one in 10 children in England is obese (very overweight) and by the end it is one in five.  If you take into account pupils who are overweight, those figures rise to one in five and one in three respectively.  There are fears this could rise even further - although there are some signs obesity rates may be starting to level off.  The issue has been described as one of the most serious public health challenges for the 21st Century by the World Health Organization, while NHS England's Simon Stevens has dubbed it "the new smoking".	health

The analysis of several studies suggests 13% of women who enrol on smoking cessation programmes quit during pregnancy.  But 43% of these restart within six months of giving birth.  Public Health England says more action is needed to help mothers-to-be quit for good.  Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to many health problems including premature births, miscarriages, stillbirths and sudden infant deaths.  The scientists from the universities of Nottingham and York looked specifically at the success of women who used smoking cessation services to help them quit.  They pulled together several international trials, including some from the UK, involving almost 1,000 women who took part in stop smoking programmes between 1989 and 2014.  And they found only a minority of women who tried to quit smoking succeeded.  Official figures for England published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 11 percent of pregnant women were recorded as smokers at the time of giving birth in 2014-15, a steady decline from 15 percent in 2007.  But regional data shows wide differences across the country - with more smokers in poorer areas.  Prof Jonathan Grigg of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the findings of this study were a worrying sign for the state of child health.  He added: "We need to fully support parents in the first few months with their baby to highlight to them the importance of keeping their home smoke-free.  "Health visitor and smoking-cessation services are vital to this process, but with the £200m reduction in funding for public health, these services are at risk."  Rosanna O'Connor, at Public Health England, said: "While the rate of women smoking during pregnancy continues to fall, further action is needed to support those who find it more difficult to stop and to help those who do stop, to stop smoking forever.  "It is vital to protect babies from smoke during pregnancy and in the early months of life. The best protection for mothers, their babies and partners is to quit smoking for good."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35818167	No longer the 'lucky chancellor'?	If George Osborne was the "lucky chancellor" in November when the Treasury found an extra £27bn down the back of the Commons green benches, what will he be today?  How does he respond practically and politically to the fact that the numbers he based his plans on at the Spending Review have turned out to be wrong?  And not just those numbers, but much of the case that he'd been building in the year before feels, well, misplaced, now - that we were on our way "out of the red and back into the black", he had "fixed the roof" while the sun was shining, whichever Osborne metaphor you want to choose.  As my colleague Kamal Ahmed's written here, the backdrop is different. So first, George Osborne is going to have to fess up - the pages and pages of numbers the independent Office for Budget Responsibility provided as the basis of his sums won't add up anymore.  We know too - as he told me a few weeks ago - that means extra government cuts are likely, probably an additional £4bn billion a year by 2020.  So more cuts are on the way, on top of six years of spending reductions that have hit some families extremely hard.  But the government's announcement today on academy schools, and the fact the chancellor, not the education secretary, is making it, suggests something else too.  Numbers 10 and 11 are determined to make us believe they are interested in much more than just sorting out the books - they're not just cutters, but reformers too.  Even though those plans will cause strong complaint, they are part of George Osborne and David Cameron's plans to achieve more than just close the gap between what the government spends and takes from all of us in taxes - although they know that's proving hard enough.  And while the numbers are certainly worse than Number 11 had hoped, and the catchily-titled "downward revisions" will grab many of the headlines, George Osborne's political brain may tell him that economic changes have not knocked the (notoriously unreliable) predictions so far off course that it is worth any enormous deviation from his overall strategy.  So the chancellor, albeit in rather more sombre tones, is likely to echo his previous audacious claims that a Conservative government that is making significant cuts to state spending is composed of "the mainstream representatives of the working people".  He has been doing the job for six years now, and knows the dangers of a Budget that goes wrong, and one that goes with a bang. But with the Conservatives' ambitions, and his own, in mind, he is unlikely to miss the opportunity to make that case again.  Despite the shadow chancellor's new credo that aligns his hypothetical plans for tax and spend closely to those of Labour's recent past, even before George Osborne is on his feet John McDonnell is demanding that he stop the cuts.  One of the quirks of Budget day is that it will be for Jeremy Corbyn, not Mr McDonnell, to make that case, responding to Mr Osborne.  That is a tall order for any opposition leader. For Jeremy Corbyn, who enjoys huge support from the party's membership but not much from those sitting on the benches behind him, it is a huge ask.  But the opposition that really troubles Mr Osborne right now is those on his own benches. He'll be more interested in how they, and the public, respond - and if he's not the "lucky chancellor" any more, what they'll be calling him by the end of today.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35818169	Government defeated in Lords over immigration detention time limit	Ministers have been defeated in the Lords over limits on detention in immigration removal centres (IRC).  During the Immigration Bill debate, peers voted by 187 to 170 that detention must be limited to 28 days, except when a court decides otherwise.  The government had argued most of those detained either were foreign criminals, or had broken immigration rules before.  Opponents insisted the limit was needed because detaining people indefinitely had a negative impact on mental health.  It is the second time the government has been defeated over the bill. Lords voted a week ago to allow asylum seekers the right to work if their claims have not been processed within six months.  The 28-day cap was recently recommended by a cross-party group of MPs and peers.  Crossbench peer Lord Ramsbotham, a former HM inspector of prisons, put it forward as an amendment to the bill, saying he had done so because the current system "is not working".  He was backed by Labour and Lib Dem peers.  Recent inspections have found detainees being held for more than a year, and in two cases for as long as five years, at Verne IRC in Dorset and Harmondsworth IRC in west London - which is Europe's largest.  Meanwhile an inspection of Yarl's Wood IRC in Bedfordshire found almost 100 pregnant women among those been detained.  The report prompted Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick to say there should be "strict time limits" and vulnerable people should only be detained "in the most exceptional circumstances".  However, peers who supported the government in the debate warned that bringing in the 28-day cap could undermine the government's enforcement of immigration controls and make it more difficult to maintain public safety.  Lord Keen said the limit would give illegal migrants attempting to avoid being deported an "easy target" to aim for.  The change could lead to up to 10,000 people a year could appeal for release from detention, crossbench peer Lord Green of Deddington said.  Concerns were raised by several peers who opposed the amendment that it could lead to a deterioration of race relations - with released detainees potentially facing discrimination from land lords, and a return to the "bad old days of poor police race relations".  Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood, a crossbench peer, suggested a time limit of nine months would be better, pointing out that Sweden has a 12-month cut-off point.  But Labour peer Lord Rosser said the change would let the courts decide the issue.  Meanwhile, Lib Dem Lord Roberts of Llandudno said detainees should be treated with more compassion, because they are "not criminals, they are people... with lives and dreams".  Labour's Baroness Lister of Burtersett said indefinite detention impacted on people's mental health and the current situation was a "stain on this country's human rights record."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35810628	Investigatory Powers Bill: May defends surveillance powers	Home Secretary Theresa May has defended controversial new surveillance powers as MPs debated them for the first time.  The Investigatory Powers Bill will force the storage of internet browsing records for 12 months and authorise the bulk collection of personal data.  Mrs May said the measures were needed to keep the public safe and would uphold "both privacy and security".  Labour and the SNP said they backed the bill in principle but would withdraw support without substantial changes.  Labour's stance was branded "gutless" by the Lib Dems, who oppose the legislation.  The bill's second reading - where it was backed by 281 votes to 15 - gave MPs their first chance to debate it in the House of Commons. It represented an early step in a long parliamentary process which will see the details of the measures scrutinised at greater length over the coming months.  Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said Labour would work constructively with Mrs May to get the legislation through Parliament but that "substantial changes" were needed to ensure the right balance "between collective security and individual privacy in the digital age".  Labour abstained at second reading and will be seeking amendments including a specific "presumption of privacy".  "We need new legislation but this bill is not yet good enough," he said. "Simply to block this legislation would, in my view, be irresponsible. It would leave the police and security services in limbo... We must give them the tools to do the job."  The proposals have already been significantly amended after a draft bill last year was heavily criticised by three parliamentary committees.  The government may be forced to give further ground if it is to get the law on to the statute book by the end of the year as it wants, although it is not expected to meet significant resistance until the bill reaches report stage and then goes to the House of Lords.  Mr Burnham called for the use of surveillance powers to be limited to more serious investigations and for greater clarity on who can use them.  He said he did not see why agencies such as the Gambling Commission or the Food Standards Agency should have access to people's internet records, and said he would be calling on Mrs May to "severely reduce" the list of agencies who would get the new powers.  He also called for an independent review of "bulk powers" - the sweeping up of vast quantities of internet data and the collection of personal information from databases by the security services.  "I want a bill that helps the authorities do their job but protects ordinary people from intrusion and abuse from those in positions of power," he added.  Mrs May has said Britain's spies must continue to be allowed to hack into foreign computer networks, under so-called "bulk equipment interference warrants", as this was "a key operational requirement for GCHQ".  She told MPs that bulk powers had played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade, including seven terror plots foiled in the past 18 months, and in responding to the bulk of cyber attacks against UK interests.  Operational requests for such information, she said, would have to be approved by a judge as well as the minister responsible under a regime of "robust and consistent safeguards".  But Conservative MP Owen Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said elected politicians accountable to Parliament and the public should be exclusively responsible for granting warrants.  The SNP said they were in favour of "targeted surveillance" but many of the powers being sought were of "dubious legality".  "We will work with others to try and amend the bill extensively," Joanna Cherry, the party's home affairs spokeswoman, said. "If the bill is not amended to our satisfaction, we reserve the right to vote it down at a later stage."  The Lib Dems blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to legislate in this area, which was dubbed "the snoopers' charter", when they were part of the coalition government.  Speaking in the debate, former leader Nick Clegg said the bill was an improvement on previous proposals but was "not in a fit state" - telling MPs that it was still predicated on a "dragnet approach" to data retention and the powers it sought to grant were "formidable and capable of misuse".  "The implications of this are very big indeed," he said.  "It is that the government believes as a matter of principle that every innocent act of communication online must leave a trace for future possible interrogation by the state. No other country in the world feels the need to do this apart from Russia."  UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe told the BBC's Daily Politics he was "deeply concerned" by the Investigatory Powers Bill, saying it "could put us into an extreme position of monitoring our citizens".  Edward Snowden, the former CIA analyst turned surveillance whistleblower, said he was closely following Tuesday's debate. He tweeted: "Britons, note how your MPs vote today on IPBill. A vote in favour, or abstention, is a vote against you. "  And Amnesty International warned that "wide-ranging snooping powers" were being rushed through parliament at "break-neck speed".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35815332	Mind the NHS financial 'black hole'	Hospital trusts at "crisis point", a "huge challenge" to put the NHS on a firmer footing and a potential "black hole" in the finances. These were just some of the bleak conclusions of the Commons Public Accounts Committee on the financial state of the health service in England.  In one sense the findings were not surprising as the Committee was putting its own stamp on a previously published report by the National Audit Office. But the MPs zoned in on one particular aspect of NHS finances which has not had much of an airing - the feasibility of the planned annual £22 billion of efficiency savings which NHS England says must be achieved by 2020 to allow growth in patient demand to be satisfied.  That £22 billion was flagged up by Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, as part of a deal with ministers which would see more than £8 billion above inflation coming from the Government in 2020. But not much has been said since about how those savings might be achieved.  The Committee report says there is "not yet a convincing plan" for the £22 billion. Ministers and NHS leaders argue that "transformation" plans in local communities aimed at giving patients better care closer to home will keep them out of hospital and so save money. But the MPs are sceptical about whether this will generate anything like the required amount of savings.  Lord Carter, the Government's adviser on hospital productivity, believes that £5 billion can be found in 2020 partly by smarter procurement of supplies. But some close to the front line believe this is too optimistic. More savings will come from setting a cap on pay growth, but one senior source in hospital management says the idea that the full £22 billion can be conjured up is "fanciful".  Ministers argue, understandably, that health had a considerably more generous settlement in the spending review than most other departments. An extra £3.8 billion above inflation has been allocated for the financial year beginning in April as well as the promised higher funding in 2020.  A Department of Health spokesperson, responding to the parliamentary committee report, said : "We are intensively supporting challenged trusts to improve finances, while clamping down on rip off staffing agencies and helping hospitals become more efficient by sharing best practice across the service."  But sceptics in the leading hospitals argue that the funding increase for the 2016/17 financial year is enough simply to keep the show on the road. The extra annual allocations for the following few years, they argue, are not enough to keep up with the anticipated surge in patient demand. Extra cash has been pledged in recent weeks for mental health and maternity services and it is not clear how much is left over just to deal with the larger numbers of people needing hospital care.  And then there's the seven-day NHS issue. The Government wants to extend the range of weekend services in hospitals and GP practices in England by the time of the next election. Ministers acknowledge this pledge will come with a price tag. But the doubters ask where that money is coming from.  Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, has argued there are not enough doctors to fill vacancies now, let alone provide the more extensive range of weekend cover planned by the Government.  The Chancellor George Osborne, as he prepared to deliver his Budget, will probably feel exasperated that some in the NHS are calling for even more money so soon after what many hailed as a generous deal in the spending review. But the NHS has to deliver care to a rising and ageing population and questions are increasingly being asked across the service and in parliament about what that care will look like in 2020 on current spending plans.	health

The We Are The Reality Party fought three seats at the 2015 general election, with Bez gaining 703 votes in Salford and Eccles.  But the Electoral Commission said it failed to submit spending records and Bez - who is also party treasurer - ignored demands to pay an earlier fine.  The treasurer of a party formed by late union boss Bob Crow was also fined.  Bez, a former Celebrity Big Brother winner who found chart fame as a maraca-shaking dancer in the 1990s, was in trouble with the Electoral Commission before he had even officially launched his party in January last year.  He was forced to change its name after the watchdog ruled it sounded too similar to another group, The Realists' Party.  The rechristened We Are The Reality Party, which campaigned against fracking and austerity, is now under fire for failing to submit a campaign expenditure report and other paperwork required by law, including quarterly donations and loans reports.  In a statement, the Electoral Commission acknowledged Bez's party was "relatively small and does not have substantial resources".  But it added: "Despite the Commission's ongoing efforts to engage with the party it continues to fail to meet its statutory requirements. The level of the fine reflects this."  In a separate move, the treasurer of No2EU Yes to Democracy, Mary Bryce, has been fined £3,750 for non-compliance.  The now defunct party was set up by Bob Crow's RMT union, with backing from the Communist Party of Britain among others, to fight the 2009 European elections on an anti-EU, pro-workers rights platform.  It de-registered in 2010 when activists drifted away but was brought back for the 2014 European elections, when it fielded 46 candidates, including Mr Crow, who died of a heart attack two months before polling day.  The party was wound up again in October 2014 - but its treasurer failed to deliver a spending report for the 2014 election, despite appearing to "spend a substantial sum" and delivered donations and loans reports late, the Electoral Commission said.  The commission said it had chosen to fine the treasurer rather than the party because of the lack of co-operation specifically by the treasurer.  An initial fine of £3,000 has been increased to £3,750 and will go up to £4,500 if the fine is not paid by 31 March, it added.  Louise Edwards, Head of Regulatory Compliance and Casework at the Electoral Commission, said: "Transparency around party spending does not become less important because a party ceases to be registered.  "It remains the treasurer's legal responsibility to ensure all required reports have been delivered to the Commission.  "Despite our efforts, NO2EU's spending almost two years ago at the European Parliament Elections still remains unknown as a result of this lack of co-operation."	politics

The Transport Select Committee warned that police cuts would stop some offences being detected.  The number of specialist road policing officers in England and Wales fell from 7,104 to 4,356 between 2005 and 2014.  But the Home Office said the police had the resources they needed.  As the number of specialist road policing officers has fallen, there has been increasing use of technology to enforce traffic laws, the report said.  "For enforcement to be successful and for educational campaigns to be convincing there must be the likelihood that offenders will be apprehended.  "There is a growing concern that the lack of specialist dedicated road traffic officers means that 'minor' offences such as careless driving cannot be effectively detected and enforcement action taken."  The total number of offences detected on roads in England and Wales went from 4.3 million in 2004 to 1.5 million in 2014, the report said.  However, the number of offences resulting in a fatality - which will always be recorded - did not fall.  "This is significant as this suggests that the reduction in overall offences that are recorded does not represent a reduction in offences actually being committed," the report said.  Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the committee, said: "The fall in overall road offences does not reflect an improvement in driving."  The report said the government was right to focus on the "fatal four" - the main causes of road deaths - drink-driving, speeding, mobile phones and not wearing a seat belt.  It urged the Department for Transport to ensure detection rates for these offences were high, "whether through specialised road traffic police officers or by detection technology".  It recommended research into whether educational courses for poor driving had the required deterrent effect.  "By use of specialist officers, and appropriate use of technology, enforcement can be used alongside education which can make road users aware that serious driving offences will be detected," it added.  RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: "The sharp decline in roads policing officers appears to be having the very unwelcome effect of leading to fewer people being caught for illegal activity."  But the Home Office said: "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has been clear that there is no link between police resources and crime levels and effective roads policing is dependent on a range of factors, from better driver awareness to increased use of fixed penalty notices."  It said the enforcement of traffic offences was an operational matter for the police.	politics

Currently, the vaccine is routinely given only to infants in the UK.  The government's advisory committee says offering it to more children would not be cost effective for the NHS.  But campaigners say the cost out treating survivors outweighs the £75 vaccine price.  Nearly 823,000 people have signed a petition calling for the NHS immunisation programme to be widened.  It was set up by Gateshead father-of-two Lee Booth after one of his daughters was refused the vaccine on age grounds. It is now the most signed in parliamentary history.  He told the Petitions Committee meeting: "What price do you put on a child's life at the end of the day? We have got a vaccine out there. We should be using it."  The petition saw a spike in support after one mother, Jenny Burdett, publicly shared a photo of her young daughter dying from the infection.  Two-year-old Faye Burdett, from Kent, died in February, after an 11-day battle with meningitis B.  MPs on the Commons health and petitions committees will listen to evidence from interested parents, charities and government advisers, with a further session next Tuesday.  They include Faye's parents, Jenny and Neil, and former England rugby captain Matt Dawson, whose son survived meningitis.  She told the BBC: "Anybody can get meningitis B, not just babies. Mason was seven, adults can get it. It's important children are vaccinated against it. What price can you put on a child's life?  "We need to carry on the fight for all those children who have lost a life or suffered."  Meningitis B most often affects children aged under one and this is why experts say they chose this group to be routinely immunised - they wanted to protect those at highest risk.  The NHS programme started on 1 September, with the jab offered to infants at the age of two months, with a further dose at four months and a booster at 12 months. There was a one-off catch-up campaign for infants who narrowly missed out.  By May 2017, all UK children under the age of two years will have been offered it.  The vaccine is also available for a small number of older children and adults who are at increased risk of infection, such as those with no spleen.  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments, considered vaccinating older age groups (one to four-year-olds) but concluded it would not be cost-effective.  It also considered a programme for adolescents but said that further research was needed.  Dr Helen Bedford, senior lecturer in Children's Health at University College London, said the guideline on who should receive the jabs was not set in stone, but as the vaccine was rolled out across a generation of infants, experts would start to learn more about its overall effectiveness and its cost.  She said: "It's a hard decision, nobody wants to deny a child protection against this disease, which is devastating.  "We have got a limited pot of money in the NHS, you have to make decisions about where you are going to spend that money. Clearly, if you have a group that are so much more at risk than another group, that's where you are going to get the best value for that money."  A Department of Health spokesman said: "We understand people's concerns and all vaccination programmes are kept under constant review but we have to be guided by the very best scientific advice and we will continue to protect the children who are most at risk."  Charity Meningitis Now says there is enough evidence to support immunising children under five.  There are 12 known groups of meningococcal bacteria, and group B (meningitis B) is responsible for about 90% of meningococcal infections in the UK.  About 26% of these cases occur in the first year of life and 59% in children under the age of five.  Meningitis B is fatal in about one in 10 cases - and about one in four of those who survive is left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties.  Parents can pay privately for the vaccine, but there has been a shortage of supplies.	health

A spokeswoman said: "Vicki Kirby has been suspended from the Labour Party pending an investigation."  Ms Kirby was first suspended in 2014 for making anti-Semitic comments but later reinstated.  She was forced to stand down as an election candidate after tweets including one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God".  It emerged on Monday that since being reinstated Ms Kirby - whose Twitter account has been protected - is now vice-chair of the Labour constituency party in Woking, a development first reported by the Guido Fawkes website. It prompted an angry response from a number of Labour MPs on Twitter.  Following the fresh suspension, Labour MP Wes Streeting said it was "about time" Labour's ruling National Executive Committee had taken action.  He added: "I'm only sorry it has taken the intervention of scores of Labour MPs, party members ripping up membership cards and a police complaint to prompt it."  The BBC's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said that, although they would not confirm it, Labour's hand may have been forced by a complaint to Surrey Police by Kevin McKeever, who is a Labour candidate to be police and crime commissioner in Northamptonshire.  Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham told the BBC's Daily Politics: "From what I have seen, the comments are completely abhorrent."  Ex-minister Angela Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One there was "accumulating evidence" that there was a problem in the party and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn "could do more" to emphasise that there was "no place" for anti-Semitism and to "stamp it out".  She rejected suggestions that the issue was being used by critics of Mr Corbyn to undermine his leadership.  Ms Kirby's latest suspension comes in the wake of the recent expulsion of a far-left activist, Gerry Downing, following criticism of his views about 9/11 and so-called Islamic State.	politics

Let's hope the journos/Westminster do same."  So tweeted novelist Sandra Howard, when husband Michael, the former Conservative leader, signed up to the Leave campaign.  But will everybody find it as easy to preserve domestic harmony in the run up to the EU referendum on 23 June?  Referendums are strange things. Unlike party politics, where you tend to know where your other half stands, they can throw up surprising opinions and previously buried viewpoints.  How did you live with someone for this long without knowing they were a raving Europhile/Eurosceptic?  The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was famous for causing family rifts. Stuart Valentine, chief executive of counselling service Relationship Scotland, says some of these wounds have yet to heal.  He does not expect the EU referendum to stir the same passions but, he adds, many of the couples he sees have problems with each other's "world view", particularly if it has changed over time.  It normally surfaces in disagreements over how to bring up the children, says Mr Valentine, but political opinions can be thrown in to the mix too.  "Not belittling someone for holding a different view is really important," he says. "Try to show respect and be civil to each other."  That may be easier said than done, perhaps. Particularly if you have a killer fact that you know will settle the argument once and for all.  But none of this applies to the 20% or more of the population who have yet to make up their mind, including, it turns out, one-time TV power couple Richard and Judy.  "On the whole, Richard leans towards the outies, while I drift towards the innies," wrote Judy Finnigan, in the couple's Daily Express column.  "I don't like the EU but the innate caution that so often goes with motherhood is making me worry about the consequences of leaving in terms of the economy and defence. Richard is braver and more robust than me."  The idea that men are braver, more decisive characters will not ring true in many households.  But the referendum campaign has been a curiously masculine affair so far, according to Deborah Mattinson, of pollsters Britain Thinks, and it is making women angry.  "We know that women are undecided about the EU referendum," she writes.  "They're less likely than men to express certainty on a whole range of issues.  "Crucially though, they're no less likely to vote - in fact there are more women voters than men. So there are millions of women's votes potentially up for grabs in the referendum.  "It's remarkable that the two campaigns aren't making more effort to go after them."  Both sides need to become more "human" and stop bellowing at each other about statistics, advises the former New Labour guru.  It's not just couples that find themselves on different sides of the great referendum debate. The fault lines can run through families too.  Just look at the Johnson clan. Boris is an outer. His wife Marina may also be, judging by this article setting out her doubts about the wisdom of remaining in.  But father Stanley, a former member of the European Parliament, and brothers Jo, a Conservative science minister, and Leo, a sustainability expert, are inners. Boris Johnson's mother Charlotte, a painter, was an inner but has been converted to an outer.  We know all this because the London Mayor's sister, Rachel Johnson (an inner), gave us an account of her brother's anguish as he inched towards declaring his position, in a piece for the Daily Mail.  It has not split the family, she stresses. Despite what everyone assumes.  Arabella Russell, a counsellor with Relate, advises couples not to shy away from airing their political differences.  "Some people feel quite fearful that their partner might have different views to them," she says, "They think 'these are my values and beliefs and I think my partner should share them'."  In her work with couples, Ms Russell advises them that they do not have to be the same person. She thinks debates about political issues like the EU can be an "opportunity for growth," provided you keep it civil, of course.  "Try to talk very honestly and openly about why you find someone else's opinions difficult," she says.  We'll leave the final word to Sandra Howard, who takes to the ping pong table when husband Michael refuses to budge on the EU issue.  "Trouble is he always wins - at table tennis..."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35779006	Not enough doctors for 7-day NHS, says Royal College head	There are not enough doctors to run a seven-day NHS in England, according to a leading doctor.  In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work.  She will highlight research that shows vacant posts are not being filled and gaps in rotas are being seen.  It comes as ministers are locked in a dispute with junior doctors over their plans for improving weekend care.  Last week thousands of medics went on strike over the government's decision to impose a new contract on them, designed to make it cheaper to rota on staff at weekends.  Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands.  Physicians are doctors who focus on diagnosis and treatment as opposed to surgery. They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly.  Research by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants.  But four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas.  Meanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed.  Prof Dacre will tell delegates: "I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them.  "If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?"  She will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany.  "It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare," she will say.  But a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - £8bn more by 2020.  She said this would help "make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week".	health

Volunteers who used this approach were 25% more likely to remain abstinent half a year from the date that they give up than smokers who tried to gradually wean themselves off instead.  The NHS says that picking a convenient date to quit is important.  Make a promise, set a date and stick to it, it advises.  And sticking to the "not a drag" rule can really help too.  "Whenever you find yourself in difficulty say to yourself, 'I will not have even a single drag' and stick with this until the cravings pass," the service says.  In the British Heart Foundation-funded study, nearly 700 UK volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups - a gradual quit group or an immediate quit group.  After six months, 15.5% of the participants in the gradual-cessation group were abstinent compared with 22% in the abrupt-cessation group.  Lead researcher Dr Nicola Lindson-Hawley, from Oxford University, said: "The difference in quit attempts seemed to arise because people struggled to cut down. It provided them with an extra thing to do, which may have put them off quitting altogether."  Even though more people in the study said they preferred the idea of quitting gradually than abruptly, individuals were still more likely to stop for good in the abrupt group.  Dr Lindson-Hawley said that it was still better to cut down on cigarettes than do nothing at all.  All of the people in her study were also offered advice and support and access to nicotine patches and replacement therapy, like nicotine gum or mouth spray. These services are available for free on the NHS.	health

Indeed, closing the gap between what the government spends and what it takes in taxes was the government's main mission.  But it has proved harder than Mr Osborne had hoped. He would blame circumstances beyond his control which - again - threaten to push his targets further back.  His critics on one side would say the initial pace of the cuts are what dragged the recovery down - a self-defeating object.  Critics on the right would say in fact he's lacked the courage to go far enough.  In the febrile atmosphere less than 48 hours before a Budget, there is agreement on one thing - whether fast or slow, the most straightforward cuts, practically and politically, have gone.  Former head of the Home Civil Service Lord Kerslake, who was until recently one of the most senior officials involved in the hunt for savings, says clearly: "It's hard to see where the easy choices are now."  He told me: "The savings that have to be found will require very substantial changes in the way things are delivered - or, indeed, the offer made."  In other words, public services will have to be delivered much more cheaply, or the public will have to accept very different levels of provision.  And with Mr Osborne significantly behind on his own original targets from 2010, by accident or design, Lord Kerslake told me: "We've still got some way to go, no more than half on the numbers.  "The important thing to say is that the second half is much harder because the sense of crisis that drove the savings in the coalition government has ebbed, the wider economy is growing so people can't see a comparable position there and people just get exhausted by the process.  "The easy savings have been done. So where do you go?"  Well, the chancellor is likely to announce further squeezes on welfare spending - the government has already outlined taking another billion out of the budget allocated to disabled people.  There are likely, by 2020, to be cuts of an extra £4bn a year by 2020. To raise revenue, there could possibly be a rise in fuel tax - politically difficult but lucrative for the government coffers - maybe hikes in insurance premiums, and what one Tory MP described as "nibbles here and there".  With the European referendum bearing down on Numbers 10 and 11 there is a desire not to stir up too much controversy, not to distract too much from their main task in hand.  But as Lord Kerslake warns, taking anything else out of government budgets that have already been slimmed down is tricky - a task almost bound to cause complaint in itself.	politics

The party adopted a motion - which also allows for all-women shortlists - at its spring conference at the weekend.  The voluntary measure aims to boost diversity amongst candidates and MPs.  Lib Dem president Baroness Brinton told the BBC it was "ridiculous" that there were "only a handful" of disabled people in Parliament.  She told BBC Radio 5 Live the Lib Dems were offering "a full range of support" for candidates for under-represented groups.  Rejecting the charge that it was tokenistic, she said: "We've tried support and mentoring for candidates from these under-represented groups and it's just not working."  Part of the problem, she said, was that people - whether members or the electorate - often "can't see beyond the wheelchair or the British Sign Language interpreter".  "Their view of an MP is not somebody in a wheelchair and that is really, really frustrating," she added.  It was vital therefore to persuade the public that disabled parliamentarians "have done a very good job", she said.  The party will try the format in the run up to the 2020 general election - and would try to encourage take-up by proposing spaces on the shortlists of "winnable seats".  "We're going to get the best of our candidates together and where a seat is happy to support it we're going to actually have a contest that makes sure we have a brilliant disabled candidate ready to go for a winnable seat in Parliament," she said.  In addition, Lady Brinton explained, the party will be asking local parties in the "top seats" to declare who they have approached - for example women, disabled people, black and ethnic minority and LGBT candidates - before starting the selection process.  "We think that's going to be a real culture change, from the grassroots up," Baroness Brinton said.  At the 2015 general election the Lib Dems were reduced from 57 to eight MPs, all of whom are white males, aged between 45 and 67.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34484687	The battle to be the official EU referendum Leave campaign	A referendum will be held on 23 June on whether the UK will remain a member of the European Union or not. Here's a guide to the two groups currently battling to become the official Leave campaign.  The two main campaigns are Vote Leave and Leave.EU/Grassroots Out.  This group was launched on 9 October 2015, and comprises a cross-party group of MPs and peers from the Conservatives, Labour, UKIP and other parties.  It is funded by people of different party affiliations including City millionaire and Tory donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills and Stuart Wheeler, a Tory-turned-UKIP donor.  Vote Leave is being run by Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group founder Matthew Elliot, who organised the successful 'No2AV' campaign in the referendum on reform of the Westminster voting system, and Dominic Cummings, a former aide to Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove.  The group is being backed by Mr Gove, who is co-chairing its campaign committee, as well as four other members of David Cameron's Cabinet who are backing EU exit, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Chris Grayling and John Whittingdale.  Mayor of London Boris Johnson is another key figure. The group hopes he can win over undecided Conservatives and reach others - including younger voters - with his particular brand of campaigning.  Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, has broken ranks with his party leader to support the group as has the party's former deputy chair Suzanne Evans. Also on board is Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the Democratic Unionists Party.  Leave.EU was initially called The Know and rebranded when an amended referendum question was proposed. Founded by UKIP donor Arron Banks, it was backed by leader Nigel Farage, who billed it as an "umbrella group" of anti-EU campaigners.  Mr Farage and Leave.EU have since become part of the Grassroots Out Movement after its launch in January. The cross-party group is also being backed by Labour MP Kate Hoey as well as ex-Conservative ministers Liam Fox and David Davis, among other politicians.  Also backing GO is former Respect MP George Galloway and DUP MP Sammy Wilson.  It is holding a series of events across the country to try and mobilise support, setting up stalls in 500 locations on a single day. It says its goal is to bring together existing leave campaigns and get them to work as one in local areas.  Leave.EU and Grassroots Out have effectively merged for the purpose of trying to secure the official lead campaign status for the Out side.  It will be up to the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, to designate which of the groups will become the official Leave campaign. The process has begun, with a decision due by the middle of April.  The Electoral Commission will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity.  The chosen group (as well as the official In campaign) will benefit from increased spending limits of £7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts and a free mail-out to households. They all get access to public meeting rooms and to the electoral register, and are entitled to public grants of up to £600,000.  Six months ago, there was talk that the two groups would inevitably end up co-operating with each other and potentially even merging.  But relations between the two sides soured amid arguments over their strategies. Efforts at bridge-building have come to nothing.  Mr Farage has said Vote Leave is making "Westminster-based" business arguments and that only Leave.EU/Grassroots Out will be able to reach outside to wider audiences. Leave.EU has said its rival was "run by the Westminster bubble".  But Mr Carswell has suggested it was a "one-horse race" in favour of Vote Leave to become the official campaign, and dismissed the level of support for Leave.EU, saying: "Getting a whole bunch of likes on Facebook is not the same as winning a referendum."  Unlike the In campaign, which is clearly being led by David Cameron, the Out campaign has not settled on a single figurehead.  This may not happen, with the possibility of key figures such as Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Conservative employment minister Priti Patel being deployed in rotation to make different arguments and appeal to separate groups.  Much will depend on which campaign group wins the official designation and whether there is a head-to-head TV debate during the campaign. This is not guaranteed and both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have apparently ruled out taking on the prime minister face-to-face.  Nigel Farage's role is likely to attract much attention. He has insisted he does not want to lead the official campaign, with some Eurosceptics thinking he would be too divisive a figure to fill that role. He has however said UKIP will "take the lead" in the Out campaign.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35801294	Budget 2016: George Osborne's political balancing act	Like Sherlock Holmes, we must look in this Budget for the dogs that do not bark. Four years out from a general election, this is the time in the political cycle when chancellors can take unpopular decisions. A moment, perhaps, for a big reform to our pensions or taxation. Yet the mood music emerging from the Treasury is distinctly adagio.  For George Osborne finds himself constrained by the EU referendum, a restive Tory party, a sluggish global economy and leadership ambitions that are not without challenge.  The chancellor does not wish to anger the electorate unduly with significant tax rises just a few months before asking them to vote on Britain's membership of the EU.  He does not wish to test the patience of fractious Conservative MPs, many of whom would be more than happy to turn the Budget-enacting Finance Bill into a cause celebre for the EU exit cause.  He does not wish to make bold decisions that might look risky as the global economy stutters. And he does not wish to take decisions that might endanger his hopes of succeeding David Cameron.  Thus the political and economic parameters of this Budget - which, as a result, will be more cautious than it might have been.  Genuinely radical plans to overhaul pension tax relief have been put on hold for fear of upsetting middle and higher earners. Proposals to cut the 45p top rate of tax are said to have gone the same way.  There has been no significant announcement trailed in the Sunday newspapers. And Mr Osborne's pre-Budget set-piece interview on Sunday with Andrew Marr was notable more for the chancellor's thinly disguised gibes at his rival Boris Johnson than anything he had to say about this week's financial statement.  And yet this Budget cannot and will not be entirely without substance. There are some things Mr Osborne cannot put off for another day. Above all, he has to act to ensure that he will meet his target of achieving a surplus by 2019/20. This is a commitment that now has force of law.  Under the latest figures, published in the autumn, the chancellor will narrowly meet his target by a mere £10bn. The independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility is expected to say that the British economy is smaller than the watchdog had expected it would be when it made that prediction. As such, the Treasury would get less than it had expected in tax revenues.  So that means Mr Osborne will have to consider either more spending cuts or tax rises. He told Andrew Marr he was planning a further £4bn of cuts, although some of these might be delayed until later in this Parliament. This will not be easy. He appears to have ruled out cutting pension tax relief. So he is looking at squeezing some disability benefits and taking a scythe to Whitehall once again.  The chancellor will also have to raise a few taxes. Increasing fuel duty would provoke squeals from Tory MPs. But if he cannot raise fuel duty when oil prices are as low as they are now then he will never do so. It is worth noting that the Tory manifesto in 2015 did not rule out raising fuel duty.  Mr Osborne could also raise insurance premium tax again, slyly making us all pay more to insure our cars and houses. He might see if he can cut some relief on employers' pension contributions. And he will raise a few million pounds by clamping down on people using so-called personal service companies to cut their income tax bills.  His task is to come up with enough tax increases to raise some decent cash without scaring his MPs so much that he faces possible defeat in the House of Commons where, we must never forget, the government has but a small majority.  For as well as making cuts to keep his deficit target on track, Mr Osborne also needs to act to keep his leadership hopes on track. He has been bruised by a string of recent set backs over tax credit cuts, Sunday trading rules and Google's modest tax bill.  Mr Osborne will want to use his Budget to restore some gloss to a reputation that has dulled in the eyes of many Tory MPs. So some tax cuts are expected, particularly to income tax thresholds and rates, to rally the Tory back benches. Those same MPs will also want to see Mr Osborne score some points against Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour leader makes his first response to a Budget, perhaps the hardest gig in British politics.  So these are constraints around which Mr Osborne has to operate this week. The biggest shadow is cast by the referendum campaign.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35796861	Budget 2016: George Osborne warns of cuts of 50p per £100	Chancellor George Osborne has warned the UK has to "act now rather than pay later" ahead of next week's Budget, with further spending cuts planned.  He said the cuts would be "equivalent to 50p in every £100" of public spending by 2020, which was "not a huge amount in the scheme of things".  He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the world was "more uncertain" than at any time since the financial crisis.  He said the UK needed to live within its means to withstand economic shocks.  Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment to enable the UK economy to "withstand the global headwinds".  Mr Osborne warned of cuts to come in his upcoming Budget on 16 March in a BBC interview last month.  Speaking on the Marr Show, Mr Osborne said the world was now "a more difficult and dangerous place" and warned about the state of the global economy.  While Britain was better placed to cope with economic shocks compared with 2008, it was "not immune to what's going on", he said.  "My message in this Budget is that the world is a more uncertain place than at any time since the financial crisis and we need to act now so we don't pay later," he said.  "That is why I need to find additional savings equivalent to 50p in every £100 the government spends by the end of the decade, because we've got to live within our means to stay secure.  "That's the way we make Britain fit for the future."  The chancellor - whose Budget on Wednesday will be his eighth - said he thought the savings were achievable, but he would not be drawn on where the axe would fall.  He said the government's plan had enabled it to invest in "the public's priorities", such as the NHS, science and education, infrastructure and defence, "while at the same time not spending more than the country can afford".  Mr Osborne added that he wanted to boost productivity, improve Britain's schools and infrastructure and make taxes "more competitive".  The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether fuel duty would be increased - something Tory backbenchers are urging him against.  But he added: "On fuel duty, we had a manifesto commitment there and we have pencilled in fuel duty plans going forward but what I would say is, every time we can have our economy more competitive, we do."  Mr Osborne also rejected claims that the most vulnerable people would be hit in the Budget through cuts to disability benefits known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP).  He said the government was "increasing spending on disabled people", but added that it was right to make sure the system was being "properly managed".  Also on Marr, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment in the UK economy, specifically in skills, infrastructure and new technology.  He said the chancellor had reduced investment to 1.4% of GDP which was "unacceptable", saying the OECD has said the figure should be at least 3%.  "What I want to do is to make sure we invest in the long term and then we can withstand the global headwinds," he added.  He said prosperity needed to be "shared by all", saying the government's economic policies had created an "unequal" society.  The chancellor has promised to get the books into surplus by 2020.  In his November Autumn Statement, he watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments. He was able to do this owing to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.  BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said: "Only four months ago, when he made the Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne had sounded upbeat about the country's finances.  "But now, with the size of the British economy much smaller than had been expected, it seems the chancellor has not left himself much wriggle room."  In his Marr interview, Mr Osborne also warned against the UK leaving the EU, saying it "would create an economic shock" that would "cost jobs" and "damage living standards".  Leave campaigners say the UK could strike favourable trade deals with the EU after exit, arguing that Britain's future if better off outside.  Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell said he and the Labour shadow cabinet would be "on the stomp" campaigning for a remain vote amid criticism Labour has been quiet in the campaign.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35797033	Labour: Tom Watson urges 'calm' over leadership speculation	Labour's deputy leader has urged politicians across his party to "calm down", amid speculation about a possible leadership challenge.  Tom Watson told Sky News those who had elected Jeremy Corbyn "on a very large mandate" last September would not want to see him challenged months later.  "I hope that those MPs on all sides of this argument will pay heed to that," he said.  Recent reports say some Labour MPs are now set on trying to oust Mr Corbyn.  Two days ago, BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said a minority of MPs seemed more determined than ever to mount a challenge soon.  Our correspondent said tension in the party is heightening ahead of elections in May in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities, with Mr Corbyn's allies and critics each staking out their positions.  Labour's deputy leader said: "This is the great irony of politics in that there are people in the party who are trying to change the rules in order to try and protect Jeremy's position and they might just be precipitating a challenge to his leadership.  "Of course that's just not common sense and I hope those people who are holding those different point of views can calm down a bit.  In other comments, Mr Watson said he was "incredibly disappointed... and I know Jeremy is too" by Ken Livingstone's recent remarks that a hedge fund manager donating to Labour MP Dan Jarvis was like "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group".  "That was very unhelpful because what we're trying to do is make sure that all our members and our MPs stick to talking about policies and issues and don't slug it out with personal insults," Mr Watson said.  Mr Jarvis, whom some commentators see as a future Labour leader, has not responded to Mr Livingstone publically.  The hedge fund donor, Martin Taylor, said the former London mayor's remarks were "inflammatory and unfounded".	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35780468	Is fermented food a recipe for good gut health?	Fermentation as a way of preserving food dates back thousands of years, but it is now being held up as a potentially important source of friendly, health-giving bacteria. So should we all be eating sauerkraut and kimchi?  Allowing bacteria to form in a sealed jar of vegetables over a few months might not seem like the most appealing way to create an appetising dish, but fermentation has a lot going for it.  Just ask the Koreans and Japanese, who have been fermenting vegetables, fish and beans for generations.  When the Korean cabbage dish kimchi is made using traditional methods, cabbage is soaked in salt water to kill off any harmful bacteria.  In the next stage, the remaining bacteria, called Lactobacillus, convert sugars and carbohydrate into lactic acid, which preserves the vegetables and gives them a tangy flavour that many people love.  This type of bacteria is not the enemy - it is actually good for our digestion and for our health. We need it in our guts to fight off the harmful bacteria, restore the balance of our immune system and help the body to work at its best.  These "good bacteria" are called probiotics, which literally means "for life", because of the job they do.  But are there enough of them in fermented food to make a difference?  Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and author of The Diet Myth - The Real Science Behind What We Eat, says it is a complicated picture.  "There are many fermented foods out there and not many have had formal testing so it's difficult to know what they do," he says.  "But there's nothing harmful about them if they are produced naturally, rather than using vinegar."  Fermented food comes in many forms, for example, yoghurt, sour cream, sour dough bread, vegetables, chutneys and pickles. Often probiotics are added, in the form of live bacteria or yeast, if the foods are not made using lactic acid bacteria as in kimchi.  Even wine and beer can be included on the fermented list, but they are not all beneficial to the same degree - and so they cannot all be classed as healthy.  The most important consideration is whether the good bacteria can survive all the way through the gut to the bowel and the colon where they have a chance to be of benefit.  Studies suggest this is not guaranteed and that probiotics would have to be eaten regularly and in quite large numbers to survive the journey.  If and when they manage to breed in the gut, scientists have a theory about the role they perform.  "We think they can allow production of chemicals called short-chain fatty acids, which improve the immune system, by keeping it balanced and stopping it over-reacting," says Prof Spector.  A great deal of research is being carried out to find out if taking probiotics can improve the health of people with specific disorders.  So far it has been suggested there could be benefits for those with irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory diseases of the intestines. They may also improve allergies in babies and the health of people with weak immune systems.  But Prof Spector says that while studies on the effect of probiotics on animals in the lab are convincing, research on humans is still lacking.  The very sick, the very young and the very old are mostly likely to benefit from probiotics if their guts are weakened, but as yet there is little evidence they do much for a healthy person.  Instead, the key may be to focus on prebiotics, which feed the beneficial bacteria in our guts, nurturing them and helping them to grow.  This is an area Dr Gemma Walton, a gut microbiologist from Reading University, has been investigating and she has found encouraging evidence that a prebiotic diet can increase the numbers of good bacteria in the gut.  She said mothers' breast milk was a good example of a prebiotic because it supported the growth of health-promoting bacteria.  Bananas are another prebiotic, but Dr Walton says: "You would need to eat 10 bananas a day to get enough of the compound."  Onions, asparagus, chicory and garlic act as prebiotics too.  Sauerkraut (cabbage), yoghurt, kimchi and miso soup are just some of the fermented food products which contain the live microbes needed to keep the good bacteria alive for longer.  However, Dr Walton says it is difficult to know which fermented foods will hit the spot.  "All foods have a different mix of bacteria which means some will be more beneficial than others," she says, before adding that bacterial ingredients in food products were often unclear.  There are trillions of bacteria living in our guts and on our bodies - more than 10 times the number of body cells in one individual.  "If we can help to get more fibres down there in the gut then it's a good thing," she adds.  The answer to all this may be found in British Gut Project, which is analysing the gut bacteria of 2,000 people. The aim is to find out which species of bacteria exist in the gut and which groups in the population have the most species in their bodies.  Ultimately, researchers will be able to answer the question of whether there is such a thing as a perfectly healthy gut - and what feeds it.  The plan is then to compare national gut bacteria to find out which country has the healthiest diet.  Asian diets, which have a tradition of fermented foods, appear to lead to better gut health in countries such as China, Japan and Korea, where bowel diseases are less common.  So it would be no surprise if Western diets, which are dominated by sugar and processed food, are in need of more probiotics to top up the gut's bacterial swamp.  In the meantime, Prof Spector suggests eating a variety of things you like.  "A bit of fruit and natural yoghurt for breakfast perhaps, try kefir, sauerkraut, miso soup, kimchi..." he says.	health

The government says the reforms will ensure those most in need receive help, and save more than a billion pounds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35793004	Disability benefit change to affect half a million	More than half a million disabled people could lose out as a result of further changes over the next four years to welfare payments.  The formula the government uses to calculate the daily living component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for disabled people will change in January.  The government said 640,000 people could be affected by this by 2020.  It said it would save £1.2bn and ensure PIP was fairer, but disability charities criticised the move.  Recipients of PIP are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive.  Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.  An independent review found that the assessment criteria "may not be working as planned" and a subsequent review found a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal-to-no ongoing daily living extra costs, the Department for Work and Pensions said.  It said many of the aids and appliances for which points were awarded were likely already to be found in people's homes.  So the weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  The minister for disabled people, Justin Tomlinson, said: "Many people are eligible for a weekly award despite having minimal to no extra costs and judicial decisions have expanded the criteria for aids and appliances to include items we would expect people to have in their homes already.  "This new change will ensure that PIP is fairer and targets support at those who need it most."  The Department for Work and Pensions said that over the last six months there had been three legal judgements that had ruled a bed or chair could be classed as an aid or appliance if it helped someone get dressed or undressed.  But Disability Rights UK told the BBC that what it called the "cumulative affect" of cuts to both benefits and social care was eroding the capacity for some disabled people to live independently.  Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said the changes would make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit.  "It is crucial that the PIP assessment accurately reflects the extra costs disabled people face," he said.  "Buying specialist equipment, adaptations and other aids are significant and ongoing extra costs for many disabled people."  And Labour's shadow minister for disabled people Debbie Abrahams said that the Conservative Party was "yet again ignoring the views of disabled people, carers and experts in the field".  And Dame Anne Begg, former chairwoman of the work and pensions committee and a wheelchair user, felt the changes were part of a government tactic to reduce overall the number of disability benefit claimants.  She told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "They've started at the wrong end - rather than looking at what people needed and the money they should get to cover the extra costs of disability, they've decided they wanted half a million less claimants.  "They've obviously drawn up the original criteria and discovered they're not cutting out as many people as they anticipated.  She acknowledged cutting a weekly benefit to cover a sometimes one-off payment "sounded sensible" but added: "These things, like needing a seat to sit down in the shower, act as a proxy because that probably also means you're unable to do some household chores... none of which are measureable under the present system.  "They're tightening these descriptors to make sure fewer people get the benefit."  A second independent review of PIP is due by April 2017.  Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

In a letter to the chancellor, they say hospitals in England are unable to discharge those patients who are ready to leave.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35785848	Doctors urge chancellor to increase social care funding	Fourteen doctors' leaders have written to George Osborne asking for further funding for social care in next week's Budget.  In a letter to the chancellor, they said cuts in social care funding were putting real pressure on the NHS.  And they said investing in social care was "vital to the success of the NHS".  The government said it was already giving local authorities access to up to £3.5bn of new funding for adult social care by 2019-20.  The signatories to the letter are led by Clare Marx, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and include the leaders of a number of royal medical colleges and societies.  In their letter to the chancellor, they describe health and social care as "two sides of the same coin".  The letter describes the impact of an underfunded social care system on the NHS, saying patients fit to be discharged are unable to leave hospital because social support is unavailable at home.  This increases the likelihood of infections and falls, they write.  The knock-on effect is that beds are blocked to new patients, they continue, "leading to cancelled appointments and operations".  "This impacts on our ability to provide timely treatment and meet treatment targets, risking patient wellbeing, and is ultimately detrimental to the economy through delayed returns to work," they wrote.  The doctors also said the plans for social care funding contained in the comprehensive spending review "will not suffice".  In the letter, they suggest bringing forward the extra £700m from the Better Care Fund to this year rather than waiting until 2017, when the money was due to be spread over three years.  NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has previously said that the success of the Five Year Forward View is dependent on adequate funding for social care.  A spokesman for the Department of Health said it was essential that older and vulnerable people got the care they deserved.  "That's why we have given local authorities access to up to £3.5bn to spend on social care and councils will have almost £200 billion to spend on local services over the lifetime of this parliament."  The signatories to the letter are:  Miss Clare Marx, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England  Prof Dame Sue Bailey, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges  Prof John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health  Dr Anna Batchelor, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine  Dr Liam Brennan, president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists  Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians  Mr Michael Lavelle-Jones, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh  Dr Suzy Lishman, president of the Royal College of Pathologists  Prof Carrie MacEwen, president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists  Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists  Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health  Dr David Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists  Prof Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists	health

He told BBC Newsnight: "In recent weeks, when I've spoken up about this issue, I felt extremely pressured to be silent on the things I know to be true."  The Labour Party said any complaints or evidence of sexism or intimidation were dealt with fairly.  Mr Shuker raised his concerns in response to claims made by the charity Muslim Women's Network UK (MWN UK) concerning the "blocking" of vocal, independent Muslim women by male members of the Labour Party who are of Pakistani heritage.  MWN UK has called for an inquiry by the party into "systematic misogyny" within Labour.  Mr Shuker says: "I've been disappointed with the response of the Labour Party.  "I would like robust action from the leadership - both from the NEC and from the leader of the Labour Party to say 'If there are these practices, we will take time to root them out.'  "When people come forward with legitimate concerns, they should be backed, not silenced.  "This is not just a moral imperative; it's an electoral imperative. We can't carry on treating the Muslim community as fools - we need to serve up great candidates at every single level. The community knows when there are abuses of power."  Since its calls for an inquiry, MWN UK says it has heard of "sinister elements" within the party that leave women "fearing for their lives".  One Asian woman, a former Labour councillor, agreed to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight as long as her identity was kept hidden. She claimed Pakistani-heritage councillors on the English council where she served, who are still sitting councillors, regularly protect corrupt Asian businessmen.  On one occasion, "Zahara" says, the police presented councillors with a sexually explicit video as they ruled on whether to shut down a club.  She told Newsnight: "The decision ultimately should have been to close the establishment down because of inappropriate behaviours going on of a sexual nature between young white girls and Asian males that was being shown on the video.  "I was clearly told to stop questioning by a hand gesture and nudge by senior male councillors that were Asian who were sitting next to me… I was told: 'Do you know who it is? It's a very prominent Asian businessman that supports us'."  This woman claims that, on this occasion and many others, because she refused to do as these powerful councillors of Pakistani heritage demanded, they got her deselected.  When she arrived at the selection meeting, it was full of Asian people she had never seen before. "They're in the pocket of influential male councillors," she recalls.  "They were told to be there… and to vote a certain way. There were two or three young Asian males who found the courage to call me and say 'It's an absolute travesty, what happened.' I sent letters of complaint to the regional office and to head office of Labour and I was told there was no case to answer."  In some cases, the Labour Party has put individual wards into "special measures". That effectively means the selection process is taken out of local hands.  That has happened in Oldham where Arooj Shah is a councillor, though there is still resistance from some Labour members in her predominately Asian area, to a Muslim woman representing them  Cllr Shah says: "There's Labour Party members who will accept my two colleagues, Asian men, but support anyone but me. They're members of the local Labour party. They are shameless about it… It's because I'm a woman and anyone who sugar-coats it is lying."  Her ward colleagues are Muslim men and get far bigger majorities than she does. One, Cllr Shadab Qumer, described conversations he's had with local Labour members: "Some of them come up with derogatory comments, like 'Oh, she's a Muslim woman. She shouldn't be representing us.'  "Some of us have dragged them onside. We've got to integrate; where in Islam does it say a female can't represent us? It's a cultural thing, we've fought it."  Newsnight has spoken to other women who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. Many talked of clan politics perpetrated by these patriarchal communities, the so-called "biraderi", imported from the south Asian subcontinent, in which votes are delivered in blocks.  Many said threats and intimidation were used to force them out of politics.  One woman said: "I was standing to be a councillor and the big man of the Asian councillors came to my house to convince my husband to get me to stop down. It was frightening… They were threatening and scaring my family into getting me to step aside."  Another said: "I complained to Labour branch but they sided with the men. These men told them they would get more votes and members for them. My life was made hell after the complaint. The aggression was too much to bear.  "I'm a single mum and was worried about my daughter's safety. These men were capable of anything. In the end, I was deselected, despite all my commitment to the party."  Another ex-councillor explained how she was ousted: "I've no doubt I was deselected by Pakistani clan politics. There were around 100 people in the room. One of the local councillors had been recruiting family and friends to deselect me."  Muslim Women's Network UK (MWN UK) has written again to Jeremy Corbyn, saying it is "disappointed and unsatisfied" with Labour's response to the charity's calls for an inquiry.  In the letter, MWN UK says: "It would appear that our complaint is being tagged on to an existing Labour Party agenda item, and therefore that it is not being taken seriously and given the attention it deserves.  "The standard, lacklustre nature of the response received from the Labour Party is disappointing and undermines the women who have been brave enough to come forward and share their experiences.  "Such a response will not give women the confidence to come forward and speak to Labour Party officials in future."  MWN UK's Shaista Gohir told Newsnight: "What's worrying, these men have become a law unto themselves. That can't be in a vacuum, it's been going on for decades. Muslim men are saying to us 'We're glad you are saying what we've all known about. It just gets brushed under the carpet by senior Labour officials.'"  The Labour Party said it had been "at the forefront of the fight for women's equality".  It added: "We have transformed the representation of women in politics and championed equality for women in the workplace.  "Any complaints or evidence of sexism, intimidation, received by the Labour Party are dealt with fairly, according to our procedures and the law.  "Labour Party elected representatives are expected to maintain the highest standards of behaviour and conduct at all times.  "Any allegations of individual elected representatives whose behaviour falls short of that should be reported to the Labour Party or the appropriate authorities."

The former London Mayor told BBC News Dan Jarvis's acceptance of the cash showed he was not "genuinely Labour".  The Savile comment was branded "disgusting" by one Labour MP - and former home secretary Alan Johnson said he should "keep his trap shut".  Mr Jarvis, who is tipped as a future Labour leader, has yet to respond.  Mr Livingstone told BBC News: "All hedge fund managers want is to know that they're going to have a prime minister who's going to allow them to continue to evade tax and it's totally unacceptable for hedge fund managers to be contributing to anyone in the Labour Party.  "No-one in the Labour party who's genuinely Labour would want to take a penny from them."  Pressed on his choice of analogy, he said: "It's meant to be deliberately provocative because I'm saying to Dan Jarvis if you want to be a serious player in the Labour party, don't mix with these people, they're sick."  Mr Livingstone made the Savile comment in an interview with LBC Radio, after Mr Jarvis made a speech setting out his vision for returning Labour to power.  He said there is an "embittered group of old Blairites who are looking for someone to challenge Jeremy" and they think Dan Jarvis is "someone credible to run".  Alan Johnson has described Mr Livingstone's comments as "outrageously stupid," in an interview to be broadcast at 22:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.  He will add: "Ken should learn to keep his trap shut."  Labour MP Ian Austin, a frequent critic of Mr Corbyn, tweeted that Mr Livingstone's comments were "disgusting. Just disgusting."  Another Labour MP, Jamie Reed, told The Huffington Post: "There's no sewer so fetid that Ken won't swim in it.  "No regard for the victims, no regard for the pain and anger he will have caused, and no care for the damage he continues to do to Labour.  "It's another embarrassment. I look forward to his shame-faced apology for his latest sickening outburst."  Former shadow minister Michael Dugher, who was sacked by Mr Corbyn in his first reshuffle, was quoted as telling the Huffington Post's Paul Waugh: "Ken Livingstone is not fit to lace Dan Jarvis's boots."  Asked if he thought Mr Livingstone's comments were appropriate, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "Well Ken is Ken isn't he, really?"  He added he knew Dan Jarvis and he was "an honest and decent bloke who is making a major contribution to the Labour Party".  Mr McDonnell said he "welcomed" Mr Jarvis's speech, describing it as "part of the democratic debate on the Labour Party".  Mr Jarvis, a former paratrooper, is widely tipped as a future Labour leader.  In his speech on Thursday, he argued for a more "radical" approach to the economy than that pursued by New Labour in order to tackle inequality and win back voters.  According to the Register of Members' Interests, Mr Jarvis received £16,800 from hedge fund manager Martin Taylor in February to support his work as an MP.  Mr Taylor, who according to reports in January was closing his Nevsky Capital hedge fund, has been one of Labour's biggest personal donors in recent years.  Mr Jarvis was also given a donation of £12,500 in January from businessman Peter Hearn, who owns a financial recruitment agency.	politics

At least eight of the British fighters are now dead, the BBC understands.  The whereabouts of the remaining seven men are unknown.  Of those named in the documents, two were killed in an RAF drone strike and three who travelled from Portsmouth died in other attacks.  Another man, Mashudur Choudary, returned to the UK after a few weeks and and became the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the conflict in Syria.	politics

In 2015 there were 17,586 cases of scarlet fever.  Analysts have to go as far back as the year 1967 - when 19,305 cases were reported - to find a year when the numbers were higher.  PHE is alerting all health practitioners to be mindful of the disease when assessing patients.  Scarlet fever is most common in children under ten years old.  PHE said about 600 cases are being flagged up each week in England, and further increases are expected as the infection comes into it the peak season - which typically occurs between late March and mid April.  The number of cases of scarlet fever has soared in the last three years, PHE said.  In 2013 there were just 4,642 cases reported in England and Wales, but this then jumped - by 236% - to 15,625 cases in 2014.  A PHE spokesman said the reason behind the increase in cases was "unclear" but added that it "may reflect the long-term natural cycles in disease incidence seen in many types of infection".  Scarlet fever is caused by bacteria known as group A streptococcus, and it is spread through close contact with people carrying the organism - often in the throat - or through contact with objects and surfaces contaminated with the bacterium.  In the early 1900s through to the 1930s the number of cases of scarlet fever in England and Wales regularly topped 100,000.  Since then the numbers have, broadly speaking, been steadily declining - a trend spurred on by the introduction of antibiotics.  That was of course until 2014 when health experts saw a significant spike in the figures. But why?  In short, the answer has "flummoxed" medical analysts, and cannot be explained through the general rises in population.  Test samples have been collated from different parts of the country and experts believe no new strain of scarlet fever has appeared.  Equally, initial tests suggest the infection has not become resistant to penicillin, but this is being watched closely.  Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance, said: "Symptoms usually clear up after a week and the majority of cases will resolve without complication as long as the recommended course of antibiotics is completed.  "Patients who do not show signs of improvement within a few days of starting treatment should seek urgent medical advice."  In Wales alone, the number of cases recorded in 2015 fell slightly by 10% on the previous year from 1,375 cases to 1,234. But these numbers are still high when compared to the figure for 2013 in Wales which was just 190 cases.  Dr Chris Williams, consultant epidemiologist for Public Health Wales, said: "We are monitoring an increase in scarlet fever in Wales, which is to be anticipated at this time of year."  Meanwhile, Health Protection Scotland said: "Current data shows that cases have been rising through the early part of 2016 in Scotland, the number of laboratory reports is very similar to 2015 levels."  In England, between September 2015 and March 2016, 6,157 cases were reported - a 7% rise on the same period in the previous year.  In Northern Ireland, there were 363 cases in 2015 which is a fall of 41% on 2014 when 625 cases were recorded. In 2013, Northern Ireland had 199 cases.	health

Mr Cameron had become "distracted" after the 2011 intervention in Libya, Mr Obama told the Atlantic magazine. He also described Libya as "a mess".  But in an email to the BBC, a White House spokesman said the US "deeply" valued the UK's contributions.  No 10 said the UK-US relationship remained "special and essential".  In the article Mr Obama reflected on "what went wrong" after the overthrowing of the Gaddafi regime, led by the UK and France.  "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up," he said.  Mr Obama said the UK prime minister soon became "distracted by a range of other things".  The US president said of the North African country: "We averted large-scale civilian casualties, we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict. And despite all that, Libya is a mess."  He also spoke of "free riders", saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi - but, he said, the "habit" for several decades had been "people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game".  In its email to the BBC later, the White House said: "Prime Minister Cameron has been as close a partner as the president has had, and we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives which reflect our special and essential relationship."  On Libya, it said the president had always said "all of us... could have done more".  The White House also said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues", including a pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence.  According to the article, this pledge came after Mr Obama told Mr Cameron that Britain must pay its "fair share" if it wanted to continue to claim a "special relationship" with the US.  The prime minister's official spokeswoman said the relationship between the UK and US "remains a special and essential relationship, as both sides of the Atlantic have said and reiterated in the last day".  She said there was "regular dialogue" between the two leaders' offices on "a whole range of issues".  Responding to suggestions Mr Cameron had been angered by Mr Obama's comments, she said Libya had been "an extremely challenging situation".  She added: "We have done all we can. We think it has been the right approach to try and support a Libyan-led process and that is why we will continue to pursue that type of approach."  US ambassador in London Matthew Barzun told the BBC the relationship between the US and UK "is special and is essential".  He added: "The engagements between our countries' leaders are frequent and they publicly stand up together and talk about what's important. They privately talk all the time and I think that's really important and I wouldn't put over focus on one interview and one paper."  The "special relationship"- always more special to the UK than the US - has survived bigger strains: Suez, Vietnam; the Falklands; and the US invasion of Grenada, to name but a few.  So some disparaging remarks about a British prime minister from an American president doesn't really rate as earth-shattering.  Nonetheless, there is little doubt that No 10 were irritated.  At a press briefing yesterday his spokeswoman said the prime minister couldn't really let a leader - Colonel Gaddafi - torture and terrorise his own people.  The problem is that the president is now looking back on his two terms in the White House, while the PM is fighting for his future in an EU referendum.  So the US moved swiftly to patch up the rocky relationship, sending around the equivalent of flowers after a lovers' tiff in the form of fulsome praise for David Cameron.  But that came too late to avoid the collateral damage delivered to his reputation from the president's candid comments.  Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said criticism for the UK was "pretty rich" because the Americans "did far less" than France or the UK in the aftermath of the intervention.  Oliver Miles, former British ambassador to Libya, said he believed Mr Obama's comments about Mr Cameron being distracted had been "inaccurate" but were not a "big deal".  Andrew Mitchell, who was International Development Secretary during the invasion of Libya, said the President's comments were "extremely unfair and completely untrue".  "It was always clear that there wouldn't be boots on the ground. The House of Commons would never have agreed to British boots on the ground in Libya."  February 2011: Anti-Gaddafi protests erupt on the streets of the second-largest city, Benghazi, spreading to other cities  March 2011: The UN Security Council authorises a no-fly zone over Libya and air strikes to protect civilians. UK MPs vote to authorise military action  October 2011: Gaddafi is captured and killed by rebel fighters in the city of Sirte  The 2011 armed rebellion assisted by Western military intervention led to the end of Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship. But it left a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.  Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival militia-backed parliaments.  A recent UN report said there were hundreds of armed groups and the chaos has allowed so-called Islamic State to gain a foothold.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35786951	Dentist charges to rise 5% in England	Charges for NHS dental treatment in England will rise by 5% this year and next, the government has announced.  By 2017-18, a routine examination will cost more than £20, with more expensive procedures including crowns exceeding £240.  The government said the charges would affect "those who can afford it" and it was "protecting the most vulnerable".  But the British Dental Association said the rise was "unprecedented" and would damage the nation's teeth.  The changes will mean:  In a written statement to Parliament, Health Minister Alistair Burt said: "We have taken the decision to uplift dental charges for those who can afford it, through a 5% increase this year and next.  "Dental charges remain an important contribution to the overall cost of dental services, first introduced in 1951, but we will keep protecting the most vulnerable within society."  Children, pregnant women and people on low incomes get free treatment.  But Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, from the British Dental Association, argued: "This unprecedented hike in dental charges will only serve to discourage the patients that are most in need of care.  "This money doesn't go to NHS dentists - they are being asked to play the role of tax collector, while our patients are singled out to subsidise the health service.  "For government these increases may be a source of easy money, but they will only undermine the relationship between patients and practitioners.  "Government has given patients another reason to avoid visiting their dentist."  Bills for dental treatment vary in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783774	Week ahead	George Osborne's latest Budget will dominate the coming Commons week - indeed, fortnight - as MPs hear the Budget statement and then plunge into four days debate on its content.  The debates will be themed - but we don't know how, because that might provide a clue as to the content of the Budget.  The ritual of Budgets also provides Jeremy Corbyn with his sternest test yet, as Leader of the Opposition; responding to a budget, moments after it has been delivered is a fiendishly difficult assignment, requiring him to keep talking as a research team analyses the information the Chancellor has just provided and feeds him morsels of information and comment which have to be incorporated into the speech as they arrive.  At the same time, the Chancellor will face unusual scrutiny from his own side, as Leave campaigners in the EU Referendum search for subliminal (or overt) pro-Remain messages. He may even be accused, from his own side, of dispensing sweeteners and avoiding unpleasant medicine, to avoid losing referendum votes. It's hard to see how the Budget message can avoid being submerged by Referendum manoeuvring.  Elsewhere, there's plenty of serious legislating going on - notably the Commons debut of the Investigatory Powers Bill, and, in the Lords, the government is braced for a pretty tough week, with a series of defeats on assorted bills and secondary legislation.  First, there's what promises to be a highly tactical battle over the party funding provisions of the Trade Union Bill, where ministers may lose as many as six votes on balloting and political levies. And there may also be more defeats on the Immigration Bill.  Another, slightly longer term, issue to keep an eye on is the slow progress in the detailed scrutiny of the Housing and Planning Bill, where long speeches by a couple of peers have begun to provoke Tory murmurings about an unofficial filibuster.  Already, one extra day has been allocated for these debates, and it might not be the last - and if the bill were not to enter report stage before Easter that would seriously disrupt the legislative timetable. The announcement that the Queen's Speech will be on 18 May sets a deadline for the completion of outstanding parliamentary business - and a long Easter holiday and May day mini-break means there is less time left in the current session of Parliament than a glance at the calendar may suggest....  The Commons opens at 2.30pm with Work and Pensions questions - and any ministerial statements or urgent questions will be taken from 3.30pm.  The day's main legislating is on the Energy Bill, which delivers Conservative manifesto commitments to support investment in UK energy sources, and produce 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. It sets up the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator and ends new subsidies for onshore wind power.  There are some interesting amendments down for the report stage, with a variety on carbon capture and storage. But watch out for a cross party amendment from among others former Labour Leader (and Energy Secretary) Ed Miliband, the Greens' Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams, the SDLP's Dr Alasdair McDonnell, the Conservatives Graham Stuart and Daniel Poulter, and Labour's Paul Blomfield.  It requires that the energy secretary shall set a date by which net UK carbon emissions must be zero or lower ("the zero emissions year") by order no later than a year after the Energy Act 2016 comes into force.  In the Lords (2.30pm), the main event is the continuation (into day six of eight) of the committee stage of the Housing and Planning Bill. The issues will include secure tenancies and "pay to stay"; and they may reach the section on planning issues - although progress through these detailed debates has been at a snail's pace, and there is some suggestion that an extra day of committee may have to be scheduled which could push the report stage of this bill back beyond Easter.  During the dinner break there will be a debate marking the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme, led by the Conservative historian, Lord Lexden.  The Commons (11.30am) the day begins with Business, Innovation and Skills questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Caroline Flint.  She wants to ensure that details of the cross-border tax arrangements of multi-national companies are not only disclosed to HMRC, but also made public. The idea is to highlight where companies are using complicated arrangements to minimise their tax liability. As a member of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, she took part in the hearings with companies like Google - and this bill is one result of that experience. The PAC seems increasingly keen to use this kind of device to highlight the findings of its inquiries.  The main event is the second reading of the Investigatory Powers Bill , which will be the opening move in what looks likely to be an intensive parliamentary battle (see previous blog post). And then MPs debate a de-proscription order on the International Sikh Youth Foundation, under the Terrorism Act 2000 - removing it from the list of banned organisations.  In the Lords (2.30pm), peers continue their detailed report stage scrutiny of the Immigration Bill - where the government lost two votes this week. The key issues include the right to rent, the offence of driving by illegal immigrants, the health surcharge, immigration detention, depart first - appeal later, and the treatments of unaccompanied asylum seeker children- watch out for votes and quite possibly further government defeats on issues around detention of vulnerable people.  During the dinner break there is a regret motion from Labour Justice Spokesman, Lord Beecham, on the Civil Proceedings, Family Proceedings and Upper Tribunal Fees (Amendment) Order - it might be pushed to a vote. Labour and the Lib Dems are getting quite competitive about opposing statutory instruments put down by the government.  The Commons day opens (11.30am) with International Development questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's question time. And then comes the Budget - in the subsequent debate watch out for interventions foreshadowing an amendment to the Finance Bill (the measure which puts the Budget into effect) to help women left poorer by state pension age rises - the pension age for women will rise to 65 in November 2018 and 66 by October 2020.  In the Lords (from 3pm) the crucial report stage consideration of the Trade Union Bill begins. The crux of the debate will be the amendment from Crossbencher and former civil servant Lord Burns who chaired a special select committee examining the impact of the bill on party funding.  Labour peers believe proposed opt-in rules for paying into union political funds will devastate the finances of their party. Lord Burns will propose changes that would substantially reduce the impact by applying the opt-in only to new union members. It looks likely there will be a majority for his amendment, so long as the vote is held before the dinner break, when peers often drift away from the Chamber.  As noted above, other defeats may follow - the other issues at play include ballot thresholds, e-balloting, union annual returns, and facility time for union officials, and the government may offer a bit of wriggle room around some technical issues.  But it wants Labour, in particular, to accept the principle of union members opting in to paying money to political parties. If that principle is rejected by the Lords, there are some in Tory high command who would relish the chance to impose the bill via the Parliament Act; if that happens, the bill becomes law in the form in which it left the Commons, which would mean losing the concessions already offered on allowing e-voting for union ballots, for example, which would mean they would be required to introduce a paper based opt-in process for the political levy, within a matter of months.  It's quite a threat and the interesting question is whether Labour and the other critics will be prepared to negotiate a compromise. There's certainly no prospect of the government agreeing a quid pro quo where it promises to introduce restrictions on individual political donations - they argue that Labour introduced curbs on company political funding without any compensating curbs on their own donations.  There may also be a vote on the dinner break business - a regret motion from Lib Dem Baroness Featherstone on the Renewables Obligation Order that ends early the subsidy for small solar installations, which may provide a desert for the Opposition after the main course in the bill.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with a series of mini-question times: three quarters of an hour on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and then half an hour for the MPs who speak in the Commons for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission - and that will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, and then, the continuation of the Budget debate.  In Westminster Hall, there's a backbench debate on cabin air safety and aerotoxic syndrome led by Jonathan Reynolds, Graham Brady and Dawn Butler. This follows the results of a series of inquests which suggest cabin crew may be at risk  In the Lords (11am), the Housing and Planning Bill committee stage grinds into day seven, with peers due to look at issues around planning and compulsory purchase.  And neither House sits on Friday.	politics

Under his plan, day-to-day spending would not exceed government income although there would be scope for borrowing for capital investment.  "There is nothing left wing about excessive spending, nothing socialist about too much debt", he said.  The Tories said Labour had a history of spending and borrowing too much.  And Spencer Livermore, a former aide to Ed Miliband, said the policy was scarcely different from what Labour offered at the last election and the party risked "repeating its mistakes".  Mr McDonnell's announcement comes five days before the Budget, in which Chancellor George Osborne is widely expected to confirm the UK's economic performance has deteriorated in recent months and announce further spending cuts to reduce the deficit, forecast to be £73.5bn this year.  The shadow chancellor said this was an "astonishing turnaround" from Mr Osborne's more upbeat assessment of the UK's economic prospects at the time of November's Spending Review and that the chancellor was now having to "admit shamefaced" that the outlook was not so rosy.  Labour is under pressure to demonstrate it can be trusted on the economy after its election defeat, which was widely blamed on its failure to convince the public it had a plan to control public spending and borrowing, boost growth and raise living standards.  Labour insisted that the new rule was not a commitment to spend more money than the present government.  Chancellor George Osborne has put in place rules saying that the government will create an overall budget surplus "in normal times".  Labour voted against the rule in Parliament, and Mr McDonnell said any future Labour government wanted to invest more than the Conservatives. Which could mean more borrowing.  The Office for Budget Responsibility - the government's economic watchdog - will be given new powers to "whistle blow" when it believes that the "credibility rule" has been breached. And under the Labour plans it will also report to Parliament rather than the Treasury. Read more  Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, Labour has been more vocal in its opposition to austerity but efforts to build a coherent economic policy suffered a setback when Mr McDonnell did a U-turn over his support for the government's deficit reduction plan in the face of opposition from his MPs.  In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell - a key ally of Mr Corbyn's who is also on the left of the party - insisted Labour must have a plan to get the public finances back into the black but, unlike the government, it will do so in a "fair and responsible manner".  Under its new "fiscal credibility" framework, a future Labour government would be obliged to keep day-to-day spending in balance with tax returns and other revenues generated by the government to ensure there is no annual current deficit.  It would also commit to reducing overall government debt - the total aggregate of government borrowing which currently stands at £1.5 trillion - during the lifetime of the next Parliament, expected to begin in 2020, and every Parliament after that.  However, the new rules, which Labour says will be "scrupulously" enforced by the Office for Budget Responsibility, will leave room for more borrowing to pay for capital expenditure in infrastructure such as roads, railways, homes and energy.  "The fiscal credibility rule is not about making spending commitments," Mr McDonnell insisted. "It is about providing a framework for the responsible management of public finances," he said.  "We must be a party that thinks first about how we earn money, not only how we spend money."  "There is nothing left-wing about excessive spending," he will add. "There is nothing socialist about running up too much debt. When governments do not manage their finances responsibly, it is ordinary working people who eventually suffer.  "When governments try to disguise their spending, it is accountability and democracy that suffer."  Since the mid-1990s, Gordon Brown and his successors have adopted a succession of fiscal rules in order to try and demonstrate Labour's discipline in public spending.  Under Ed Miliband's leadership, Labour proposed to reduce the deficit every year and balance the books, in terms of current spending, during the lifetime of the current Parliament.  It is also pledged to get debt as a share of GDP falling but made no firm commitment on borrowing to invest in infrastructure.  The Conservative government has gone further, targeting a £10bn surplus in both current and capital spending by 2019-2020 and aiming for a continuous budget surplus "in normal times" thereafter.  Many economists believe Mr Osborne will have to revise his targets because of lower growth forecasts, affecting his ability to hit borrowing targets.  The Conservatives dismissed Mr McDonnell's announcement, claiming Labour "hadn't learnt their lesson and couldn't be trusted on the economy".  "Labour spent and borrowed too much last time they were in power. At a time of uncertainty in the global economy, Labour is serious threat to our economic security and it is working people who will pay the price."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35779133	BBC Two to screen documentary on 'misunderstood' House of Lords	BBC Two has commissioned a series filmed inside the House of Lords which it says will give "unprecedented" insight into peers' work.  The three-part documentary series, produced by independent company Top Hat, will be aired later this year.  Filming will take place over several months, in a format similar to the Inside the Commons documentary which was broadcast on BBC Two last year.  It aims to "see how public perception stacks up to reality", the BBC says.  The House of Lords has been under renewed scrutiny since it acted to delay tax credit cuts in October 2015.  The controversial move prompted the government to launch a review of the Lords' powers, which recommended they should lose their absolute veto over secondary legislation.  The BBC says the documentary will show the "characters" who populate the upper chamber and "their aims, dilemmas and frustrations".  The programme will take in the current arguments about whether, and how, to pursue reform of the House of Lords.  Fiona Campbell, head of BBC Current Affairs, hailed it as a chance "to shed some light for our viewers on the inner workings of this long-standing pillar of politics in this country".  Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza said: "The House of Lords is often misunderstood because there are few opportunities for the public to find out about its role and work."  She described the series as an "opportunity to see the important work that is done by the House".  Peers held a debate in January on their public image in which a number of members complained about the lack of understanding of their role and the way they are portrayed in the press.  Lord Hodgson of Astley-Abbots, who tabled the debate, expressed his concern about "the rising number of snide, unfounded and unhelpful articles about your Lordships' House that are quite unconnected with our legislative activities".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783771	The whys and wherefores: Sunday Trading and EVEL	Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, the procedural tangles created by EVEL - English Votes for English Laws - continue to baffle MPs.  This week's Commons debate on the Enterprise Bill saw ministers bewildered, and indeed Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle openly admitted he didn't know what was going on.  And outsiders might have been pretty confused, too.  For a start, why did an amendment to change the rules on Sunday Trading in England and Wales not invoke EVEL?  Well, the clause it applied to dealt with employment rights, which are a UK-wide issue. For the powers of EVEL to be called down upon the Commons, the issue involved must (1) arise in a government bill, (2) apply only to one segment of the UK (England or England and Wales, say) and (3) deal with a matter where the devolved legislatures could pass an equivalent statute, if so minded.  These rules have a number of interesting implications - for example, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs would have a vote on a private member's bill to designate an English national anthem.  But back to Sunday trading - and that clause fell foul of the third condition, because its drafting bundled a right to opt out of Sunday working together with devolving the regulation of trading hours to local authorities. That combination was the actual stumbling block here. Mr Speaker has to certify bills as subject to the EVEL rules clause by clause....  So the whole clause had to be exempt.  I don't know if this was accident or design, but it certainly highlights an area where a government could game the EVEL rules and try to ensure that certain clauses were not eligible for the process.  Another EVEL point is that, although the removal of the clause on Sunday trading would not have happened but for Scottish votes (if Scottish MPs had abstained from the division, the government would have had a majority of 21), the EVEL rules (and there are 30 pages of Commons standing orders setting out the procedure) provide no way of putting it back.  The English Grand Committee, which is the vehicle for English-only voting, can block parts of a bill, but not add to it.  At least in this Parliament, where we have a government whose majority rests on English MPs, it is very hard to see EVEL being deployed to amend a bill; a future government would have a harder time if it did not have a majority of English MPs, but for the time being, its little more than a parliamentary ritual.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35773030	NHS consultants: Employers 'close to 7-day contract offer'	Consultants in England could be offered new NHS contracts within weeks, the BBC understands, after what ministers have called "constructive" negotiations.  Ministers want to remove a clause that lets consultants opt out of providing non-emergency care at weekends as part of their plans for a "seven-day NHS".  A breakthrough is seen as vital by the government as it tries to move on from the junior doctors row.  The latest strike by junior medics ends at 08:00 GMT on Friday.  The 48-hour stoppage is the third walkout, with another two planned for next month as the profession fights the imposition of the new contract.  The talks with consultants' leaders at the BMA began in autumn and slowed down at the turn of the year.  However, momentum has gathered in recent weeks, the BBC has been told, and there is a possibility they could conclude before Easter, with meetings held this week and planned for next.  The negotiations, led by NHS Employers for ministers, have centred on removing the weekend opt-out consultants have for non-emergency care.  The government believes this is a major barrier to getting more consultants to work weekends, although the BMA says its research suggests nine in 10 consultants do some level of weekend working.  The opt-out means doctors can command pay three or four times the normal rate when they are asked to do non-emergency weekend shifts. Some of the bonuses consultants get have also been discussed.  Sources close to the talks said there had been "good progress" recently.  But there is concern within the BMA that if consultants do agree a deal it could leave junior doctors isolated, with ministers intent on imposing the contract on them from the summer.  A spokeswoman for the BMA said the talks remained "ongoing" but there had not yet been an agreement.  Any offer would have to be put out to the BMA's consultant membership and consideration is even being given to asking those junior doctors at the end of their training - and therefore close to becoming a consultant - whether they would be happy with the deal.  A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "We want to introduce a fairer contract for consultants that better reflects their role as leaders in our NHS and helps to ensure patients get safe, high-quality care every day of the week.  "Talks with the BMA over proposed amendments to consultant contracts have been constructive."	health

Westminster politics, scientific research and diplomatic matters have not been on the agenda.  Instead, this international gathering was all about making hospitals safer.  The patient safety conference was the first such global meeting of its kind led by ministers.  At the centre of the discussions was a striking figure - there are apparently one million deaths every year around the world caused by medical mistakes.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who co-hosted the conference with his German counterpart, said the figure for such avoidable deaths in England was about 750 a week.  "We need," he told the conference, "to ask what is blocking the development of the supportive, learning culture we need to make our hospitals as safe as they should be".  Much progress had been made in England, said Mr Hunt, since the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, with a tougher inspection regime playing a part.  But change was still needed, with a move away from a "blame" culture, he added.  New measures were unveiled by the secretary of state to try to achieve this shift, including tougher legal protection for NHS whistleblowers, and staff participating in internal trust investigations and enquiries on safety incidents mounted by external agencies.  The airline industry is widely quoted in this context.  Journalist Matthew Syed, author of Black Box Thinking, spoke at the conference. He referred to an accident which changed the safety culture in aviation.  A crash in the 1970s which left 10 dead was blamed on the pilot failing to notice that his plane was dangerously low on fuel.  But at the time, he was dealing with another potentially lethal problem with the landing gear.  Colleagues either had not noticed or for whatever reason did not tell him about the fuel issue.  The lesson was that there had to be much more open discussion, with the most junior team members encouraged to speak up.  Airlines have transformed safety training and reduced accidents. Now there is a push to take health in the same direction.  The newly-announced policies include a health-safety investigation agency following the precedent of the Air Accident Investigation Branch.  A crucial part of its brief will be to hold "no-blame" investigations.  That is where the legal protection aspect is so important. Staff will know they can speak frankly about hospital incidents without fear of their evidence being used against them.  Central to this philosophy is the idea of continuous improvement and that however senior a clinician or manager may be, there is always scope to test procedures and experiment with new ways of working.  Ministers believe that the NHS delivers world-class performance in many areas - but must be honest about those failures which do happen.  Openness about safety and rectifying mistakes must be embedded in everyday working, they say.  Some at the conference see the renewed safety drive by the Department of Health as a watershed moment.  But Peter Walsh, of Action against Medical Accidents, has questioned the protection against future litigation for NHS staff giving evidence to investigations.  He argues this will mean patients who have suffered because of mistakes could be denied access to justice.  Junior doctors out on picket lines in England this week have also criticised the government's credentials on safety because, in their view, a new contract is being imposed with weaker safeguards on working hours.  Mr Hunt has made transparency and honesty over safety in the NHS one of his mantras.  It is his chosen agenda rather than the growing pressures on A&E and other declining performance issues also highlighted this week.  The patient safety conference and pronouncements will ultimately have to be judged against outcomes.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35778000	Could Labour plotters oust Jeremy Corbyn as leader?	"We need to have more courage," a Labour MP, newly elected last year, confided to me in the corridors of Westminster.  "Lots of people are talking about a battle of ideas. But that can wait. There is nothing more important than ditching Jeremy Corbyn."  An ex-minister close to the former leader Gordon Brown was, in private, even more robust: "Labour is facing an existential threat.  "If Jeremy Corbyn leads us in to the 2020 election, it's all over for the party. We are screwed."  While some in the parliamentary party rail against their leader, others are more resigned to his continuation in office - and the consequences. A former minister close to another former leader - Tony Blair - declared: "I find a new reason to despair every day."  And some of their colleagues who attended a meeting of Labour's Parliamentary party on Monday night were incensed by reports of how the proceedings were briefed by Mr Corbyn's spokesman.  He had characterised the meeting as marking the night the Labour mainstream sided with Jeremy Corbyn, who had face down his internal opponents.  The leader had called for unity and told his MPs to stop "sniping" - and they in turn had tempered their criticism. There had been a "sea change in attitudes" said the spokesman.  Some of those present did not recognise this account and the "sea change" appears, in fact, to be a hardening of the attitudes of those who want Jeremy Corbyn ousted.  There has been a lot of shadow boxing between a Parliamentary Labour Party which overwhelmingly opposed Mr Corbyn's election as leader - and members and supporters who delivered it.  But now, at the very least, a minority of MPs seem more determined than ever to mount a challenge sooner rather than later.  The May elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities are set to be spun by Mr Corbyn's allies and critics alike.  At Monday's meeting the party leader refused to be drawn on how many council seats he expects to win (or lose).  That is meant to make it trickier for opponents to declare he has failed.  But party insiders believe 200 or more seats in England are vulnerable.  So the Corbynistas are responding in two ways.  The successor to the Corbyn leadership campaign - Momentum - will try to put well motivated activists into areas which are vulnerable.  With poor turnouts in many council contests, it's possible a good "ground war" could reap benefits and stem losses - or even lead to some unexpected gains. Momentum bussed supporters into the Oldham West by-election late last year.  The assumption was that Labour might just scrape home on a low turnout - in fact a relatively respectable 40% went to the polls, and Labour's vote share increased.  But even if council results turn out to be disappointing, the leadership are confident Sadiq Khan will defeat Zac Goldsmith in the London mayoral contest and that Labour won't slip to third place in Scotland.  And this will be presented as proof that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is far from toxic and he needs more time to mobilise further support for the party.  In this narrative, setbacks elsewhere will have been due to the Parliamentary "snipers" shooting their own leader in the foot.  On the other side, senior MPs are circulating a paper pointing out how well Labour should be doing at this stage in the electoral cycle.  It concludes that opposition parties have always gained seats over the past 40 years except in 1982 - when Labour was in opposition but suffered the SDP split - and in 1985 when the Militant Tendency and the miners' strike were in the headlines.  So some former ministers are likely to set targets of their own for Jeremy Corbyn - anything less than 300 gains will be denounced as unsatisfactory.  So let's assume - and this is not a prediction, just a scenario - that some Labour MPs will say Jeremy Corbyn has failed to clear the hurdles they have constructed for him. The rules are clear that it would take 20% of the combined total of Labour MPs and MEPs - 51 politicians - to trigger a leadership challenge.  But It's less clear if Jeremy Corbyn's name would then automatically be on the ballot.  The rule book here is open to interpretation.  One Corbyn opponent points out that when Tony Benn challenged the incumbent Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, the latter was required to gather nominations, too - and he says this would set a precedent.  And Labour officials stress the importance of "custom and practice" when determining these issues.  That would mean Mr Corbyn would then have to gather 35 nominations from his fellow MPs to stand, if challenged.  He only gained that number last year because some of his Parliamentary colleagues wanted to "broaden the debate" and didn't expect him to win.  So it's possible he could be kept off the ballot. And that would be the best opportunity opponents would have to defeat him.  A YouGov poll of party members in February suggested if Jeremy Corbyn were on the ballot paper, he would win a leadership contest comfortably, with "soft-left" shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn second, and ex-paratrooper Dan Jarvis - who gave a keynote speech on Thursday in which he denounced inequality and distanced himself, to a degree, from New Labour - narrowly behind in third place.  However, members were also shown a ballot paper without Jeremy Corbyn's name on it - and Hilary Benn, Tom Watson, Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis were pretty much bunched together in that order.  So, unsurprisingly, Mr Corbyn's supporters in the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are trying to make the rules less ambiguous - by getting the party's sovereign body, the annual conference, to agree that if challenged, the leader's name would automatically be on any ballot - and in future only 5%, not 15%, of MPs would need to nominate a candidate if Mr Corbyn were to stand down.  This would mean about a dozen MPs would have to give their backing. As Jeremy Corbyn had 14 genuine supporters in the Parliamentary party at last year's leadership contest, this lower threshold would mean a left-wing successor could not be blocked by their sceptical Parliamentary colleagues.  They would then put themselves before a membership whose centre of gravity is to the left of most Labour MPs for approval.  So that is why some of those who were close to either Blair or Brown believe it is worth trying to challenge the current leader before his position becomes more entrenched.  But despite all the talk about rules, privately the plotters believe that even if Mr Corbyn were required to seek nominations from fellow MPs to re-stand, due to a mixture of patronage and the fear of being deselected by new left-wing party members, it's perfectly possible that 35 MPs would support him this time in any case.  If so, any challenger would have their work cut out, according to that You Gov membership survey.  Two thirds of respondents said they wanted Jeremy Corbyn to lead Labour into the next general election. But crucially, asked if he should do so even if the May elections go badly for Labour, 53% of members would still want him to remain as leader until at least 2020.  So now there isn't just a division between most Labour MPs and their leader.  Amongst the non-Corbynistas, there are those that say it would be pointless to launch a leadership contest he is likely to win - and those who say they have to be seen to be making the argument that he is leading the party to disaster.  The mood between the two camps isn't quite as convivial as it once was.  A member of the latter group privately denounced the former as "collaborators". Members of this albeit fluid grouping - "there isn't a Committee to Get Rid of Jeremy Corbyn", said one MP - are coming to the conclusion that a leadership challenge is worth a roll of the dice.  But would Mr Corbyn simply fall on his sword if May's elections bring poor results?  Some MPs say he isn't enjoying the job but a well-connected former Labour strategist is convinced he wouldn't step aside.  He says sections of the press - and Parliament - are "using the wrong metric to look at his success and failure".  He believes "those around him want to take on and change the party before thinking about trying to change the country - so winning elections isn't their priority".  So if he won't go of his own volition, July seems to be the likely time for a challenge.  As Dan Jarvis pointed out in his remarks to Westminster journalists on Thursday, Labour members and supporters would not forgive MPs who are entirely focussed on May's elections and June's referendum.  But whenever a contest comes, Mr Corbyn's backers are confident he would win because the mood amongst the membership is against a return to "top down" politics and Parliamentary coups.  They don't buy the idea that, whatever the rules, it would be possible to exclude a leader who gained an overwhelming mandate just six months ago.  A leading light in Momentum put it like this: "They can challenge Jeremy if they want. Just so long as they know it would be a kamikaze operation."	politics

Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now "a mess".  The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence.  In response, Number 10 said there were "many difficult challenges" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions.  Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year.  In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been "as close a partner as the president has had" adding that "we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives".  BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article.  "It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can," he added.  The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.  The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on "what went wrong", saying: "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."  Mr Cameron, he said, became "distracted by a range of other things". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight.  The former French president, he said, "wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure" for the intervention.  President Obama said the intervention "averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict". But he added: "And despite all that, Libya is a mess."  He also criticised what he called "free riders" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: "But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."  Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.  In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the "Libyan people were given the opportunity" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter of "huge regret" they had not taken it.  He stressed that - unlike in Iraq - the post-conflict planning was locally driven.  "Gaddafi was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats," he said. "An international coalition came together to protect those people and to help the Libyan people, who then got rid of Gaddafi.  "And they had an opportunity to build what they said they wanted."  Responding to President Obama's interview, Downing Street said "coming to the aid of innocent civilians who were being tortured and killed by their leader was the right thing to do".  The government has tried to support stability in Libya and is "working hard to support the UN-led process to establish a stable and inclusive government that will allow them to build a peaceful future", a spokesman said.  "But ultimately a positive outcome for Libya is not just up to the international community - this process needs to be led by the Libyan people," he added.  The US National Security Council spokesman added: "With respect to Libya, the president has long said that all of us - including the United States - could have done more in the aftermath of the Libyan intervention."  He said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues" including meeting the 2% commitment and pressing other Nato members to do the same.  Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said it was "a bit rich" for the US president to single out the UK and France, as they had carried out more air operations in the Libya campaign than any other country.  21 February - David Cameron, on a tour of the Middle East, condemns violence by the Gaddafi regime.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35775743	Gum disease link to Alzheimer's, research suggests	Gum disease has been linked to a greater rate of cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's disease, early stage research has suggested.  The small study, published in PLOS ONE, looked at 59 people who were all deemed to have mild to moderate dementia.  It is thought the body's response to gum inflammation may be hastening the brain's decline.  The Alzheimer's Society said if the link was proven to be true, then good oral health may help slow dementia.  The body's response to inflammatory conditions was cited as a possible reason for the quicker decline.  Inflammation causes immune cells to swell and has long been associated with Alzheimer's. Researchers believe their findings add weight to evidence that inflammation in the brain is what drives the disease.  The study, jointly led by the University of Southampton and King's College London, cognitively assessed the participants, and took blood samples to measure inflammatory markers in their blood.  Their oral health was also assessed by a dental hygienist who was unaware of the cognitive outcomes.  Of the sample group, 22 were found to have considerable gum disease while for the remaining 37 patients the disease was much less apparent. The average age of the group with gum disease was 75, and in the other group it was 79.  A majority of participants - 52 - were followed up at six months, and all assessments were repeated.  The presence of gum disease - or periodontitis as it is known - was associated with a six-fold increase in the rate of cognitive decline, the study suggested.  Dentist Dr Mark Ide from King's College London told the BBC News website he was "surprised" by the rate of decline, and said that as patients with gum disease chew on their teeth they were effectively giving themselves "mini-injections" of bacteria into their bloodstream.  "In just six months you could see the patients going downhill - it's really quite scary," he said.  Higher levels of antibodies to periodontal bacteria are associated with an increase in levels of inflammatory molecules elsewhere in the body - which in turn have been linked to greater rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.  Prof Clive Holmes, senior author from the University of Southampton, said the results were "very interesting" and proved that this study needed to be carried out again but using a larger number of participants.  "However, if there is a direct relationship between periodontitis and cognitive decline, as this current study suggests, then treatment of gum disease might be a possible treatment option for Alzheimer's," he said.  He also said his researchers had taken into account the fact that gum disease may become more common in those people with Alzheimer's, because of a reduced ability to take care of oral hygiene as the disease progresses.  Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society, also recognised that the study "adds evidence to the idea that gum disease could potentially be a contributing factor to Alzheimer's".  "If this is proven to be the case, better dental hygiene would offer a relatively straightforward way to help slow the progression of dementia and enable people to remain independent for longer," he said.  But he also described the study as "small" and said it was currently "unclear" whether the gum disease was the cause or the effect.  "We don't know if the gum disease is triggering the faster decline of dementia, or vice versa," he said.  In the UK around 80% of adults over 55 years old had evidence of gum disease, according to the adult dental survey of 2009, which is the latest data available.  There are around half a million people living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK .	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35766166	Hospitals 'may end up overcrowded during strike'	Hospitals could end up overcrowded on Thursday as they struggle to discharge patients because of the junior doctors strike, NHS leaders are warning.  The NHS in England seemed to cope well on Wednesday following the walkout from 08:00 GMT over the contract dispute.  But NHS England said the second day of the 48-hour walkout was always going to be more difficult.  Officials said hospitals might struggle to discharge patients without junior medics on wards.  More than 5,000 operations were postponed ahead of the action to try to relieve pressures.  But Dr Anne Rainsberry, who is in charge of planning during the strike, suggested hospitals might find it difficult to discharge patients, which could then create a backlog in hospital wards.  She said this was because they had a "valuable role" in chasing up test results and ensuring patients were ready for discharge.  "So far the NHS is holding up, but we always expected the second half of the strike will be more challenging," she said.  She also urged patients to go to hospital only when absolutely necessary.  "If people need medical help and it's not an emergency they should consider NHS Choices, visit their local pharmacy, or call their GP or NHS 111 for more serious matters.  "If their condition is an emergency or life-threatening they should call 999 as usual or go to A&E."  Doctors are providing emergency cover during the walkout, which ends on Friday morning, and consultants, nurses and midwives are all working in hospital as normal. GP surgeries are largely unaffected.  Will the dispute have a toxic legacy?  What patients need to know during strike  The situation across the rest of the UK  Special report: Read more on the dispute  Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA's junior doctor leader, said the strike had been well supported by the profession with 147 picket lines taking place.  "We deeply regret the disruption to patients and we remain open to talks with the government to try and resolve this dispute."  But he added: "If the government wants more from an already overstretched workforce it will need to ensure there are more doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals, alongside additional funding. Ministers have failed to provide any detailed plan as to how their vague and unclear plans will be delivered."  The government has said there is no extra money for junior doctors.  On both Wednesday and Thursday, just over half of junior doctors expected in work did not turn up - a figure broadly in line with the previous strikes and to be expected considering the numbers needed to provide emergency care.  Analysis: Was a deal ever possible?  The latest walkout is the third in the long-running dispute, but the first to last 48 hours.  So far 19,000 operations and treatments have had to be postponed because of industrial action. The NHS carries out about 30,000 procedures a day.  Thousands of check-ups, appointments and tests have been affected as well.  This week's walkout is the first of three 48-hour stoppages planned by the British Medical Association as it continues its fight against the government's plans. The next two are planned for April.  The union has also said it will be launching a legal challenge to oppose the imposition of the contract that was announced following last month's strike.  But ministers have said they will be pushing ahead with imposition regardless. The new contracts are due to go out in May and will come into force from August.  Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which represented the government in talks, said it was "hugely disappointing" that doctors were taking action as the contract was "safe, fair and reasonable".  He said the strike would be causing "much disruption to patients and their families which is completely unnecessary".	health

It follows a Daily Telegraph report saying he received fees for sponsoring dinners and a breakfast on the Parliamentary estate.  In a letter to Ms Hudson, he said all the fees were paid to charity.  According to the Commons Code of Conduct, MPs' use of public resources should always be "in support of their parliamentary duties" and should not "confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves or anyone else, or confer undue advantage on a political organisation".  in his letter to Ms Hudson, Sir Kevin wrote: "My own understanding is that due to the fact that I made no personal gain and all the fees were paid to a charity, I had not breached the rules on usage of parliamentary facilities for personal or business use.

The 35,629 calls played a recorded message urging support for his failed campaign to be Labour's candidate.  Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said the same rules apply to canvassing for votes as apply "to offering a discount on double glazing".  People getting Mr Lammy's calls had not given permission to receive them.  This meant, according to the Information Commissioner's Office investigation, Mr Lammy had broken the rules set out in the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations.  Mr Graham said: "If you want to call someone in this way, you must follow these rules. Mr Lammy did not, and that is why he has been fined.  "It's not good enough to assume the people you're contacting probably won't mind. The law requires you to have permission before making calls with recorded messages. And if the law isn't followed, the regulator will act."  The calls were made in August 2015 using contact details of party members provided by the Labour Party. Mr Lammy did not make the additional checks necessary to ensure he was able to contact the people with recorded messages, the watchdog said.  Mr Graham said: "Mr Lammy's team should have known there were special controls in place around calls with recorded messages. Not only have we published detailed guidance on political campaigning on our website, but we have contacted political parties directly to remind them of the rules."  Mr Lammy came fourth in the contest last year to become Labour's candidate in the forthcoming London mayoral elections with 9.4% of first preferences.  He said: "I fully accept the Information Commissioner's decision and apologise unreservedly to any Labour Party member or registered supporter that felt upset at receiving an automated call from my campaign.  "If I had known that additional permission was required to make automated calls then I would have sought it before any calls were made."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768969	Revolutionary socialist Gerry Downing to appeal against Labour expulsion	Gerry Downing, a revolutionary socialist expelled by Labour after criticism of his views on 9/11, has said he will appeal against the move.  David Cameron called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to expel him from the party at Prime Minister's Questions.  Labour's ruling NEC later said it had excluded him after "further evidence" had come to light about him.  Mr Downing said his views on 9/11 and so-called Islamic State had been quoted out of context.  In the Commons on Wednesday, David Cameron quoted a blog by Mr Downing, which said the 9/11 hijackers "must never be condemned".  Mr Downing insisted he had been explaining the motivation of the 9/11 attackers, "not agreeing with what they were doing", adding: "I don't support the politics of Isis, they are vile barbarians. But I don't support American imperialist bombing either."  Mr Downing, a former bus driver and member of the tiny Socialist Fight group, told the Daily Politics: "The ambition to overthrow capitalism is a very legitimate political ambition."  He was expelled by the Labour Party last August over views expressed on his Twitter feed and blog but was re-instated in November after an appeal.  Mr Downing said he "had been" a Labour member until Wednesday night, "but nobody bothered to inform" him that he'd been excluded.  He told the Daily Politics the party "should be welcoming" to people with his views and he planned to seek re-admittance.  "If it allows UKIP councillors who defect and it allows people from the far right, and people of that nature, I cannot see why it should not allow in people like me."  Asked by presenter Andrew Neil whether he would condemn the 9/11 attackers, Mr Downing said he wouldn't use the word "condemn", saying he would seek to "understand the motivation of the people that did that."  Mr Downing said his group does not support so-called Islamic State "militarily or politically" but he does believe in providing "tactical" support, which he explained as being against US bombing.  He said he was not a "personal friend" of John McDonnell but said the shadow chancellor had "secured some justice for me" in a work dispute, after the two men met on the Labour Representation Committee.  Times journalist Philip Collins, a former speech writer to Tony Blair, said he was "delighted" Mr Downing had been expelled, telling him there was "no place in the Labour Party for your views".  In an open letter to Mr Corbyn, before Mr Downing's latest expulsion, Labour MP John Woodcock, a longstanding critic of the Labour leader, said his group's views were "sickening and bring our party into disrepute".  In a statement of its aims on its website, Socialist Fight says: "We defend the 'Islamic State' in Syria and Iraq against the bombing of US imperialism but do not ally with them against the Kurdish defenders of Kobane and Rojava (Western Kurdistan)."  The post goes on to explain its stance in some detail. saying, among things, that "the Islamic State is a reactionary utopia and has no legitimate right to self-determination".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35774687	Rocky road ahead	It's one of the biggest and most significant bills of this Parliament - and it could prove to be very vulnerable to a dangerous combination of Tory dissidents and Opposition parties.  The Investigatory Powers Bill - the new "Snoopers' Charter" to its critics - is the latest attempt to create a legal framework for an armoury of internet surveillance powers, which the government believes are critical to the fight against terrorism, organised crime and online paedophilia.  But because it has to be through Parliament before the end of December, its opponents have a great deal of leverage against it.  The reasons lie in the long backstory behind this latest bill; first, there was the Communications Data Bill, which was dropped by the coalition, after a savaging from a joint committee of MPs and peers.  Then there was the compromise measure DRIPA, the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, which only got through Parliament after a "sunset clause" was added, under which many of the powers it granted would expire at the end of the year.  Which explains the urgency around the Investigatory Powers Act, because a new law has to be in place, to ensure current powers don't lapse after that December deadline.  The bill would provide an armoury of new powers - as the Home Secretary, Theresa May, told Parliament, it would give powers to "law enforcement, the security and intelligence agencies and the armed forces to acquire the content of communications or communications data. These include the ability to retain and acquire communications data to be used as evidence in court and to advance investigations; the ability to intercept the contents of communications in order to acquire sensitive intelligence to tackle terrorist plots and serious and organised crimes; the use of equipment interference powers to obtain data covertly from computers; and the use of these powers by the security and intelligence agencies in bulk to identify the most serious threats to the UK from overseas and to rapidly establish links between suspects in the UK."  To many civil libertarians the proposed powers are unacceptably intrusive, and at the very least extremely powerful safeguards need to be in place around them - the government is offering a "double lock" requiring both the home secretary and a judge to sign off on interception warrants.  This is the kind of issue which could unite Labour (mostly, anyway; there are senior figures with worried about appearing soft on terror), the SNP and the Lib Dems, as well as the modest group of Tory critics around uber-awkward squaddie, David Davis.  We will get an early indication of how co-ordinated these groups are, and how hard they intend to fight on Tuesday at the second reading debate.  There are unlikely to be actual votes against the bill, because no-one wants to be accused of being soft on crime and terrorism, but there could well be abstentions, and some parties could even whip their MPs to abstain.  And there may also be a bit of action around the programme motion; so big and so significant is this bill, that there are calls for it to be given an unusually long report stage, to allow MPs to propose detailed changes. There is already talk of a two-day report stage; some critics argue for four, and their demands could well be put to a vote.  The real moment of Commons danger will probably come during that report stage (however many days are devoted to it) when cross-party amendments are likely on a range of issues. Again, these are likely to be presented in terms of what is most effective in fighting terrorism and organised crime; there is an argument, for example, that bulk data collection powers result in the security services or the police trying to find a needle in a much larger haystack.  It is probably too early to identify exactly what issues will be pushed - but this is one of those rare measures which might bring together a Commons majority against the government. And it will test the powers of the ministerial team behind the bill - John Hayes, the Security Minister, and Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, as well as of the government whips.  A crucial factor in all this is the slightly unlikely, but very real alliance, between Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, and David Davis, which combines two hardened Commons street-fighters. In fact they may get in an early blow, if they succeed in challenging some of the data retention powers in the European Court. A ruling in their favour there could gut a major part of this bill.  And all this is before the bill arrives in the House of Lords, where, of course, the government does not have even a theoretical majority. And the problem for ministers there is that if the bill is to become law by that December deadline, there simply is not the time to override unwelcome Lords amendments by means of the Parliament Act, which gives peers considerable leverage to force the government to compromise.  One possible deal would be to pass a mini-bill simply extending the existing DRIPA powers, while allowing much longer for Parliament to ponder the rest of the Investigatory Powers Bill.  But the Security Minister, John Hayes, told me on Radio 4's Today in Parliament, last week, that that would be a "soft option" and noted that there had been extensive consideration of the bill in draft, by three different select committees, so the issues were hardly new to MPs or peers. But he's clearly braced for a rough few months.	politics

The Barnsley Central MP argued in a speech that Labour did not do enough when it was in power to tackle inequality and fears about immigration.  He took a swipe at New Labour - saying it was not "radical" enough - and distanced himself from Ed Miliband, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.  He said disadvantaged people wanted a party that "beats the government".  Delivering his second wide-ranging speech in a week, Mr Jarvis told an audience at think-tank Demos: "Let's be frank - New Labour's approach wasn't enough. It didn't get at the root causes.  "New Labour didn't see with sufficient clarity the downsides of globalisation. They knew it meant cheap consumer goods. But they didn't recognise that too often it meant cheap labour too."  However, he urged the party not to abandon its record in government altogether.  "It's a false choice to say we must either champion Labour's record in government or denounce it. The truth is we should defend our achievements and learn from our mistakes. To anyone outside Westminster, that's common sense," he said.  Mr Jarvis, a former member of the Parachute regiment who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, entered Parliament in a by-election in 2011.  He resisted calls to stand in last year's Labour leadership contest, saying he needed to put his young family first (he had recently remarried after losing his first wife to cancer), but later said he regretted not thinking about a bid more.  He is regularly touted as a potential challenger to Jeremy Corbyn - if there is an attempt by the "moderate" wing of the party to oust the Labour leader.  In his speech, he said people left powerless by the actions of the Conservatives "want to vote for a party that doesn't just oppose the government, they want a party that beats the government".  He argued that the next Labour government "must take a more radical economic approach - more radical than we had under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband".  He added: "Put simply, Labour needs to be tough on inequality, tough on the causes of inequality."  And in a swipe at Mr Miliband's general election campaign, he said: "Even when people knew what our policies were they did not trust us to deliver them.  "We were talking a language from another planet."  He stressed the need to invest more in research and development, take a more long-term approach to the economy and encourage unions to "provide education and training to adults wishing to learn new skills".	politics

The data for January from NHS England showed 88.7% of patients were dealt with in four hours. The target is 95%.  That is the worst monthly performance since the target came in in 2004.  NHS England blamed rising demand - overall attendances were up by more than 10% compared with the same time last year. There was also a sharp rise in emergency admissions and calls to NHS 111.  Delays in discharging patients also continue to be a problem. In January there were nearly 160,000 days of delays - the second highest on record.  These are delays patients experience when there are not the services available in the community to release patients despite them being medically fit to leave hospital.  The result is a backlog of patients which has a knock on effect in A&E.  Richard Barker, from NHS England, said: "Against this backdrop it's not surprising hospitals saw a dip in their performance and it is credit to all those working in emergency care that we are still admitting, treating and discharging almost nine in 10 patients within four hours  "Winter pressures have come late this year with a sustained cold period and an increase in seasonal infections."  During January the BBC reported how hospitals were being forced into taking extreme measures to cope.  Some cancelled routine operations en-masse, while there were reports of GPs being advised not to cut back on hospital referrals and emergency treatment areas being set up outside A&E units.  The monthly performance publication also showed the NHS was struggling in other areas:	health

The Commons opposed proposals to allow councils to extend opening hours by 317 votes to 286, as 27 Tories rebelled.  Ministers had sought to limit the rebellion by promising to trial the changes in 12 areas but said afterwards they would respect MPs' views.  Critics of the plans said they would "chip away" at Sunday's special status and put undue pressure on workers.  It is the Conservative government's second defeat in the House of Commons since it was elected last May.  The government had hoped to relax existing restrictions on Sunday trading, which limit large shops to opening for a maximum of six hours, by devolving responsibility to local councils. But their plans were thwarted by an unlikely alliance of Labour, the SNP and Conservative backbenchers.  List of Conservative MPs who voted against the government  Before the vote, ministers indicated they would seek to amend their proposals in the House of Lords if MPs approved them in principle. But while blaming the SNP for the defeat, ministers conceded afterwards the plans would not be resurrected.  "We respect the view of the House of Parliament. The Commons has spoken and given a very clear view - we have to absolutely respect that," said the planning minister Brandon Lewis.  In the biggest proposed shake-up for 20 years, ministers wanted to give the 353 councils in England and 22 in Wales the freedom to determine opening hours for large shops in their area.  During a three-hour debate, a succession of Conservative MPs spoke out against the changes - first announced by Mr Osborne in last year's Budget - and the way they were being introduced.  The reason the government lost by such a margin was not just because of staunch opposition from the Labour Party with its 'Keep Sunday Special' campaign, or the principled opposition from many Tory MPs who believe fervently that Sundays are indeed special and should be protected.  The government also lost because the SNP objected to their plans, even though in Scotland shops have opened for longer on Sundays for many years.  It is an embarrassing defeat for the government and particularly George Osborne, who must deliver the Budget a week today. But the SNP's involvement could have a longer term impact. Read more from Laura  Sir Gerald Howarth said the late offer of concessions had been "shambolic" and looked like they had been "delivered by lastminute.com" while Stewart Jackson said the "dead hand" of the Treasury was responsible for an "egregious and unnecessary confrontation" with Tory backbenchers.  Conservative MP David Burrowes, who tabled the successful rebel amendment, said the government had not made the economic case for such sweeping changes, which he said were opposed by businesses of all sizes, shop workers and faith groups.  Speaking after the vote, he told BBC News of his "relief", adding: "The main thing out there is relief for shop workers, families and businesses who will really be pleased today."  Labour said the government's approach had been "tawdry" and the House of Commons had spoken clearly on the "contentious issue".  The Federation of Small Businesses said the outcome was a "major win" for its members.  "Our members have been unconvinced of the economic case for relaxing Sunday trading rules and there has been no impact assessment to support the proposals," said the group's policy director, Mike Cherry.  "The current system can be seen as a great British compromise which allows families to spend time together, employees to work if they wish to, and provides much needed support for smaller retailers within their communities."  The proposed changes were not covered by new English Votes for English Laws provisions, which require the explicit consent of English and Welsh MPs for measures exclusively affecting them, because other parts of the Enterprise Bill apply to Scotland.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35767948	Government suffers two defeats in Lords on Immigration Bill	The government has twice been defeated in the Lords over its Immigration Bill, shortly after losing a vote in the Commons on Sunday trading.  Peers voted to allow asylum seekers the right to work if their claims have not been processed within six months.  They also voted to allow overseas domestic workers to change employers without risking immediate deportation.  Opponents had argued the latter provision would create "a wide open door to the UK" that could be abused.  Peers voted by 280 votes to 195 in favour of a Labour, Lib Dem and crossbench amendment to the Immigration Bill on the rights of asylum seekers to work.  Lord Alton of Liverpool, who proposed it, said it would end the "enforced workhouse destitution" currently experienced by asylum seekers.  "They are frustrated at being forced to remain idle and survive on benefits," he said.  "How many of us could exist on just over £5 a day while an asylum application was being considered? This is way below the poverty line. Where is the justice and fairness in that?"  At present, asylum seekers are not allowed to work unless they have been waiting for a decision on their case for more than a year - and then only in national shortage occupations.  Lord Alton said 3,500 people had been waiting for six months or more by the end of last year, and they deserved to be able to work rather than "eke out" an existence on "pitiful" state benefits.  He insisted "all the available evidence shows that permission to work does not act as a pull factor for asylum seekers, or migrants."  Arguing against the amendment, crossbench peer Lord Green of Deddington warned reducing the time limit could encourage asylum seekers to "spin out" their cases with appeals.  "Not all people seeking asylum are genuine. The record is that 50% turn out not to be. We should be seeking to reduce pull factors, not increase them," he said.  For the government, Home Office minister Lord Bates said the example of Sweden - where asylum seekers can work as soon as they arrive - showed that greater employment rights "might act as a pull factor".  "We should not be doing anything to encourage more people to risk their lives. Now is not the time to make this change," the minister argued.  The second defeat will give domestic workers the right to change their employer once in the UK and to remain in the country for up to two years after doing so.  At present, changing employers is not allowed, but those in favour of the amendment argued that rule often traps individuals in an abusive workplace, as they fear they will be ordered out of the country if they try to leave.  "The scandal of abuse and exploitation has gone on for too long, sometimes in the most affluent parts of London," crossbencher Lord Hylton said.  Opposing the change, Lord Green said it would mean someone could leave their employer whether they were being ill-treated or not, adding: "It provides what will be seen by many as a wide open door to the UK."  Lord Bates said the government was committed to eradicating modern-day slavery and abuse, but argued the amendment could be open to manipulation by people who had not been placed in difficult situations.  Despite those objections, the amendment was supported by 226 votes to 198.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35762713	'Stunning' operation regenerates eye's lens	A pioneering procedure to regenerate the eye has successfully treated children with cataracts in China.  More than half of all cases of blindness are caused by cataracts - the clouding of the eye's lens.  An implanted lens is normally needed to restore sight, but the operation described in Nature activated stem cells in the eye to grow a new one.  Experts describe the breakthrough as one of the finest achievements in regenerative medicine.  The lens sits just behind the pupil and focuses light onto the retina.  About 20 million people are blind because of cataracts, which become more common with age - although some children are born with them.  Conventional treatment uses ultrasound to soften and break up the lens, which is then flushed out.  An artificial intraocular lens must then be implanted back into the eye, but this can result in complications, particularly in children.  The technique developed by scientists at the Sun Yat-sen University and the University of California, San Diego removes the cloudy cataract from inside the lens via a tiny incision.  Crucially it leaves the outer surface - called the lens capsule - intact.  This structure is lined with lens epithelial stem cells, which normally repair damage.  The scientists hoped that preserving would regenerate the lens.  The team reported that tests on rabbits and monkeys were successful, so the approach was trailed in 12 children.  Within eight months the regenerated lens was back to the same size as a normal.  Dr Kang Zhang, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "This is the first time an entire lens has been regenerated. The children were operated on in China and they continue to be doing very well with normal vision."  It also showed a dramatically lower complication rate "by almost every measure, supporting the superiority of the treatment".  However, he says larger trials are needed before it should become the standard treatment for patients.  The procedure was tried in children because their lens epithelial stem cells are more youthful and more able to regenerate than in older patients.  Yet the overwhelming majority of cataracts are in the elderly.  Dr Zhang says tests have already started on older pairs of eyes and says the early research "looks very encouraging".  Commenting on the findings, Prof Robin Ali from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said the work was "stunning".  He told the BBC News website: "This new approach offers greatly improved prospects for the treatment of paediatric cataracts as it results in regeneration of a normal lens that grows naturally."  He said getting similar results in adults "is likely to be more difficult to achieve" but could "have a major impact".  "It might be superior to the artificial lenses that are currently implanted, as the natural lenses should be able to accommodate looking at different distances more effectively," he added.  Dr Dusko Ilic, a reader in stem cell science at King's College London, said: "The study is one of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine until now.  "It is science at its best."  Dr Zhang believes that targeting stem cells already sitting in the eye could have "great potential" for treating a wide range of diseases from macular degeneration to glaucoma.  A separate study by Osaka University in Japan and Cardiff University, used stem cells to mirror the development of the eye.  They were able to produce a range of specialised eye tissues including those that make the cornea, conjunctiva, lens and retina.  The findings, also published in Nature, showed the lab-grown tissues could restore sight to rabbits with corneal blindness.  One of the researchers, Prof Andrew Quantock, said: "Our work not only holds potential for developing cells for treatment of other areas of the eye, but could set the stage for future human clinical trials of anterior eye transplantation to restore visual function."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35759590	Government facing battle in Sunday trading vote	The government faces possible defeat on plans that could extend Sunday trading hours in England and Wales.  MPs will vote later on handing control of the issue to local councils - which unions and Labour say could extend Sunday opening by up to six hours.  More than 20 Tory MPs are expected to rebel, one saying the shake-up would "chip away" at Sunday's special status.  Ministers have offered concessions, including piloting the changes and an annual review, if MPs agree to them.  If the SNP bands together with Labour and the 20 or more Conservatives backbenchers opposed to the plans it could defeat the government in the Commons vote - expected at around 18:00 GMT.  The SNP had considered abstaining in the vote, as there are no Sunday trading restrictions in Scotland, but now plans to vote against. It claims the plans could hit shop workers' pay in Scotland - a position described as "extraordinary" and "hypocritical" by the government.  In the hope of averting a possible defeat, the government has offered to trial the changes in 12 areas. It says their impact on communities and workers will then be evaluated after a year before MPs decide whether to extend them throughout England and Wales.  An amendment to the Enterprise Bill promising this was not selected for debate by the Commons Speaker, who told MPs that it had been submitted too late, but ministers have said they will table it in the House of Lords in the coming weeks.  Conservative MP for Enfield Southgate, David Burrowes, who is among those planning to vote against the changes, said he was sorry that it had come to this, given that the PM had ruled out changes to existing Sunday laws during the general election campaign.  He said Sunday trading hours were "an issue of conscience" and challenged the need for the shake-up, saying retailers believed "sorting out parking and business rates" was more important for regenerating High Streets.  "Why are we trying to unpick something which is fairly settled?" he said. "There are complex arrangements about Sunday trading and it is a duty on us to look at it carefully, consult on it widely and to scrutinise it fairly. None of those things have happened."  For Labour, shadow business minister Bill Esterson said the government had not made the case for changing the law, and that allowing stores in some areas to open for longer would lead to a "domino effect" elsewhere.  And the SDLP's Mark Durkan said the government's "artist's impression of a flat pack compromise" should not be taken seriously.  However, Conservative MP for Newark, Robert Jenrick, said the public should be trusted to vote with their feet.  "It isn't actually the most complicated decision constituents will make in their lives," he said. "Shouldn't we trust our constituents to make wise decisions for them and their families?"  Planning minister Brandon Lewis said it was "not forcing anyone to shop on a Sunday" but the existing laws were devised "before anyone had heard of Amazon" and he defended the government's right to modernise them.  "Our election manifesto was clear we wanted to see economic growth and the prime minister was very clear at this dispatch box last year that we feel it it is time to review Sunday trading laws in light of how things have moved on," he said.  The BBC's Nick Eardley on the situation in Scotland  There are no specific restrictions in Scotland on when big shops can open - though in some religious communities they don't open on a Sunday.  Historically, many staff have been able to negotiate higher rates of pay for working on Sunday. Not everyone is entitled to this - many younger workers don't get any extra - but the STUC estimates that for a third of retail workers, the premium is worth £1,400.  The SNP says it is concerned those premiums would be eroded if the whole of the UK moves to unrestricted Sunday trading.  But their opponents accuse them of hypocrisy, saying shoppers in England and Wales should be given the same freedom as those in Scotland.  The SNP said some Scottish workers were paid extra for working on Sundays and there were no guarantees these "premium pay" rates, worth thousands of pounds a year, would be protected if hours were extended in other parts of the UK.  "We are relying on guarantees or not from private businesses and that simply doesn't wash when we are talking about the incomes of perhaps a third of retail employees in Scotland," its deputy leader Stewart Hosie said.  The Lib Dems have been given a free vote - with their eight MPs expected to be split 50/50 on the issue.  BBC deputy political editor James Landale said Sunday trading had long been a "toxic" issue for the Conservatives, causing a rare Commons defeat for Margaret Thatcher in 1986, when 72 Tory MPs rebelled against plans to relax restrictions. Read more from James.  Since 1994, small shops - those up to 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft in size - in England and Wales can open when they want to on Sundays but larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.  Ministers want to give the 353 councils in England and 22 in Wales the freedom to determine opening hours in their area.  More than 100 Tory councillors voiced their support for the move urging the government to "help us deliver what is best for our local communities".  But critics argue that family time and other pursuits, including Church going and other forms of religious observance, should be prioritised.  A group of faith leaders, including the Bishop of St Albans, the Archbishop of Wales and the President of the Methodist Conference, have warned the changes will "disrupt the rhythms of community life that are so integral to the common good".	politics

The Sun quotes anonymous sources, one of whom claims to have witnessed a "bust-up" between the Queen and pro-EU former Deputy PM Nick Clegg in 2011.  The palace insisted the Queen was "politically neutral" while Mr Clegg called the story "nonsense".  But the Sun said it stood by its story and would defend itself "vigorously".  All you need to know about the EU referendum  UK and the EU - better off out or in?  Under the headline, "Queen backs Brexit", the Sun said the Queen's exchange with Mr Clegg at a lunch in 2011 left "no room for doubt about her passionate feelings over Europe".  It said her "reprimand" of Mr Clegg "went on for some time and stunned other guests".  The paper says the Queen also revealed her feelings about Europe during a separate conversation with MPs at Buckingham Palace "a few years ago".  It claims the Queen told them: "I don't understand Europe" - words an unnamed parliamentary source says she spoke with "venom and emotion".  Following the complaint the newspaper said: "The Sun stands by its story, which was based upon two impeccable sources and presented in a robust, accessible fashion.  "The Sun will defend this complaint vigorously."  It is unusual for the Queen to take action against a newspaper.  It is a sign of the depth of regal displeasure.  It is the Sun headline, "Queen Backs Brexit" which is both toxic and very troubling to an institution which prides itself on remaining above the political fray.  But the course of action the palace has now embarked upon brings with it risks. It's a far cry from the "never complain, never explain" mantra once deployed by officials in the past.  The letter to the press watchdog ensures that the Sun story continues to be debated.  And there continues to be a focus on what the Queen chose very deliberately to do four days before the Scottish referendum.  When she told a well-wisher in 2014 "I hope people will think very carefully about the future", it was interpreted as support for Scotland remaining within the UK.  It was a planned remark the Queen and her senior advisers may come to regret.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "We can confirm that we have this morning written to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation to register a complaint about the front page story in today's Sun newspaper.  "The complaint relates to Clause One of the Editors' Code of Practice."  The Editors' Code of Practice is regulated by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). Clause One refers to accuracy, saying "the Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text".  It also states "while free to editorialise and campaign, the Press must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact".  The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn wrote that the paper would not have reported the Queen's remarks "had they not come from two different and impeccably placed sources".  He says the Queen must remain "above the fray" of political issues, but added: "If she has a view on Brexit, don't voters have a right to know what it is?"  Professor Vernon Bogdanor, constitutional expert at Kings College London, told the Press Association it was "absurd" that the Queen would break from her tradition of political impartiality after decades as monarch.  "I'm very dubious. The Queen speaks and acts on the advice of ministers," Prof Bogdanor said. "What she said on the Scottish referendum was that people should think carefully before they vote - and that's a very sensible comment, I would have thought."	politics

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said to MPs "we have all been guilty" of leading campaigns against them in the past.  But he said the focus should be on "ensuring everyone is connected to the information super highway".  His comments prompted speculation a law change could be in next week's Budget.  The issue was raised by Conservative MP Andrew Murrison, who said the UK's superfast broadband connectivity was "relatively poor" and businesses in rural areas, in particular, were losing out from patchy coverage.  The PM said the number of homes able to access superfast broadband - defined as providing download speeds in excess of 24 Mbps - had doubled since 2010. But he said more needed to be done, suggesting objections to new masts motivated by so-called Nimbyism had to stop.  "I think this is something for members right across the House. Ten years ago we were all rather guilty of leading campaigns against masts and the rest of it," he said.  "Our constituents now want coverage for the internet, they want coverage for mobile phones.  "We need to make sure we change the law in all the ways necessary to make sure... the masts are built, we increase coverage and we ensure everyone is connected to the information superhighway."  The government says it is on track to meet its goals of providing superfast broadband coverage to 90% of the UK by early 2016 and 95% by December 2017 although critics have accused ministers of moving the targets to guarantee compliance.	politics

"Let us end the process of having people with bigoted religious views treating women as second class citizens," he told Labour MPs  "I think you should all take the pledge - no more segregated meetings," he added.  It follows reports of Labour meetings where Asian men and women have been separated along gender lines.  A Labour Party spokesperson said: "David Cameron is trying to imply that the Labour Party condones segregation.  "This is absolutely untrue. We make sure that everyone is treated equally and respectfully and our record on gender equality speaks for itself."  In May last year, Labour's then deputy leader Harriet Harman told LBC radio she did not "agree" with a Labour rally she had attended in Birmingham where Asian men and women were seated on different sides of the room.  She said it would have better if the meeting had decided to "sit round in a big circle" but she did not "like to be rude" by walking out.  "This meeting was organised by a male Labour councillor and a female Labour councillor, and what they were trying to do is ensure there weren't men-only meetings, which we are even more not in favour of it," she told LBC.  "It was actually bringing the women from the community into the meeting."  At the time the Labour Party said: "There was no forced segregation. Speakers at the event included both women and men."  Labour's current deputy leader Tom Watson, Ms Harman's husband, Labour MP Jack Dromey, and Birmingham MPs Liam Byrne and Khalid Mahmood were also reported to be at the meeting.	politics

The Labour leader said that on his 99 previous questions he has been "unclear or dissatisfied with the answer".  But he pressed on with a crowd sourced inquiry from a "Callum" on cuts to the funding of sixth form and further education colleges.  Mr Cameron disputed Mr Corbyn's claims but congratulated him on reaching "100 not out".  The prime minister said that his survival was welcomed across the House of Commons.  Mr Corbyn has attempted to introduce a less confrontational style, and to ask questions sent in by members of the public, since he took over as Labour leader last September.  BBC analysis shows nearly half of Mr Corbyn's questions have been on welfare or health, with none on immigration.  He asked what is believed to be his first question on the economy at Wednesday's session, saying: "The construction output in Britain has shrunk for two consecutive quarters now, surely this is a matter of concern.  "Isn't this really a bit of a sign that this economic recovery is being constructed on sand?"  The PM said the government wanted "to see every part of our economy growing", but he added: "If you look at our construction plans, because we've got a strong economy we're able to commit to HS2, we're able to commit to the biggest road programme since the 1970s, the largest rail programme since Victorian times, together with huge infrastructure projects in energy and in other areas.  "Those things are only possible because we've got a strong and growing economy."  Mr Cameron warned that Labour would "wreck the country's finances" and put up taxes for low and middle earners.  The Labour leader then accused Mr Cameron of holding back Britain by cutting skills training and investment.  Mr Cameron claimed Labour had created instability in the economy while in government and failed to build enough houses - and disputed Mr Corbyn's figures on apprenticeships, which he claimed had seen a big increase in funding.  In a wide-ranging set of questions, Mr Corbyn also highlighted new figures from children's charities showing council spending on children and young people has been cut by £2bn.  The Labour leader said the reductions came at the same time as Mr Osborne cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the G7.  "Doesn't this demonstrate a wrong choice by the prime minister?" Mr Corbyn asked.  Mr Cameron hit back, accusing Mr Corbyn of making a "political point" instead of acknowledging that corporation tax receipts had increased by 20%, giving the Government more money to spend on services.	politics

There were about 23 conceptions per 1,000 15 to 17-year-old girls in 2014, compared to a high of 55 in 1971, the Office of National Statistics said.  That means that a target, set in 1998 by the then Labour government, to halve teen pregnancies by 2010 has finally been met, six years late.  Alison Hadley, who led the government's strategy, warned the job was not over.  She said it was "an extraordinary achievement", given that many thought the goal was unattainable and high rates were "an intractable part of English life".  Education programmes and easier access to contraception played a part in bringing down rates, even in deprived areas. But she added: "Despite the big reduction, the job is not done.  "England continues to lag behind comparable western European countries, teenagers continues to be at greatest risk of unplanned pregnancy and outcomes for some young parents and their children remain disproportionately poor," she said.  She highlighted the differences between regions, with girls in the north east of England more likely to get pregnant than those living in the South East and South West.  "It is vital to keep a focus on teenage pregnancy to sustain the progress made and narrow inequalities," she said.  "Universal, high quality sex and relationships education, well-publicised, easy-to-use contraceptive and sexual health services, a youth-friendly workforce and good support for young parents, all need to be in place so successive generations of young people have the knowledge, skills and confidence to make choices.  "Disinvestment now risks an upturn in the rates," she added.  Clare Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said shifts in teenage behaviour may also be factors in the falling number of pregnancies, together with better access to contraception and sex education.  "The plummeting level of teenage drinking, for example, may be reducing the likelihood of unprotected sex, and teenagers are also increasingly socialising online, limiting the opportunities for sexual activity," she said.  • The estimated number of conceptions to girls under 18 fell to 22,653 in 2014 compared with 24,306 in 2013, a decrease of 6.8%  • An estimated 4,160 girls under 16 got pregnant in 2014, compared with 4,648 in 2013, a fall of 10%  • There were some 871,038 conceptions to women of all ages in 2014, compared with 872,849 in 2013, a slight decrease of 0.2%  • Conception rates in 2014 increased for women aged 25 and over, and decreased for women under 25	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35755921	Junior doctor strike: Views from the nations	The third junior doctors' strike is under way in England.  The dispute centres on a row over a new contract that the government has said it will impose, and which it says is needed in order to meet its commitment to a seven-day NHS.  Junior doctors argue the contract is unsafe, and does not reward them fairly for working on Saturdays.  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not affected. The BBC's health correspondents in the nations explain why.  And you can read more on the dispute here.  The Scottish government has decided not to introduce a new contract - for now.  It is keeping junior doctors on their old contract because it says there is not enough evidence yet of an increase in deaths at the weekends - and even if there are differences at the weekend, it doesn't believe junior doctors alone can solve that.  It says the whole system needs to change, including access to diagnostic tests and better social support to allow patients to be discharged.  While the row over the new contract rages in England, the Scottish government is hoping that some junior doctors based in England may be tempted to look north for their careers, which could help it address staff shortages.  Either way it's a win-win situation.  If the new contract in England does make a positive difference, Scotland can introduce it later. If it doesn't, the Scottish government has avoided all the controversy and may even benefit with a few more doctors staffing the rotas.  The Welsh government in Cardiff says, for now, it intends to stick with the junior doctors' contract already in force.  But that's not to say that hospital care at evenings and weekends isn't a concern here - with the public service ombudsman for Wales calling for an independent review - sighting several examples of "inadequate care" - including where junior doctors haven't been properly supervised.  The Welsh government says improvements are already under way but it's looking at better weekend access to diagnostic tests, pharmacies and therapies instead of making major changes to work-patterns  Above all, ministers in Cardiff are keen avoid a dispute with frontline staff and say changes can only be made by working alongside health professionals.  But that's not to stay that if big changes eventually occur in England, the Welsh government won't have to consider the implications carefully.  It would arguably be difficult for the NHS on both sides of the border to work with different contracts for staff doing similar jobs.  That's because negotiations between them and the local health minister Simon Hamilton are still going on.  He has said he doesn't want to impose a contract on doctors here - that it would be "the worst possible outcome for everyone".  Mr Jackson is working with the British Medical Association and junior doctors to find a tailored solution for Northern Ireland which is affordable, and has patient safety at its heart.  Junior doctors say they agree that imposing a solution would be devastating.  However, privately some of them are worried that if the discussions don't end up in agreement, a contract could be foisted on them.  But, bear in mind, Northern Ireland is also entering into an election period very soon - it remains to be seen if anyone wants to rock the boat before then.	health

The "learning from mistakes league" rates 120 trusts outstanding or good, 78 with "significant concerns" and 32 with a "poor reporting culture".  Other measures include legal protection for staff who admit mistakes, and new medical examiners to review deaths.  A patient safety charity welcomed the moves but said it remained "concerned".  The first annual "learning from mistakes league" uses feedback from staff on their freedom to speak when things go wrong.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is hosting a "global patient safety summit" in London on Wednesday and Thursday, said the changes were a step towards a "new era of openness".  He said health services must "unshackle ourselves from a quick-fix blame culture and acknowledge that sometimes bad mistakes can be made by good people".  The changes announced by Mr Hunt include:  Peter Walsh, chief executive of patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, welcomed the initiatives but said he remained concerned about the "woeful inconsistency and often inadequate quality of NHS investigations into serious incidents".  He said there was "nothing" in Mr Hunt's announcement to reassure his organisation that urgent action would be taken to address the quality of investigations.  James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died after failings in care, said the measures were "major steps that will help move the NHS towards the kind of true learning culture that other high-risk industries take for granted".  Labour's shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said her party supported "any measures that will improve safety", but she added: "On Jeremy Hunt's watch, hospitals are overcrowded, understaffed and facing financial crisis."	health

James Titcombe said he told staff "several times" at Furness General Hospital that the family had sore throats and headaches.  His son Joshua died in 2008 of an infection, nine days after he was born.  Midwives Catherine McCullough and Gretta Dixon are accused of failing to have his mother Hoa Titcombe assessed.  Mr Titcombe told the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) misconduct hearing in London his wife was "crying her eyes out" because she was worried about the infection.  He said his daughter had also been sent home from nursery because she was poorly, days before Joshua was born and he had a conversation with staff "several" times about his concerns.  "I remember crystal clear telling the midwives we'd been poorly with sore heads and throats", Mr Titcombe said, recalling the day he took his wife to hospital after her waters had broken.  He said they were reassured by staff who said "do not worry", that it was probably a virus and to take paracetamol.  It is alleged Ms Dixon failed to refer Mrs Titcombe to a medical practitioner for an assessment when she was told she had been unwell, on 26 October, 2008.  Ms McCullough faces the same allegation, as well as failing to take a urine sample to test for infection.  An independent inquiry into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust last year found 20 major failures from 2004 to 2013 at Furness General Hospital and concluded there were "lethal failures."

Swansea University analysed data from nearly 360,000 children aged between six and 18 from 2003 to 2013.  George, 20, was put on anti-depressants by his doctor when he was 15, after a five minute consultation. He tells BBC News that they exacerbated the problem.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35756602	Anti-depressants: WHO concern over use by children	A rise in the use of anti-depressant drugs among children is a concern, the World Health Organization has said.  A warning in 2004 brought a fall in use of the drugs, after fears that some could lead to suicidal behaviour.  But a new study shows that between 2005 and 2012 there was a 54% increase in the number of young people prescribed them in the UK.  It also showed rises in Denmark (60%), Germany (49%), the US (26%) and the Netherlands (17%) in the same period.  World Health Organization (WHO) director of mental health Dr Shekhar Saxena said the research, published in the European Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, raises serious questions.  "Anti-depressant use amongst young people is and has been a matter of concern because of two reasons," he said.  "One, are more people being prescribed anti-depressants without sufficient reason? And second, can anti-depressants do any major harm?"  Another concern for the WHO is the prevalence of off-label prescriptions, where children are given drugs which are not licensed for use by under-18s.  Dr Saxena said: "These are medicines which have not been tried amongst young people, have no justification for being used widely in young people.  "There are legal regulations and professional guidelines and off-label use of drugs many times crosses both of them. That's something the World Health Organization is very concerned about."  Anti-depressants are a recognised treatment for managing depression in children but National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines state they should not be offered initially for symptoms of mild depression.  In more serious cases, anti-depressants are only meant to be used in conjunction with psychological therapies.  According to 20-year-old George Watkins, who was prescribed anti-depressants at the age of 15, no other forms or treatment were made available to him.  "My doctor put me on the anti-depressants really after a five-minute consultation," he explained. "I wasn't offered counselling or anything like that, it was straight in."  Five years on, George is still taking anti-depressants despite concerns over their impact on him.  "I was terrified; I still am terrified of medication, because of how bad it has made me feel," he said. "You almost feel forgotten about."  Natasha Devon, the government's mental health champion for England, said there was a real problem with getting young people access to so-called "talking therapies".  "The problem is, of course, is that there is a huge waiting list," she explained. "It's eight weeks if you're lucky, it's far more likely to run into months, so during that interim period all you have are these anti-depressants."  In her work visiting schools she says that she has become aware of increasing numbers of children using anti-depressants, and is concerned that "they can only ever treat the symptoms, they don't get to the root cause of the issue."  Prof Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at health watchdog NICE, said he recognised that accessing child and adolescent mental health services has been a growing problem.  "This may have led to more severe cases of depression in young people being managed in primary care for longer," he said.  He said NICE hoped recent investment in mental health services would increase access to psychological therapies and stressed that "the patient must always be at the centre of care."  According to Dr Rebecca Payne, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, GPs are now abiding by the NICE guidelines, with anti-depressants being prescribed at specialist level.  But she identified pressure on the system in dealing with those with children showing moderate symptoms of depression.  "The mild end the school counsellors pick up," she said. "The more severe end can access specialist psychological and psychiatric help.  "The problem is everybody in the middle, and these are the groups that we might have prescribed anti-depressants to in the past,"  For the World Health Organisztion, the new research, led by Dr Christian Bachmann, needs to act as an alert for countries to look again at how they deal with cases of childhood depression.  Dr Saxena said further studies were needed to look at how and when anti-depressants are being used with children, and for how long.  "There is no reason for many years of prescriptions being continuously given," he says.  "Adolescents and young people are in the phase of development they develop out of everything, including their own depression."	health

After an emergency committee meeting on Tuesday, the UN health agency also said there was increasing evidence of links between Zika and various birth defects.  Zika is most commonly spread by mosquitoes but several countries have reported cases of sexual transmission.  The WHO last month said the outbreak constitutes a global emergency.  WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan said "reports and investigations in several countries strongly suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is more common than previously assumed".  Dr Chan also said that microcephaly - a birth defect strongly linked to the Zika outbreak in Brazil - was just one of several birth abnormalities that the WHO had linked to the virus.  What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread  Key unanswered questions The many things we do not know about Zika  The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect  Another is Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Nine countries have now reported an increase in cases of GBS, a rare condition that can cause temporary paralysis and death.  Dr Chan said problems linked to Zika were now being seen not just in women of child-bearing age, but children, teenagers and older adults.  She said public health officials should not wait for definitive scientific proof of links between the virus and various health conditions before issuing guidance.  The WHO has advised pregnant women to avoid travelling to areas with ongoing Zika outbreaks, and to practice safe sex with anyone who has or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.  "Women who are pregnant in affected countries or travel to these countries are understandably deeply worried," Dr Chan said.  The US is investigating more than a dozen possible cases of Zika in people who may have been infected through sex.  A vaccine for the Zika virus could be ready for human trials later this year, Dr Anthony Fauci, who is leading the US government's research programme, said last week.  Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hopes to start testing a DNA vaccine by September.	health

Proposals to allow English and Welsh councils to permit larger stores to open for more than six hours will not directly affect Scotland, where there are no trading restrictions in place.  But the SNP said it had concerns over the knock-on effects on Scottish pay.  With more than 20 Tory MPs set to rebel, the risk of a government defeat in a vote on Wednesday has increased.  MPs will vote on proposed changes to Sunday trading laws in what would be the biggest shake-up for 20 years.  Senior SNP officials in Westminster met on Tuesday to decide whether to order their 54 MPs to abstain in the vote, effectively allowing the proposals to pass, or to oppose them outright. They have decided to do the latter.  With Labour also opposing the changes and at least 21 Conservative MPs threatening to rebel, the SNP's stance could tip the balance in the vote.  At the moment in England and Wales, small shops - up to 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft in size - can open when they want to on Sundays but larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.  The UK government's plans to give councils the freedom to determine opening hours will not apply directly to Scotland but the SNP has concerns about their impact on existing Sunday wage rates and people who do not want to work.  Stewart Hosie, the SNP's deputy leader, said the UK government had made concessions to protect workers but they did not go far enough in terms of safeguarding the "premium pay" rates he said Scottish workers currently enjoyed, control of which the SNP wants to be devolved.  "Protecting Scottish workers has been paramount to our decision to oppose the government's plans on Sunday Trading," he said. "We have had Sunday Trading in Scotland for some time and the SNP has never been opposed to it.  "However, our concerns here are rooted in the knock-on impact to Scottish workers who would be at risk of pay cuts - many of whom are already suffering from George Osborne's cuts to tax credits and other in-work support.  "SNP MPs have considered all sides in this debate and our decision has been made so workers in Scotland are protected."  The decision was welcomed by unions, which said "common sense had prevailed".  "Shopworkers across the UK will be relieved the SNP have eventually made the right decision to oppose Sunday trading changes that could impact on shop workers pay," said John Hannett, the general secretary of Usdaw.  Asked before the SNP announcement whether it was confident of Commons approval, Downing Street said it was clear about the economic benefits that could result from giving communities the power to determine opening hours.  "We think this is a way to enhance the ability of communities to support their High Streets to deal with some of the pressures that they face from the online market that we have these days and where we haven't updated Sunday trading rules to reflect that," a No 10 spokeswoman said.  Ministers say the change will help High Streets struggling to compete against online retailers and reflects changing leisure and working patterns.  But critics have said Sunday should remain a special day for people to spend with their family or pursuing other activities, including religious observance, free from added commercial pressure. They have expressed concerns that despite promised safeguards, staff will come under increased pressure to work from employers, and pointed out the proposals were not in the Conservatives' election manifesto.  In the run-up to the vote, 21 Conservative MPs signed an amendment to the Enterprise Bill opposing the changes.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warned that the proposals would be the thin end of the wedge and could herald a full "seven-day society".  "If we march through those lobbies together tomorrow with a group of Conservatives who share our views - we will win and we'll keep Sundays as a different day - it's worth fighting for," he said during a visit to east London.  "For those with a strong Christian faith who wish to have a different Sunday I absolutely support them. For those who just want a different day of a week on a Sunday, a day they can get together with family... relaxation time, that's good."	politics

The government was twice defeated in the House of Lords over a £30 a week cut to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for certain claimants.  But it is set to go ahead after peers deferred to the elected Commons.  Ministers claimed "financial privilege" to assert the Commons' right to have the final say on budgetary measures.  Ministers argue the changes will encourage people to get into work, but this is strongly disputed by opponents.  The cuts in weekly support from £103 to £73, contained in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, will apply to new ESA claimants in the work-related activity group, bringing the rate into line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  It will affect people who are deemed unable to work at the moment but capable of making some effort to find employment, including attending work-focused interviews and taking part in training.  Ministers argue that too few people in the category are moving into work and that while the lower benefit rate would save £55m in the first year, £60m would be spent on supporting claimants to take steps towards finding work.  Work and Pensions minister Lord Freud acknowledged peers were only withdrawing their opposition with "great reluctance" after the Commons asserted financial privilege - its right to overrule any Lords proposal that has cost implications.  He insisted that the Lords had "discharged their duty" by scrutinising the bill to remove "unintended consequences" and sending back concerns for the Commons to reconsider.  But Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Grey-Thompson said she was disappointed such a "dreadful and punitive" part of the bill - which has been opposed by more than 30 charities - was going ahead.  "It may be seen as a victory in terms of voting numbers in the Commons but we can't forget there are many disabled people who will lose out," the crossbench peer said.  And Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, the co-chair of Parliament's All Party Disability Group, said she could not believe "the niceties of parliamentary protocol" had been allowed "to trump the lives of disabled people".  The peer, who was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy when she was a baby and has become one of the UK's leading disability rights campaigners, said there was little evidence to back up the government's claims and "environmental and attitudinal discrimination" was the main obstacle holding disabled people back in the workplace.  Disability rights campaigners Scope said the changes would have a "harmful impact" on half a million people.	politics

The 2014 data predates the new limit of 14 units of alcohol per week for men which began in January 2015.  Although habits may start to change, experts say the figures are concerning.  The Chief Medical Officer says there is no safe level of regular drinking.  The ONS figures show 58% of people - 28.9m - drink some alcohol in a typical week.  This figure is lower than a decade ago but has remained stable over the last few years.  Young people are less likely to have consumed alcohol in the last week than those who are older.  Wine (including champagne) is the most popular choice of alcohol.  Of the 2.5 million who bust the weekly alcohol guideline in a single day, the majority were men. The most common age group was 25-44 year olds, closely followed by 45-64 year olds.  The most popular beverage for those who had drunk more than 14 units on their heaviest drinking day was normal strength beer, stout, lager or cider.  Of all those who said they drank alcohol in the last week, the percentage who exceeded the weekly limit in a day was highest in Wales and Scotland.  Jackie Ballard, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said: "Alcohol continues to be the leading risk factor for deaths among both men and women aged 15-49 and is linked to over 60 medical conditions including cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.  "We need to raise awareness of the health harms.  "When it comes to alcohol, there are no safe limits of consumption."  Sarah Toule, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said: "When it comes to cancer prevention, people should avoid alcohol as much as possible as any amount increases the risk of cancer.  "If they are going to drink, it's important not to binge-drink and have no more than seven drinks a week spread over at least three days."  A spokesman from the Portman Group, which represents the drinks industry, said: "The vast majority of adults drink sensibly and safely; part of a decade-long improvement in our relationship with alcohol in this country. Underage drinking, alcohol-related crime and drink driving are also in sustained decline.  "ONS figures are useful in highlighting the specific regions and communities that still need support and the best way to achieve this is through targeted local partnerships between local authorities, health services, businesses and voluntary groups."  Public Health England said it was looking at the best ways to help tackle problem drinking.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35747166	Pop songs 'derogatory about growing old'	Pop records set a bad example by portraying ageing and old people in a negative light, focusing on dying and physical decline, according to a study in a nursing journal.  UK researchers trawled the musical archives from the 1930s to the present day for any tracks mentioning old age.  The majority - 55 out of 76 songs - focused on "bad" aspects of ageing.  The Beatles and Elton John feature on the "negative list", along with Pulp and The Who.  Meanwhile, Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Dusty Springfield were commended by the researchers for penning positive lyrics in their respective songs Forever Young, Borrowed Time and Goin' Back.  Lead researcher Jacinta Kelly, senior lecturer in nursing at Anglia Ruskin University whose work is published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, says popular music is a powerful tool that can influence behaviour and attitudes, and it should be used responsibly.  "For example, The Beatles' When I'm Sixty Four, is generally thought of as an upbeat tune that is quite light-hearted.  "But the lyrics 'when I get older, losing my hair, many years from now, will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greeting, bottle of wine' are actually questioning whether someone who is old is still loveable, and that's concerning."  Likewise, The Who's My Generation song has lyrics saying "I hope I die before I get old", while Pulp's Help The Aged track asks the listener to give the aged hope and comfort "cos they're running out of time".  But Dusty Springfield sings that "growing old is no sin" and John Lennon's song declares "now I am older, ah hah, the future is brighter".  The researchers scanned the Music Lyric Database, Songfacts, The Macronium and Absolute lyrics for English language music texts relating to age and ageing.  Then they categorised the songs they found as either "contented and celebrated aged", "pitiful and petulant pensioners" or "frail and flagging old folks".  Ms Kelly said: "The message coming out of the negative songs is that the elderly are frail and a burden. It's confidence-lowering.  "Music is very pervasive and the message could penetrate.  "While it may prove an impossible task, as well as an infringement on the freedom of expression, to censor negative portrayals of old age, it is important that awareness is raised and some efforts are made to reduce these negative stereotypes."	health

Criminalising cannabis use is a waste of police time, they say, and increases health risks by leaving many people in the dark about what they are taking.  The party is calling for a "regulated market" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.  The Conservatives rejected Lib Dem calls to review drug laws in coalition.  The Lib Dems' attempts to put the issue on the political agenda while in government were rebuffed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who argued existing laws were proving successful in reducing drug use and the harm associated with it.  Cannabis is currently classified as a Class B drug, with possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine. Those supplying or producing cannabis face tougher penalties, with up to a maximum of 14 years in jail.  But the Lib Dems say the existing "war on drugs" has failed, diverting police resources away from tackling organised crime and that people using cannabis should not be "saddled with criminal convictions" for the rest of their lives.  The party has endorsed a new study, written by an independent panel of advisers, which calls for:  The report, whose authors include the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt and Mike Barton, the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, argues that cannabis should be taxed according to its strength and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the Exchequer.  It claims the health risks associated with cannabis use can be more effectively managed and minimised by through a "responsibly regulated market and public health interventions rather than an unregulated criminal market and punitive criminal justice response".  The Lib Dems will decide whether to adopt the proposals as party policy at its Spring Conference this weekend.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, illegal drugs are divided into Class A, B and C. Penalties are most severe for Class A drugs like crack cocaine and heroin, and least severe for Class C drugs like khat and anabolic steroids.  Producing or supplying a Class A drug can be punished with life imprisonment, while there is a 14-year maximum term for Class B and C.  Possession is treated less severely, with maximum sentences of seven, five and two years for Class A, B and C respectively. Warnings and on-the-spot fines are sometimes given for possession of drugs. Read more  "Every year, billions of pounds are put into the pockets of organised criminals selling cannabis, and vast amounts of police time and resources are wasted, going after those using the drug," said its health spokesman Norman Lamb.  "It is not good enough to continue pretending that everything is OK, or that the current system is working. Millions of British citizens are using cannabis with no idea of the potency of what they are taking.  "The current system is doing untold harm: on health grounds and on justice grounds. Leaving the cannabis market in the hands of criminals puts people's health at risk, and criminalises people, blighting their careers."  Steve Rolles, an analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation - who chaired the panel - said the debate was no longer theoretical as cannabis had been legalised for recreational use in a number of US states and that Canada would soon follow suit.  "Over the decades politicians have done great work in cross party settings to explore alternatives to criminalisation and we hope that our report will further assist in taking some of the heat out of the debate," he said.  The Home Office has said it has no plans to change the law, insisting there is "clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health, and harms individuals and communities".	politics

Last summer ministers said they would invest an additional £143m in the services this financial year.  The Mental Health Network suspects the funding has been used to support other NHS services.  NHS England says it can show where the money has been allocated.  The additional funding was part of a £1.25bn investment over five years announced by the chancellor in the budget in March 2015.  While campaigners expected £250m to be made available this year, the Department of Health said in August that only £143m would be spent, as providers did not have the capacity to spend any more.  How the £143m was allocated:  However, the body representing mental health trusts says it has seen little of even that reduced amount.  Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the mental health network which represents NHS providers, said: "Providers of mental health services and most importantly children and families are struggling to see the difference.  "It doesn't seem to have turned into posts on the front line. We are not hearing any reports of any significant investment at a local level around children's services. Indeed some services are still experiencing cuts in services."  NHS England says it has provided £75m to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but NHS providers fear some of the money has been siphoned off to pay for other services.  Acknowledging that is a possibility, CCGs have told BBC News they want NHS England to ring-fence the money, specifically for children's mental health services.  Dr Phil Moore, chairman of the NHS Clinical Commissioners Mental Health Commissioners Network, said: "Despite our commitment to better mental healthcare for young people, it has to be acknowledged that CCGs are dealing with increasingly financially challenging times and a myriad of competing demands on budgets.  "This, combined with the fact that children and young people's mental healthcare is in desperate need of heavy investment having historically been treated as a 'Cinderella service', is why we believe this is a rare case where funding should be ring-fenced."  Some trusts say they have seen additional funding - the South London and Maudsley for instance said they had received an additional £1.8m from four separate CCGs.  And several CCGs told us they were committed to spending the money on new services.  But some children's mental health services are also being cut, especially those provided by councils.  Dr Marc Bush, senior policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: "Our expectation is that overall spending on children's mental health services this year may either be flat or fall slightly in real terms."  Former care minister Norman Lamb, who helped secure the extra funding, is concerned about the lack of progress: "Given the pressure on the whole system including local government, there is a real risk that funding intended for children's mental health ends up elsewhere or simply replaces other funding cuts.  "There is an absolute moral imperative to address the very serious underfunding of children's mental health. Failure to invest this money now would be unforgivable."  An NHS England spokesman said: "As a society we must make sure the most vulnerable children get the very best care as quickly and simply as possible and that they are being offered the right services in the right places. But transformation will not happen overnight.  "Every CCG has worked with local partners including children and young people to deliver plans to improve access to effective services."  The Department for Health said that an additional £250m would be invested in children's mental health services in the next financial year. NHS England says £89m will be allocated to CCGs. But the money has not been ring-fenced.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35743782	How ripple effect of doctor row could be toxic	The ante has certainly been upped in the increasingly acrimonious dispute between junior doctors and the government in England.  Wednesday sees medics stage a walk-out for the third time - with two more stoppages to follow next month - while lawyers prepare a legal challenge to fight the imposition of the new contract.  But while the medical profession busies itself, the government's tactic is relatively simple: it's hoping the whole thing will just go away.  Now that may seem pretty far-fetched given the row has dominated the headlines in recent months.  But there's good reason to think it will succeed. Firstly, the prospect of the judicial review the British Medical Association is pursuing stopping the imposition is, by all accounts, slim.  And with Europe dominating the media's attention, the government's spin doctors seem pretty confident the issue won't be given the airtime it has had to date.  There's also a belief that as the strikes continue and the backlog of patients waiting for operations rises, public support and the appetite of doctors to continue will drop away (in purely financial terms, the next three strikes will hit the pockets of doctors hard as they will each last 48 hours and so mean potentially six days of lost income).  What is more, behind the scenes, efforts are being made to get the other two key pillars of the medical profession onside in the drive for more seven-day services.  An announcement on more support for GPs to help pave the way for seven-day services is expected soon, while renewed attempts are being made to reach an agreement with consultants about weekend working (talks have been going on since the autumn).  Of course, the government's chances of success in both areas is by no means guaranteed. But it's not that much of a stretch of the imagination to see how this dispute could slowly fizzle out bit by bit over the coming months before the new contract starts being rolled out from the summer.  But even if that happens, the government's strategy is incredibly risky.  Why? By winning this battle, ministers could well end up undermining their long-term strategy as the ripple effect of the dispute could be toxic.  It is a point made by Mark Britnell, a man who knows a thing or two about health systems.  He worked in the NHS for 20 years, rising to become one of its most senior executives before leaving in 2009, going on to become head of global health for KPMG.  "It makes no sense," he told me. "Junior doctors will be crucial in making the changes the NHS needs to cope with all the challenges it faces, but they will be demoralised.  "You can't improve services without bringing the staff with you. This could really set the NHS back."  But it is not just about intangible things such as morale and attitude. There is a risk this dispute could have a real impact on the numbers staying in the NHS in England.  Already many junior doctors' posts are not being filled. Last year one in 10 GP trainee posts went unfilled. The situation was little better for A&E and paediatrics.  Even a small increase in these numbers prompted by medics choosing locum work, the pharmaceutical industry or working abroad (or just elsewhere in the UK as the contract is only being introduced in England) has the potential to cause havoc when more and more is being asked of the health service.	health

Cables were at risk of "degrading", some pipe work was 40 years old while the parliamentary estate was rife with asbestos, experts told a committee examining restoration options.  Engineer Nick Mead said relocating MPs and peers during any building work was the "most straightforward" option.  No work is expected before 2020.  The Commons and Lords will have to vote in the next few years on what to do about the state of the 150-year-old Grade I listed building, redesigned in the mid 19th Century by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin following a catastrophic fire.  The Palace of Westminster is partly sinking, much of its fabric outdated, and has been subject to a rolling programme of repairs for decades.  A report published last year concluded that a wholesale restoration of the Palace without moving MPs and peers out would cost £5.7bn and take 32 years. On the other hand, if MP and peers were moved out for six years, the cost would drop to £3.5bn.  MPs and peers looking at the various options available were told on Monday that a huge backlog of maintenance had built up and was unlikely to be cleared if the current programme of continuous repairs continued, another possible outcome.  Many of the building's internal systems had long ago reached the end of their natural lifespan, four leading experts said, while the building had been damaged by climate changes, with rainwater disposal systems struggling to cope with more "intense storm surges".  Mr Mead, president of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, said there was a critical need for the building's electrical and pipe work to be renewed.  Asked what the risks were if comprehensive repairs were not undertaken by 2030, he replied "they would start" with circuits and cables fraying.  "The burnout of a cable may seem insignificant but the consequences are quite major," he said.  "Electrical cables have a life, 15 to 20 years. You have a number of hidden cables. You don't know the state they are in. The worst consequence is a fire and the catastrophic effect of that, given the amount of wood and finishes in this building.  "But there is also the more destructive nature. If you were to lose your power in the middle of a debate or you lost your lighting, the consequences of that. The pipe work is of an age where it corrodes from the inside. You will suddenly get a leak, a loss of heat."  Lynda Jubb, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, estimated the maintenance backlog cost at £2.1bn and said Parliament "had a number of factors working against it in terms of trying to stay on top of the condition".  Asked whether the building could be brought up to scratch without a full or partial evacuation, she said this was "difficult to see".  While there was a "precedent" for MPs and peers moving out to a different location, she acknowledged any such plans would be "very disruptive" and were likely to be met with resistance.  "If this is a life's work, this is a life's work," she said. "I think the original refurbishment took 32 years.  "The problem that Charles Barry had was asking members to move between chambers. I think he had great difficulty in getting space relinquished in order to get work done and that was the primary cause of delay at that time.  "In terms of life safety risk for construction workers, you have to understand that you are asking people to go into spaces where there is asbestos and to work in already difficult and dangerous conditions and also the duty of care that people who are working here have to you.  "That relationship is extremely difficult to manage and the cost of getting it wrong are unconscionable."  Ideas for a new temporary home for MPs and peers include the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre or the Methodist Central Hall, both a few hundred metres from the Palace of Westminster on the other side of Parliament square.  David Cameron has suggested that MPs could move into the Chamber of the House of Lords while work is carried out elsewhere on the estate, as happened between June 1941 and 1950 after the Commons chamber was completely destroyed by German bombing.	politics

Some are worried the chancellor could announce a rise in next week's Budget.  A Treasury minister is to meet fuel campaigners, including the Tory MP Jason McCartney, on Tuesday.  Mr McCartney said he was very concerned and would be urging colleagues to lobby Treasury ministers and officials and is to email every MP warning a rise is rumoured and seeking their opinions.  "We'll be mobilising all the supporters of the Fair Fuel group in Parliament this week," he said.  Treasury minister Damian Hinds is to meet McCartney and representatives from the Fair Fuel UK Campaign at noon on Tuesday.  Another Conservative MP said any rise in duty would be outrageous.  A Sunday Times report that an unnamed minister had said people would hardly notice an extra 2p on petrol has alarmed some backbenchers.  Mr McCartney said: "Me and my Conservative colleagues will really be making the case as strongly as we can this week to Treasury ministers and Treasury officials that we need to continue this good work that we've done."  A Treasury source said reports of a possible rise were speculative.  In an interview with the BBC last month Chancellor George Osborne declined to rule out a rise in fuel duty, but added there was a clear commitment in the Conservative manifesto to help working people.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35726665	How does David Cameron avoid Commons defeats?	Where are the rebellions? Where are the government defeats in the Commons?  When David Cameron formed the first Conservative government since the demise of John Major's in 1997, most observers (me included) thought his narrow Commons majority would spell trouble, not least because a significant number of Tory backbenchers had acquired quite a taste for rebellion during the coalition years.  But so far, barring one admittedly stinging lost amendment on EU referendum purdah rules, there has been no repetition of the prime minister's abject and almost unprecedented humiliation in the 2013 vote on military intervention in Syria.  Even the increasingly snippy Euro-feuding in Tory ranks has not endangered that majority.  There are all kinds of reasons why.  First that majority is over a fragmented opposition; for the government to lose a Commons vote, it must be on an issue that unites Labour and the SNP, at least some of the smaller parties, and a number of Tory dissidents (a task made all the harder by the possibility that Labour MPs could split over a variety of contentious issues - Trident replacement, anyone?).  The Sunday trading vote is a case in point; as I write 22 Conservatives (and rising) have signed a Commons amendment to the Enterprise Bill to strike down the government's proposals to loosen the current restrictions.  But they are more than outweighed by the likely support of the SNP.  The Opposition can't beat the government in the Commons unless almost all its component parties are lined up to vote against it.  Just one opposition-uniting issue (EU purdah) has appeared so far, although next week's vote on Sunday trading and, further down the road, the newly published Investigatory Powers Bill might just provide more.  It's an interesting question how far the dearth of such issues is down to conscious choice.  The 19th Century maxim that Whigs were about legislation and Tories were about administration may be coming back into force; the Cameron government's most contentious actions often seem to be administrative - not needing a Commons vote at all, or perhaps requiring secondary legislation rather than a full-dress bill. It's the hallmark of a very cautious government.  What all this implies is that there are occasions where the smaller parties can exercise considerable leverage.  They can choose their moment carefully, wait until the government is committed to a position and then search their souls and discover a reason not to support it.  Then they can allow themselves to be wooed back into the fold by suitable sweeteners.  Perhaps this is one of the factors behind the government's impending climb-down on cuts to Short Money, likely to be embodied in a resolution of the House next week.  Short Money - named after the former Labour Deputy Leader Ted Short - is the money paid to opposition parties to support their Parliamentary work; the cuts were much resented by the smaller parties and certainly made the government business managers' lives harder.  And at the heart of the government's undefeated Commons record, is the Tory whips office.  Chief Whip Mark Harper ("the best Chief for a generation," one source told me) gets good reviews from some surprising people, for smart judgement of the mood of his Commons flock.  The whips have all kinds of ways of making the lives of errant MPs difficult, and the "usual suspect" rebels may think his punishments of their infractions are heavy-handed - they would, wouldn't they?  But loyalists, especially those who, if you will excuse the mixed metaphor, have to grit their teeth when they toe the line, rather relish the resounding public smack of firm government. A number thoroughly enjoyed the removal of awkward squaddie Chris Chope from a plum role on the Council of Europe.  In the last Parliament the EU was a deadly issue for the Conservative leadership; it was John Barron's precision-targeted amendment to the Queen's Speech regretting the lack of an EU referendum that forced the Conservative leadership into attempting to get a referendum bill through as a Private Members Bill (the Lib Dems vetoed having a full government Bill) and then into the manifesto commitment which led inexorably to the vote due in June.  The leadership may not have liked it, but it produced a position around which the Conservative Party could unify - for the time being.  So in this Parliament, with a referendum legislated for and a date set, there have been few occasions for euro-rebellion.  But what happens after the referendum is anyone's guess.  Acrimony is on the rise in the referendum debate, words are being spoken that will not be easily forgotten, and the prime minister and Mr Harper will doubtless be pondering the exact combination of reconciliation and revenge they should deploy to keep the party together.  They will be helped by the increasing realisation that, given Labour's disarray, the Tories could be in power for quite a while, as long as they avoid civil war.  That message is being whispered into certain ears by a group of Parliamentary patriarchs who retain post-traumatic memories of the Maastricht era and its disastrous impact on the Major government.  As we know, referendums are supposed to settle big questions the parties in parliament cannot resolve for themselves, and settle them for a generation.  And as we also know, it doesn't always work out that way; ask the SNP.  Disappointment is one of the most corrosive emotions in politics, and a close vote to stay in will mean the Euro-pot continues to simmer and may occasionally boil over.  It could provoke a Commons guerrilla campaign by some Conservative Brexiteers, against contentious EU-related measures, but, again, for them to win they would need the support of the mostly pro-EU opposition parties, which looks improbable on most issues.  On the other hand, a vote to leave will overturn the Tory top table, and result in a new leadership, leaving the pro-EU wing with nowhere to go.  It is hard to imagine pro-EU Tories daring to defy a referendum vote to leave, by rebelling on the necessary legislation.  There are many cleaner ways to commit political suicide than that. But a close Remain vote is more dangerous to party unity.	politics

Public Health England's One You campaign is urging the over 40s to drink less, exercise more, eat better and give up smoking.  It is the first national campaign to specifically target this group.  Currently more than two-fifths of those aged 45 to 64 are living with an illness or disability in England.  The campaign will warn those in middle-age that unless they change their ways they could die early or face a retirement blighted with ill-health.  While overall life expectancy has been rising in recent decades, the years people spend in good health has changed little.  But research has shown that living healthy in middle age can double an individual's chances of being healthy at 70.  Analysis: The cost of being unhealthy  To encourage people to change their ways, Public Health England, the government's advisory body, is launching an online lifestyle checker under the One You brand.  It will allow people to answer a series of simple questions about their lifestyle and give them a rating out of 10.  It will then provide them with advice about where they can get help and what they need to do to change their lifestyles.  PHE has also joined force with a number of partners, including the BBC Get Inspired brand, Asda - which will be providing free blood pressure checks - and Slimming World - which is providing discounted access to its schemes.  The campaign will be promoted online, on TV and through a national high street poster campaign.  PHE adviser Prof Sir Muir Gray said: "One you is designed to help every individual identify not only their risks but also the pressures they face in their life and the stress that results and then support them with personalised tools and advice."  England's chief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies urged people to use it as an opportunity to act.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35691579	Victoria Derbyshire breast cancer diary: End of chemotherapy	BBC journalist Victoria Derbyshire has finished the chemotherapy stage of her breast cancer treatment. She describes her emotional reaction to the end of her final cycle.  Derbyshire has been filming diaries since she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of July last year, to try to help demystify the treatment. Her fourth one was recorded across January and February.  Speaking on 21 February, the day before her sixth and final round of chemotherapy she says: "Every day for the past four days I have shed tears, which is really unusual because I haven't much in the past six or seven months at all.  "I think it's because for the whole of this process I've just been concentrating on and focusing on getting through it, taking each day as it comes as much as that is possible, and being pragmatic and cracking on.  "And because it's coming to an end I've been reflecting on what I've experienced, I suppose it's just a release of emotions and a relief. These are actually happy tears because it's going to be over soon."  The following day, as the drugs are administered at the hospital, Derbyshire says it is "great" to think it is the last time she will wear a cold cap. Tightly fitted and so cold it forms ice inside, it is designed to minimise hair loss.  In previous diaries, the presenter has revealed she is wearing a wig but the cap has helped to save about half of her hair.  When a timer rings, alerting staff to the fact the drugs have been administered, Derbyshire says, "That's it, cool," then cries as the nurse removes the IV line from her hand.  Derbyshire then hugs her partner and cries into his shoulder.  Speaking at home later that day she says: "I'm home and I'm happy and I can't stop crying which is mad - I think it might be six months of tears just coming out in one go if that's possible.  "I think when it was over - when the drugs had stopped going into me through the IV drip and the cold cap was coming off - I think I was in shock, I couldn't speak which is not like me.  "I just want to see my boys after school, have a cuddle and a celebratory tea and get on with the rest of my life. I can't stop crying - tears of joy."  In an entry filmed on 2 March, Derbyshire says she has spent a week-and-a-half sleeping, because after six sessions of chemotherapy, "your body craves sleep".  "But psychologically, knowing it's the last time I'll feel shattered or achy or my taste buds aren't right is huge, because if all goes according to plan I will never feel like this again," she says.  "Right now, I'm looking forward to radiotherapy which starts in the middle of April. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to going back to work full time, to feeling normal, to having fun, to spring coming and to getting on with the rest of my life."  Earlier in the diaries, Derbyshire shares her other experiences of treatment.  The fourth round of chemotherapy on 6 January left her "totally wiped out," she says from bed four days later, causing pains in her back, legs and hips. She later says it was the most difficult round to bounce back from and the most unpleasant in terms of side-effects.  On 1 February, five days after the fifth round, she says extra steroids given to her by her oncologist made a massive difference in terms of managing the pain.  But there has been another side-effect - most of her eyelashes have fallen out.  "For the whole of the week my eyes were streaming, weeping really. The oncologist explained that's because the eyes were compensating for the fact the eyelashes weren't there to stop any bits of dust and grit from getting in," she says.  "I am actually quite sanguine now about any more side-effects, so the eyelashes go, I think, 'Yep, what else have you got, what else do you want to test me with?'"  Derbyshire says she is pleased to be returning to work shortly: "I've been trying to work out why being at work at the moment is making me feel so good - and I suppose it's pretty obvious really, it means I'm not a cancer patient, I don't really think about cancer when I'm at work, I'm a journalist, I'm just getting on with my job."

David Cameron has said he has secured a commitment to exempt the UK from "ever closer union".  But Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr the EU wanted a "superstate into which we would inevitably be dragged".  Instead, he said, the UK had a "once in a lifetime opportunity" to make its own relationships with other nations.  Mr Johnson said the outcome of Mr Cameron's negotiations on EU reform had led to his decision to support a vote to leave in June's referendum.  "We were told were going to get wholesale changes," he said.  "Anybody looking at the agreement that we have before us now would be in no doubt that this is not fundamental reform.  "The next item on the agenda is the further evolution of what was a common market into this superstate into which we would inevitably be dragged."  In February the government announced it had reached a deal to set out the UK's relationship with the EU. The prime minister had wanted an opt-out of the EU's founding ambition to forge an "ever closer union".  The final deal said the UK "is not committed to further political integration into the European Union" and that this would be incorporated into EU treaties.  Asked why he chose to go against his party's leader, Conservative MP Mr Johnson said he had been involved in discussions in the days leading up to the EU summit which finalised the deal.  Government lawyers had said measures to bolster British courts and the House of Commons were not compatible with EU membership, he claimed.  He claimed a "huge intellectual effort" had gone into trying to ensure that UK courts and Parliament could overrule the EU Court of Justice, which interprets EU law and ensures it is applied across all members states.  "The government lawyers just blew up," Mr Johnson said.  "They said this basically voids our obligations under the 1972 European Communities Act. It doesn't work."  He argued: "You cannot express the sovereignty of Parliament and accept the 1972 European Communities Act."  The UK officially became a member of what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, after the passage of the act the previous year.  A Downing Street source said he did not recognise Mr Johnson's description of the run-up to the EU deal.  Labour MP and former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper called the London mayor's comments "wiffle waffle".  She told Sky News: "You've just got an increasingly hysterical battle for the future of the Tory party and they are trying to hijack the future of the country. We cannot let them do that.  "This has got to be about our future as Britain and why we'll be stronger in Europe and not get sucked into a battle between old Etonians about their political parties."  Meanwhile, a BBC survey of grassroots Conservatives pointed to a lack of consensus in the party on what the PM's negotiations with EU leaders had achieved.  Of the 128 Tory constituency chairmen who replied, 54 said they would vote for the UK to leave the EU, while 31 said they would vote for the UK to remain and 42 said they had yet to make up their minds.	politics

"Last parliament we made massive strides on diagnosis rates and research - the global race is now on to find a cure for dementia and I want the UK to win it.  He added: "This parliament I want us to make big progress on the quality of care and treatment. Hospitals can be frightening and confusing places for people with dementia, so our new plan will guarantee them safer seven-day hospital care, as well as tackling unacceptable variations in quality across England through transparent Ofsted-style ratings."  The government has doubled research funding to £60m a year and invested £150m to develop a national Dementia Research Institute to drive forward new treatments.  It is rare to get dementia before 65, according to the Alzheimer's Society.  Between the ages of 65 and 70, one in 50 people have a form of dementia, compared to one in five people over the age of 80, with women more susceptible than men, the charity says.  Early signs of dementia can include repeatedly forgetting names, using repetitive phrases, stuttering and mispronunciation, as well as feelings of confusion in familiar situations.  George McNamara, of the Alzheimer's Society, said it was only right that people in their 40s and 50s should be given information about how to reduce the risk of dementia.  Regular exercise and a healthy, Mediterranean-type diet were "small things that can make a big difference", he told BBC News.  The Alzheimer's Society, which is aiming to stop people with dementia feeling stigmatised, has nearly 1.5 million dementia friends helping to change attitudes and offer help to sufferers across the country.  The charity's chief executive, Jeremy Hughes, said many people with dementia still faced stigma and a health care system that "simply does not work for them - resulting in emergency hospital admissions, extended stays and desperate loneliness".	health

Grubs might not be everyone's idea of a tasty meal but in parts of Central Africa they provide a vital, local source of protein and minerals.  However, as the demand for the critters grows, so are the prices. And there is an environmental impact. Palm weevil grubs live in raffia palms which are being cut down in large numbers.  Now, scientists in Cameroon say they have come up with a solution that not only protects the environment but increases production of the grubs at the same time.  The BBC's Tamasin Ford went to investigate.	health

He discovered a new procedure which counteracts tremors, a main symptom of the disease, and went to meet one of its beneficiaries.  Patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) have small wires inserted into their brains.  A constant electrical pulse is then administered to the organ - which changes brain activity and can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35727244	Peanut allergy theory backed up by new research	The effects of eating peanut products as a baby to avoid the risk of allergy have been backed up by new research.  In 2015, a study claimed early exposure to peanut products could cut the risk of allergy by 80%.  Now researchers say "long-lasting" allergy protection can be sustained - even when the snacks are later avoided for a year.  The New England Journal of Medicine study looked at 550 children deemed prone to developing a peanut allergy.  The latest paper builds on the results of the 2015 research, which was also carried out by King's College London and marked the first time scientists were able to suggest that exposing children to small amounts of peanut snacks could stave off an allergy.  The new study suggests that if a child has consumed peanut snacks within the first 11 months of life, then at the age of five they can afford to stop eating the food entirely for a year, and maintain no allergy.  Lead author Prof Gideon Lack said: "[The research] clearly demonstrates that the majority of infants did in fact remain protected and that the protection was long-lasting."  He said that part of the problem was that people lived in a "culture of food fear".  "I believe that this fear of food allergy has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the food is excluded from the diet and, as a result, the child fails to develop tolerance," he told the BBC News website.  The researchers used the same children who took part in the 2015 study - half of whom had been given peanut snacks as a baby while the remainder had been fed on a diet of breast milk alone.  "The study found that at six years of age, there was no statistically significant increase in allergy after 12 months of avoidance, in those who had consumed peanut during the [2015] trial," the authors said.  The children taking part in the study were considered prone to peanut allergy, because they had already developed eczema as a baby - an early warning sign of allergies.  Prof Lack said that further studies were needed to see if the resistance lasts for considerably longer than the 12-month abstinence period.  He said that in the UK and US combined, 20,000 babies a year are being diagnosed with peanut allergies.  He also said that between 1995 and 2005, the number of people being diagnosed had trebled, and this was not because detection methods had become any more advanced as they had remained the same.  Prof Barry Kay, from Imperial College London, said the study's results "point the way to completely fresh thinking on the mechanisms of tolerance to allergenic foods in 'at risk' infants".  Speaking about both pieces of research Michael Walker, a consultant analyst and medical adviser to the government, said: "Taken together these are reassuring findings that pave the way to stem the epidemic of peanut allergy."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35731925	Week ahead	I'm not sure we're quite into "zombie Parliament" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon.  The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.  Elsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords "ping-pong" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.  Then it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:  In the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the "Work Related Activities Group", and content themselves with a "regret" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another "regret motion" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.  And that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.  He says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.  After that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.  And there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.  There will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.  In Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am). Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.  And at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a £1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a £20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.  In the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.  Then peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.  The sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.  There will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.  The Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's "engine room," followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.  Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.  She has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Lywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.  Then MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.  Labour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.  The day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).  In the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.  There will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).  The Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.  This will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the "check-off" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.  The various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.  Then MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.  The decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.  In the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on "pay to stay" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).  There will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.  The Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.  But the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.  His close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.  For the record, the current batting order is: Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).  There are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.  It's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35660621	The paralysed man who can ride a bike	A man who was paralysed from the chest down after a knife attack in 2010 can now ride an adapted tricycle.  In 2014, surgeons in Poland announced they had reversed Darek Fidyka's paralysis using cells taken from his nose to repair his spinal cord.  The former fireman says he has noticed a gradual return of feeling and muscle control below his injury.  The surgical team are now launching a search for two more paralysed patients who they will try to help walk again.  Mr Fidyka told me: "I can tell that sensation is coming back and I am getting stronger. A year ago I would not have been able to ride a tricycle. Now I can feel each muscle and each press of the foot on the pedals."  The BBC's Panorama told the remarkable story of Darek Fidyka and the 40-year research programme involving scientists in Britain and Poland.  The medical team are now launching the worldwide search as they are looking for patients with an uncommon type of injury, where the spinal cord has been completely severed, which can happen after a knife injury.  The head of the project, surgeon Dr Pawel Tabakow said: "If we can bridge the gap between two spinal cord stumps then there will be no doubt that our technique works and this will be historic - if we succeed we will have found a cure for paralysis.  "Then we will be able to help other patients with the most common type of injury, caused by a crush or compression."  The Walk Again Project will be conducted in Poland, but patients anywhere in the world aged 16-65 will be able to apply via the team's website, which will be officially launched on 8th March in Wroclaw.  All the treatment will be free, but to be eligible patients must have no feeling or voluntary muscle function below the injury and they must be prepared to spend around three years in Poland.  They will undergo extensive physiotherapy before and especially after the transplant surgery.  The medical team are expecting to be inundated with applications in the months ahead.  They will make an initial shortlist based on patient scans and medical notes and then invite a few potential volunteers for assessment in Poland.  Those selected will undergo the same pioneering surgery that was performed on Darek Fidyka which was published in Cell Transplantation.  Scientists have spent decades searching for a means of enabling the paralysed to walk again. Motorised exoskeletons, which are strapped on the body, bypassing the injury, are now available commercially.  Electrical stimulation techniques use implants to enable patients to flex their lower limbs. But neither method involves repairing the damaged spinal cord.  The approach in Poland aims to reconnect the brain with the lower limbs along the neural superhighway that is the spinal cord, enabling both motor control commands to travel down the body and sensation to travel up.  Darek Fidyka's spinal cord had been almost completely severed as a result of a knife attack, apart from a thin thread of external connective tissue and prior to the transplant, he had no feeling or control below his injury.  Now he has had to re-learn how to control his muscles and interpret sensations. He said: "I realise how important the brain is while cycling, and that thinking is more tiring than the exercise itself."  But the results from one patient, however impressive, would never be sufficient evidence on which to base a new approach to spinal cord injury.  The forthcoming trial in Poland will be crucial if the wider scientific community is to be convinced that a patient's own cells can be used to regenerate their spinal cord.  It is also worth stressing that the patients selected will have to show enormous determination if they are to see the full benefits of the treatment.  In the first of two operations, surgeons will remove one of the patient's olfactory bulbs, which sit deep within the nasal cavity at the base of the brain, and process the sense of smell.  The bulb contains specialist cells known as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) which act as a pathway that enables nerve fibres in the olfactory system to continually renew.  In a second operation the patient's OECs will be injected above and below the injury and strips of tissue laid across the gap in the cord.  The team believe the OECs will enable nerve fibres to regenerate across the cord and so repair the damage.  An independent team of assessors led by neurophysiologists from Imperial College London will also be closely involved in monitoring the research.  Peter Ellaway, emeritus professor of physiology, at Imperial said: "I'm excited because this is a novel treatment with a lot of promise."  But he cautioned that even if it works it would take some years to refine and so would not be immediately available for patients.  The treatment in Poland will cost £250,000 per patient and is being funded by a small British charity, the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation (NSIF).  It was founded by chef David Nicholls after his 18-year-old son Daniel was paralysed from the neck down in a swimming accident.  Mr Nicholls said: "I know how important progress is to people living with spinal cord injury and am optimistic that success with the next two patients will result in an announcement that paralysis is curable."  NSIF and the UK Stem Cell Foundation both support the research of Prof Geoff Raisman, chair of neural regeneration at University College London (UCL), who has pioneered the use of OECs to repair the damaged spinal cord and leads the British side of the Walk Again project.  Prof Raisman said: "Darek's latest progress demonstrates the extraordinary power of (neuro) plasticity. But it depends on the patient's own efforts. It is like a baby learning to walk. We cannot teach it how. The progress comes from inside."  Darek underwent his transplant in April 2012, and he still spends five hours a day undergoing physiotherapy.  He can now walk slowly using crutches or a small walking frame, but usually relies on a wheelchair as it is simply quicker and less tiring.  The return of sensation below his injury has brought other benefits like bladder control and the return of sexual function.  Darek was happy to discuss sex and explained that the reawakening of the erogenous zones was a crucial part of his recovery.  He said: "The return of sexual satisfaction - which travels along the spinal cord to the brain - is very important psychologically and is another part of my growing sense of independence."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35731033	Facebook Q&A: Tulip Mazumdar answers your questions on the Zika vaccine	The BBC's Global Health Correspondent Tulip Mazumdar has been investigating a new Zika vaccine which could be ready for human trials later this year.  Tulip has been covering the outbreak over the past few months, reporting on the children born with microcephaly and other birth defects believed to be caused by the virus as well as speaking to scientists who are leading the fight back against Zika.  Many of you got in touch on Facebook to ask Tulip questions about the new vaccine, and when it might be available to pregnant women.  This is an edited version of the Facebook Q&A.  Question from Dawn McLean: Have you tested the vaccine already? How do you know if it works or not?  Tulip answers: Human trials haven't started for the vaccine being developed by the National Institutes of Health - where I have been reporting from this week. They are due to start - assuming no major problems - in the summer/ autumn of this year.  If the vaccine is found to be safe with no concerning side effects, the drug will be given to a larger number of people to test how effective it is and further evaluate its safety. The final phase is giving it to large groups of people to confirm how effective it is.  Question from Priscilla Wakanuma: How possible is it to make a vaccine for this virus?  Tulip replies: Scientists here in Bethesda at the National Institutes of Health think it's very possible. They already have a vaccine for a similar virus - West Nile - which they have been working on.  So they're using some of the tried and tested methods from that to try and develop a vaccine for Zika ASAP.  Taj Rahman asks: The vaccine is available in November, I thought this was a global emergency?  Tulip replies: Hi Taj - getting vaccines ready for market takes years, often decades. They have to go through stringent safety and efficacy trials and then get signed off by a whole load of regulatory bodies.  When the WHO declared this public health emergency last month, one of the key things they highlighted was the urgent need for research into new vaccines. Scientists and pharmaceuticals came together very fast on Ebola, it's hoped that can happen again this time.  But sadly, many more babies are expected to be born with these birth defects in the meantime.  Question from Hannah Borrett: How have they managed to push through the development so quickly?  Tulip replies: You're right, it can take years, decades even to get a new vaccine through all the clinical trials and then signed off through all the various national and international regulatory authorities. But in an emergency - which the Zika outbreak now is - things can be fast-tracked.  A lot more money is put into research, and there's a much bigger political will to get things moving fast.  Take the Ebola outbreak for example, there are now a couple of candidate vaccines that could be used in an outbreak that have shown some efficacy. Research - and cash - for that vaccine was pushed through super quickly.  Adebola Misturah Martins-Bello asks about plans to prioritise who will be considered a priority for the vaccine.  Tulip replies: The plan here at the National Institutes of Health is to have a special focus on protecting pregnant women.  The virus isn't particularly harmful for most people, but the concern is this strongly suspected link to babies of infected mothers being born with under developed brains.  If a link if confirmed, and a vaccine is developed quickly - health authorities will look into whether to add it to childhood vaccines, a bit like the rubella vaccine, which also protects girls/ women if they have babies later in life.

He has also noticed a gradual return of feeling and muscle control below his injury.  The Polish medical team who treated him with a pioneering form of surgery, are now looking for two more paralysed patients with a similar injury to take part in research to see if they have found a way of curing paralysis.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35725744	Zika caught 'killing' brain cells	Zika virus kills the type of tissue found in the developing brain, researchers have shown.  It was able to destroy or disrupt the growth of neural progenitor cells, which build the brain and nervous system, in lab tests.  The discovery, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, adds weight to claims that Zika is causing brain abnormalities in babies.  However, the US researchers caution this is not yet the conclusive link.  There have been more than 4,800 confirmed and suspected cases of babies born with small brains - microcephaly - in Brazil.  It is widely thought that the Zika outbreak is to blame, but this has not been scientifically confirmed.  The team from the Johns Hopkins, Florida State and Emory universities infected a range of tissue samples with Zika virus for two hours and then analysed the samples three days later.  The virus was able to infect up to 90% of neural progenitor cells in a sample leading to nearly a third of cells dying and the growth of the rest being disrupted.  A similar effect in a developing brain could have devastating results.  The virus was able to infect only 10% of other tissue types tested including more advanced brain cells, kidney cells and embryonic stem cells.  Prof Guo-li Ming, one of the researchers, said the findings were significant and represented a first step to understanding the link between microcephaly and Zika.  She told the BBC News website: "Neural progenitor cells are especially vulnerable to the Zika virus.  "They are giving rise to the cortex - the primary part [of the brain] that shows reduced volume in microcephaly.  "But this research does not provide the direct evidence that Zika virus is the cause for microcephaly."  She said studies looking at brain organoids or animal studies were still needed.  In the overcrowded hospitals of Recife, the teeming Brazilian city at the epicentre of the crisis, medics have long assumed that the Zika virus is to blame.  In a sweltering waiting room last month, where anxious mothers were clutching babies with abnormally small heads, Dr Angela Rocha told me that she was convinced of the link.  In a normal year, she said, she might see five suspected cases of microcephaly while in the previous few months she had seen more than 200.  When I asked whether it would be wise to wait for a full scientific analysis with peer-reviewed conclusions, she looked at me with scorn.  With so many cases, and more in prospect after the next rainy season, we do not have time to wait, she said.  It is unclear why these cells should be so vulnerable, but it appears they do not mount an immune response to Zika infection.  While not definitive, the study adds to mounting evidence including Zika being discovered in the brains of dead babies as well as in amniotic fluid.  Brain development researcher Dr Madeline Lancaster, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said the study was a "significant step forward".  She told the BBC News website: "The effect they see could well explain the surge in microcephaly and it opens the door for many further studies into how the virus is affecting stem cells and whether this affects their ability to generate neurons in the developing brain.  "I think it's a very important contribution and is extremely timely."  But she agreed with the researchers that more research was needed to "test whether Zika does indeed affect neuron generation and brain size" as well as how it crosses the placenta.  Dr Bruce Aylward, from the World Health Organization, said the evidence was mounting that Zika was causing microcephaly and another condition - Guillain-Barre syndrome.  He said: "Since the public health emergency of international concern was declared back in February, the evidence that there may be a causal relationship has continued to accumulate."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35724897	Decriminalise 'sex industry', says Jeremy Corbyn	Jeremy Corbyn has attracted criticism from Labour MPs for saying the "sex industry" should be decriminalised.  The Labour leader told students in London he wanted a society "where we don't automatically criminalise people", The Guardian reported.  Ex-Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said prostitution was "exploitation and abuse" not "an industry".  Labour sources said Mr Corbyn had been answering a direct question, not making a policy announcement.  They added that he believed sex workers should not be seen as criminals.  The Labour leader had been taking part in a question and answer session at Goldsmiths University, in London, on Thursday.  According to the Guardian, he said: "I am in favour of decriminalising the sex industry. I don't want people to be criminalised. I want to be [in] a society where we don't automatically criminalise people.  "Let's do things a bit differently and in a bit more civilised way."  In 2014, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to pass legislation making the purchase of sexual services illegal.  In the rest of the UK, paying for sex is not against the law but many activities linked to it, such as brothel-keeping, kerb-crawling and soliciting sex in a public place, are outlawed.  "Man says we should decriminalize a known violence against women. Why did it have to be this man," she wrote.  But the English Collective of Prostitutes, which campaigns for decriminalisation, voiced its support for Mr Corbyn's comments.  Supporters of decriminalisation include Amnesty International, which says it would mean sex workers are "no longer forced to live outside the law".  Ms Harman tweeted: "Prostitution's exploitation and abuse not "work/an industry". Women should be protected and men prosecuted."  An attempt by former Labour Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart to change the law to criminalise paying for sex was defeated in 2014.  Sex workers had criticised the proposal, saying criminalising their clients will make their work more dangerous.	politics

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, hopes to start testing a DNA vaccine by September.  Around 100 Americans have been diagnosed with Zika, after returning from affected countries.  Scientists at the institute helped develop a vaccine for Ebola.  They are now trying to do the same for Zika, with a special focus on pregnant women because of the strongly suspected link between the virus and babies being born with under-developed brains.  Dr Fauci said he's hoping human trials with start in America soon.  "We will have a vaccine ready to go into humans to test - not to distribute - but to test for safety and whether it induces a response that you can predict will be protective.  "That phase 1 trial I believe will likely start towards the end of this summer or early fall"  But phase 1 trials are only the start of potentially lengthy process.  If the outbreak starts to wane, as happened in the advanced stages of the agency's Ebola vaccine trials, it will not be possible to conduct big enough studies to confirm how effective the vaccine is in at risk populations.  The Zika vaccine in development uses synthesised genetic information from the virus, rather than live virus, to trigger an immune response in the body.  So if a person then becomes infected with the virus, their body is already primed to fight it.  Developing new vaccines can take decades. But scientists working at the labs in Maryland believe they can fast track the process because they had already been working on a vaccine for West Nile virus, which is spread by the same aedes aegypti mosquito.  Dr Barney Graham, deputy director of the National Institute of Health Vaccine Research Center, where the vaccine is being developed, said: "The challenge is that we don't know a lot about zika, but we know a lot about other flaviviruses. Zika is one of the flaviviruses."  "Vaccines are generally not made quickly. W still don't have a vaccine for some viruses that have been around for 70 or 80 years."  But he added: "There are new technologies now. DNA vaccines can go quickly, we've done it before for West Nile, for H5N1 (bird flu) for Ebola and HIV"  The vaccine being developed at the NIH in Bethesda, just outside Washington DC is one of two of the most advanced Zika vaccines in develop.  The other is being developed by Bharat Biotech, an Indian company based in Hyderabad.  Dr Fauci said the American vaccine will focus on pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, with a longer-term goal of offering a vaccine to everyone, particularly if that link to microcephaly is confirmed.  He said the world had been in a similar situation in the early 1960, when rubella was causing around 20,000 birth defects a year, after pregnant mothers became infected with the relatively mild German measles infection.  "As soon as we developed a rubella vaccine and started vaccinating everyone when they were children, the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome essentially disappeared.  "This is what we hope will happen with Zika."  However it is already too late for the thousands of babies already thought to be affected by this mysterious virus.  And despite the best efforts of scientists at the NIH, the very earliest a vaccine could be widely distributed is around 2018.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35718491	Scientists 'find cancer's Achilles heel'	Scientists believe they have discovered a way to "steer" the immune system to kill cancers.  Researchers at University College, London have developed a way of finding unique markings within a tumour - its "Achilles heel" - allowing the body to target the disease.  But the personalised method, reported in Science journal, would be expensive and has not yet been tried in patients.  Experts said the idea made sense but could be more complicated in reality.  However, the researchers, whose work was funded by Cancer Research UK, believe their discovery could form the backbone of new treatments and hope to test it in patients within two years.  They believe by analysing the DNA, they'll be able to develop bespoke treatment.  People have tried to steer the immune system to kill tumours before, but cancer vaccines have largely flopped.  One explanation is that they are training the body's own defences to go after the wrong target.  The problem is cancers are not made up of identical cells - they are a heavily mutated, genetic mess and samples at different sites within a tumour can look and behave very differently.  They grow a bit like a tree with core "trunk" mutations, but then mutations that branch off in all directions. It is known as cancer heterogeneity.  The international study developed a way of discovering the "trunk" mutations that change antigens - the proteins that stick out from the surface of cancer cells.  Professor Charles Swanton, from the UCL Cancer Institute, added: "This is exciting. Now we can prioritise and target tumour antigens that are present in every cell - the Achilles heel of these highly complex cancers.  "This is really fascinating and takes personalised medicine to its absolute limit, where each patient would have a unique, bespoke treatment."  There are two approaches being suggested for targeting the trunk mutations.  The first is to develop cancer vaccines for each patient that train the immune system to spot them.  The second is to "fish" for immune cells that already target those mutations and swell their numbers in the lab, and then put them back into the body.  Dr Marco Gerlinger, from the Institute of Cancer Research, said: "This is a very important step and makes us think about heterogeneity as a problem and why this gives cancer this big advantage.  "Targeting trunk mutations makes sense from many points of view, but it is early days and whether it's that simple, I'm not entirely sure.  "Many cancers are not standing still but they keep evolving constantly. These are moving targets which makes it difficult to get them under control.  "Cancers that can change and evolve could lose the initial antigen or maybe come up with smokescreens of other good antigens so that the immune system gets confused."  Harnessing the power of the immune system - what's known as immunotherapy - is the most exciting field in cancer and probably in all of medicine right now.  But while that excitement is justified, claims that a cure for cancer is around the corner are not.  Medical research is littered with the graves of hyped treatments that just never worked.  Two decades ago, gene therapy was "hype-central" and we're still waiting for it to transform medicine.  This study demonstrates some spectacular science that furthers understanding of how the immune system and cancer interact.  But this new knowledge has not been used to treat a single patient. There have not even been animal studies. So there is a real risk it will not work.  Even if it does, this is an hugely expensive approach that would need to be customised to every patient in a process that takes more than a year from start to finish.  Some immunotherapy treatments work spectacularly with some patients' cancer disappearing entirely.  They take the brakes off the immune system, freeing it up to fight cancer.  The researchers hope the combination of removing the immune system's brakes and then taking over the steering wheel, will save lives.  Professor Peter Johnson, from Cancer Research UK, said the research had shown "impressive results in the clinic" and although "the technology is complicated and quite recent... once you start doing it the cost will come down".  Dr Stefan Symeonides, clinician scientist in experimental cancer medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said designing a personalised vaccine was currently impractical, especially when a patient needed treatment straight away.  But he added that the "very elegant" study did provide a ground-breaking insight into current immunotherapy drugs, which do not yet work for most people.  "It's not just the number of antigens, it's how many of the cancer cells have them," he said.  "This data will be quoted in discussions for years, as we try to understand which patients benefit from immunotherapy drugs, which ones don't, and why, so we can improve those therapies."	health

Scenes from a film, depicting rape and murder, were shown to 50 adults. Half spent the next 30 minutes inhaling an equal mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen.  Over the next week, the number of involuntary memories of the film reported by that half declined steeply.  Among the others, the decline was more gradual, Psychological Medicine says.  "The day after they saw the film, the number of intrusions experienced by the group who received nitrous oxide fell by over a half," said lead author Dr Ravi Das.  "By contrast, the decline in intrusions was much slower in the group who received air, where there was not a significant drop in intrusions until the fourth day.  "We think that this is because nitrous oxide disrupts a process that helps permanent memories to form.  "If information is 'important' enough to remember, for instance because it produces a strong emotional response, it is 'tagged' for storage.  "The brain requires N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptors to tag information during the day, which is then filed for long-term storage while we sleep.  "We know that nitrous oxide blocks NMDA receptors, so could interfere with tagging.  "This might explain why the nitrous oxide group seemed to have weaker memories of the film the day after they watched it."  In his 1945 work A History of Western Philosophy, Bertrand Russell wrote: "[The 19th Century US philosopher] William James describes a man who got the experience from laughing gas; whenever he was under its influence, he knew the secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had forgotten it. At last, with immense effort, he wrote down the secret before the vision had faded. When completely recovered, he rushed to see what he had written. It was, 'A smell of petroleum prevails throughout.'"  The study also suggested those who felt more "dissociated" after watching the film scenes tended to experience more frequent distressing memories.  Dissociation is a measure of how detached someone feels from a situation and from themselves, and is assessed through a questionnaire.  These feelings can also induced by inhaling nitrous oxide.  A feeling of dissociation during and after a traumatic event can be a warning sign of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Nitrous oxide is regularly used by paramedics and accident and emergency departments.  Senior author Dr Sunjeev Kamboj said: "Many people who end up in an ambulance will have undergone some form of psychological trauma, and our study suggests that the nitrous oxide is likely to be having some effect on how their brain processes it.  "However, whether it helps to prevent symptoms of PTSD or makes them more likely may depend on how dissociated patients feel before they receive it."  Dr Kamboj said further research was now needed to assess memory effects of other painkillers, such as ketamine.  Laughing gas is often used as a recreational drug, but Dr Kamboj said the amount it took to fill a balloon - the most popular recreational method - would probably be "too small to have a noticeable effect on memory formation".	health

The latest data showed that consumer credit was growing at the fastest pace in a decade.  The consumer boom of recent years, with memories of the financial crash apparently fading, has been well documented.  Not so much has been written or analysed on the impact of debt on people's health. That's what one leading personal finance expert wants to put right.  Martin Lewis, the personal finance expert, has announced the launch of a new think-tank, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute.  He says he has had his own challenges in the past: "Thankfully while I don't have a clinical condition I've suffered from extreme stress at times, with my own dark days, where I've been unable to get out of bed or cope with the world.  "At those moments I was incredibly thankful that I could take time off and still pay the bills without worrying. I set my mind then to trying to do something, in the area where I can have most impact to improve things."  He has a stark assessment of the problem, saying: "Mental health and debt problems are a marriage made in hell."  The new institute will, he says, research new policies aimed at helping people with mental health problems protect themselves from financial struggles and work with banks and regulators to implement change.  There is not a lot of recent data covering the link between consumer finance and mental health.  A study from Psychological Medicine in 2008 suggested that one in two British adults with a debt problem also has a mental health problem.  The Journal of Public Health Medicine published research in 2009 which concluded that one in four British adults with a mental health problem has problem debts, against one in 12 in the general population.  Campaigning charities like Mind say these findings tally with their own assessment of the issues involving debt.  Martin Lewis has revealed quotes from people who came forward after an appeal on Facebook illustrating the link between access to credit and mental wellbeing.  One says: "I have bipolar and was given huge amounts of credit which I spent while on a manic high, I am now in so much debt there's no way out which has an impact on my depression."  Another added: "I used to struggle really hard with finances. When my depression kicked in I would just buy things - I still do now if I have any cash, so it's impossible to save."  So what practical measures might help?  The new institute among other ideas will explore the possibility of voluntary credit freezing for people facing up to mental health issues.  If the card provider noticed unusual spending patterns the card could be blocked assuming the customer had already given authority for such intervention.  A so-called "trusted friend" would be empowered to unblock the card if the customer was felt to be in the right frame of mind to use it.  The banking industry has no objection in principle to such a move. A taskforce, backed by the British Bankers' Association and others, has been set up to look at how more help can be given to vulnerable customers.  An initial report advocates options to "authorise their carers and other people assisting them to help manage their finances and resolve account queries".  There is clearly a will but whether there is a way remains to be seen.  It is understood there are still legal obstacles which might be hard to overcome.  Powers of attorney can be set up under existing legislation but the challenge apparently is to find a more flexible and easier vehicle to allow "trusted friends" to take responsibility for an individual's credit card.  Martin Lewis hopes to make a difference to people affected by the financial consequences of mental illness.  That will be possible if action rather than words follows the launch of his think-tank.	health

The e-borders scheme, launched in 2003, has been dogged by problems and in 2014 was "terminated" in its current form.  The Public Accounts Committee accused officials of complacency and said delays in implementing its successor risked undermining Britain's security.  The Home Office said it was considering the report's findings.  The e-borders scheme is designed to enhance checks on people entering the country by air, rail and sea by gathering and processing data on passengers before they reach the border.  The cross-party committee said the new system was not expected to be in place until "at least" eight years later than planned and cost "significantly more than expected".  It found that repeated warnings about the original e-borders scheme and its successor had not been taken seriously, saying officials had been "worryingly dismissive".  "It is difficult to understand where this confidence comes from, given the lengthy delays and continual warnings of ongoing management issues, which gives us cause for concern about the future prospects for this programme which is vital to national security," its report said.  Seven warnings about the programme had been issued by the Major Projects Authority since 2010 and in 2015 the National Audit Office said checks remained "highly manual and inefficient" and the IT systems were outdated.  The report found that only 86% of those coming to Britain have their data checked ahead of travel, despite a pledge to carry this out on 95% of travellers by December 2010.  Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: "If the Home Office is to complete this project before the decade is out, then it must get its house in order now - starting by setting out exactly what it expects to achieve this year, and who will be held to account for it."  The Home Office said it would respond to the report "in due course".  A spokesman for the department said defending the UK's borders was its "top priority" and "we are investing heavily in our systems to tackle the threat from terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration".  "Every passenger crossing our control points into the UK is checked against a range of watch-lists and the UK passport is among the most secure in the world.  "When the e-borders contract ended in 2010 we took immediate steps to stabilise and modernise crucial but old-fashioned systems.  "This included a £23m investment in new Warnings Index technology, which is now operating at a higher level than ever before."	politics

At present the practice is used only in adults, but researchers say it should be applied to children too.  Their paper is based on a trial of nearly 1,500 children at 14 intensive care units in England.  The researchers said cutting infections would also save the NHS money.  When patients are admitted to intensive care in hospital a tube, called a line or central venous catheter, is inserted into large veins in the body to deliver drugs, food or fluids.  But bacteria are often attracted to these plastic tubes, making them one of the main reasons for infections in the patient's bloodstream.  These infections can lead to damage to the brain and other organs, and cases of septic shock. They can also occur when blood clots form in and around the tube.  In studies on adult patients, coating the catheters both inside and out with low levels of antibiotics or the blood-thinning drug heparin was found to reduce infections by 70-80%.  This study, from the UCL Institute of Child Health, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, is the first to be carried out in children.  It found that only 1% of patients using an antibiotic-coated catheter developed infections in their bloodstream, compared with 4% of patients using a standard tube.  The study called this "a significant decrease" on normal levels of infection in paediatric intensive care units.  Quen Mok, consultant in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital and one of the study authors, said the tubes should now be used on children.  "Bloodstream infections can be dangerous for children who are already very sick.  "They can make conditions worse and even cause death, so ways to reduce the infection risk to our patients in intensive care would be very welcome."  Although the antibiotic-coated catheter was found to reduce infection numbers in children under 16 years old, a catheter coated in a blood-thinning drug showed no signs of cutting infection rates.  And death rates in intensive care were not reduced by the use of antibiotic-coated tubes.  Tubes coated with antibiotic are more expensive than standard tubes but the researchers said adopting them would still prove cost effective because they would result in shorter hospital stays and reduce the costs of treating infections in intensive care.	health

Big banks must "serve the economy not just themselves", the Labour leader told the British Chambers of Commerce.  He also set out his vision for a "new economics", including borrowing to invest in infrastructure and skills.  He said Labour and business should be "natural allies", but warned that firms would need to "put more back into the economy" if it was in power.  Labour has been accused of being anti-business and lacking economic credibility - both under previous leader Ed Miliband's stewardship and now under Mr Corbyn.  Mr Corbyn was addressing the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce for the first time as Leader of the Opposition.  He used his speech to accuse the banking sector of letting down small businesses and consumers and said the banks "drove the economy to the point of collapse" in 2007 and 2008.  The Labour said the political consensus at the time was for "light touch" banking regulation "and sit back and collect the tax revenues".  "But you cannot base a decent social policy on an unsustainable economic policy and we cannot outsource economic policy to the City of London," he said, adding: "That has not served our economy well, and it has not served businesses well."  "The banking sector has to be reformed. Finance must support the economy, not be an extractive industry treating consumers, entrepreneurs and businesses as cash cows," he argued.  Mr Corbyn said a "new ecology of finance" was needed, with more support for credit unions and small businesses.  He called for a national investment bank to target investment "on key public and economic priorities, not just for very quick returns", and "we need to reform the major banks so that they serve the economy not just themselves".  Mr Corbyn also attacked the economic approach pursued by the government, saying the UK economy was "built on sand".  Labour wanted to "break with the failed economic orthodoxy" that had "gripped policy makers for a generation", and prioritise investment.  "We will borrow to invest over a business cycle. We will put public investment in science, technology and green industries of the future front and centre stage," he said.  Setting out his vision, he added: "Only an economy that is run for wealth creators - the technicians, entrepreneurs, designers, shopfloor workers, and the self-employed - and puts in them in the driving seat is going to deliver prosperity for all."  He acknowledged businesses "may not like everything we say" but when it came to "big decisions on the economy, infrastructure, skills and investment, we are actually natural allies because Labour is committed to what is needed for business to expand and succeed".  But he added: "We expect businesses to put more back into the economy but we will do more to give the economy a stronger future."	politics

A Lords committee said it was time to reach a "fair settlement" on the "vexed" issue of party funding.  The Trade Union Bill would require members to opt in to, rather than opt out of, paying a levy to Labour, which fears it will lose £6m a year.  The government said peers had endorsed the plan for a union opt-in levy.  The Lords committee was set up to examine the Trade Union Bill proposals after peers defeated the government and backed a call by Labour - which opposes the plans - for further scrutiny.  Conservative and Lib Dem peers have also suggested the government should rethink its proposals.  The bill, which is going through Parliament, would require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted.  But the committee said the changes would hit union political funds in general, and Labour in particular - which is said to receive 20% of its core funding from unions.  Labour is also reported to be set to lose out on £1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut.  The committee proposed several changes to the government's plans which, it said, would allow it to meet its manifesto pledges "while mitigating the worst impacts on the trade unions and the Labour Party".  The committee did not reach agreement on whether the new system should apply to existing union members.  But committee chairman Lord Burns said: "All members of the committee strongly backed the call for the government to convene cross-party talks as soon as possible, in order to reach a fair and long-lasting settlement to the vexed issue of party funding."  The report warned: "If any government were to use its majority unilaterally to inflict significant damage on the finances of opposition parties, it would risk starting a tit-for-tat conflict which could harm parliamentary democracy."  Responding its findings, employment minister Nick Boles said: "There might be differences of opinion about how and when this should be implemented, but the principle... that union members should make an active and transparent choice to contribute to political funds has been supported by the committee."  Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, hoped the recommendations would "pave the way for a fair, reasonable and lasting agreement on party funding".  She said nothing was being done to address "big donations" to the Tories and accused the government of a "partisan attack on Labour and the trade unions, and by extension democracy itself".  Meanwhile, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said union money "is the most transparent in politics" and the public were more concerned about the influence of the wealthy on politics.  The Electoral Reform Society said welcomed the call for talks on party funding, saying the public wanted to see "real reform" of parties' finances.	politics

The effects of meningococcal infection can be devastating.  In the space of a few hours, the bacterial infection can leave a child fighting for their life in intensive care.  They can be dead within 24 hours.  If it infects the brain and spinal cord to cause meningitis or sepsis (blood poisoning), then even survivors could face life-long disability.  It is something any parent would try to prevent happening to their child, and more than 800,000 people have signed a petition calling for the meningococcal B vaccine to be offered to all children under 11.  It is the most popular petition in parliamentary history because of this picture.  It was shared by Jenny Burdett, whose two-year-old daughter Faye died from the infection last month.  She was too old to get the vaccine, which is given in the first year of life, but only to children born after May 2015.  So why isn't it given to more children?  This is the point where the "heads" can appear heartless - as the answer is mostly about money.  While any child's life is priceless, a publicly funded NHS aims to ensure it spends its money on the treatments that give the most benefit, whether they are cancer drugs, hip operations or vaccines.  And the meningococcal B vaccine is spectacularly expensive because of the complicated way it is manufactured.  The government's expert advisers on vaccines have told the BBC that the evidence was "pretty borderline" for giving the vaccine to anyone and a plan was initially rejected.  It took a cut-price deal arranged between the Department of Health and GlaxoSmithKline for an immunisation programme for the most at-risk age group - the under-ones - to be introduced.  The vaccine is so new that we do not know how many lives are being saved.  The UK is also the only country to have introduced the vaccine, so the whole world is waiting for answers to know how effective this jab is.  We know the programme vaccinates about 700,000 infants each year in an age group that has just over 100 cases and six deaths each year.  Remember, the cost-effectiveness in this high-risk age group was classed as borderline.  Running a catch-up programme for all two-to-10-year-olds (one-year-olds would have been vaccinated in the first year of the immunisation scheme) would require giving two doses of the vaccine to more than five million people.  We know Men B gets rarer as children get older, apart from a teenage blip.  The data on deaths from meningitis B has not been published, but senior figures have told me that fewer than 100 infections would be prevented and about six lives saved.  That is why heads appear to be winning the battle with hearts within government.  And these are not the only costs.  One of the reasons cited for the vaccination programme going ahead in infants was because it could be given during the same appointment as for other childhood immunisations.  A catch-up campaign for under-11s would require extra resources - probably a combination of GP and primary school campaigns.  The closest comparison is the huge effort being made to vaccinate all children between the ages of two and 16 against flu.  But that is taking years to introduce and so far the vaccination has been routinely offered to only two, three and four-year-olds.  The idea of vaccinating under-11s also assumes there are 10 million doses of the vaccine waiting to be given to children.  As anyone who has tried to get the jabs privately knows there is a shortage. The relatively small private market should have new supplies by the summer. Getting millions of jabs would take much longer.  As one official told me: "Even if we had the money, we wouldn't have the vaccine."  Some doctors have also raised concerns about unknown safety risks, as no country has immunised large numbers of people.  Trials on thousands of people have clearly shown the jab is safe, but some side effects appear only after tens or even hundreds of thousands of people are vaccinated.  Narcolepsy induced by the swine flu vaccine or an old rotavirus vaccine and bowel obstructions are two examples of unexpected side effects.  It is another reason there is reluctance to vaccinate millions of children.  But away from the money there are other arguments made for not giving the Men B vaccine to under-11s.  One is that it may be better to vaccinate slightly older children instead.  Teenagers harbour the bacterial infection and unwittingly spread it to children.  Immunising this age group - as happens with Men C - could protect people of other ages too.  Doctors are also more worried about another, even more aggressive, type of meningococcal infection that is spreading rapidly.  Meningococcal infections have natural cycles, becoming more and less common over decades.  At the moment Men B is becoming rarer. In the early 2000s there were more than 1,600 cases in England, compared with about 400 cases in 2014.  But an aggressive strain of Men W is currently spreading - going from 17 to 200 cases in the space of five years.  It is twice as deadly as Men B and is the strain that is causing most alarm and changes to vaccination programmes.  Deciding who should get a Men B jab is an emotive issue.  The evidence will change with time once the data on lives saved by the immunisation programme is published.  And there are discussions about whether the rules on cost-effectiveness do not work for preventing childhood diseases and need to be changed.  But for now there seems little appetite to let hearts rule heads.	health

Pointing to a National Audit Office report, he said a third of families would not now receive it.  David Cameron said the report also said "significant progress" had been made.  He said tax-free childcare changes - also highlighted by Mr Corbyn - had been delayed by two court cases, at Prime Minister's Questions.  Mr Cameron said the new scheme - which was meant to be launched in Autumn 2015 - would now be introduced in 2017.  On the promise to deliver 30 hours of free childcare a week, Mr Cameron said pilot schemes would be launched this year, followed by "full implementation" in 2017.  Mr Corbyn said: "One third of families promised 30 hours of free childcare now won't receive it. This is a broken promise.  "The NAO report also warns that many childcare providers are not offering the new entitlement due to insufficient funding.  "There are 41,000 three-year-olds missing out on free early education as a result of this. Will the prime minister intervene and ensure those children get the start in life they deserve?"  Mr Cameron quoted the NAO report as saying the government had "successfully implemented" the entitlement with "almost universal" take-up of hours offered, with parents and children "clearly benefiting" and providers "positive" about increasing it to 30 hours.  He then made a jibe about Labour's new economic adviser "one Mr Yanis Varoufakis".  "He was the Greek finance minister who left his economy in ruins.  "That is Labour's policy in two words - 'Acropolis now'."  Mr Corbyn said that would not help the thousands of children who were missing out on the free childcare promised by the government.  He then accused the Mr Cameron of presiding over a "crisis" in teacher recruitment and classroom overcrowding - both points denied by Mr Cameron, who said there were "453 fewer schools that were full or over capacity compared to 2010".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35698852	Farm cash delays blamed on 'childish turf war' in Whitehall	Unacceptable behaviour and rows between Whitehall officials have been blamed for delays in subsidies being paid to farmers in England.  The Public Accounts Committee said the Common Agricultural Policy delivery project was beset by a "childish turf war" at cash-strapped farmers' expense.  MPs said the "fiasco" could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions in spiralling costs and EU penalties.  The government said nearly all farmers would be paid by the end of the month.  A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said "the collective focus has always remained on getting payments out to farmers as quickly as possible".  But in a highly critical report published on Wednesday, the cross-party committee found that "repeated failures" meant "many farmers are paid later than in previous years... at a time when they are already suffering financially."  Under the CAP, which is an EU system of subsidies for farmers, about 105,000 payments totalling £1.8bn are paid to English farmers and landowners each year.  But the Public Accounts Committee said the three bodies responsible for handing over the money to UK farmers - the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Rural Payments Agency and the Government Digital Service - had been unable to work together effectively.  "Dysfunctional and inappropriate behaviours amongst senior leaders were inexcusable and deeply damaging to the programme... potentially costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds in financial penalties," it said.  "Highly paid public servants need to get the job done and such behaviour is unacceptable," the report added.  The report said only 38% of payments were made under the Basic Payment Scheme on 1 December 2015 - compared with more than 90% in previous years.  It said in addition to the delayed payments, the cost of the programme had risen by 40% to £215m and penalties from the European Commission were "likely to increase further".  The report also criticised the Government Digital Service's focus on developing an online application system, saying it was "inappropriate for farmers, who have a lower average level of digital literacy", and given the "poor broadband coverage in many rural areas".  In March 2015 online applications were replaced by a "paper-assisted digital system" following repeated IT failures.  The committee concluded that the department should "review its approach to tackling serious failures of management" to ensure it cannot happen again.  It also called for "clear milestones" for when the department expects to pay farmers in future.  Meg Hillier, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, said: "This programme was set up to deliver support to UK farmers. Instead, it delivered an appalling Whitehall fiasco."  She added: "The enduring mental image is of managers, having seemingly lost sight of the purpose of the project, devoting their energies to a childish turf war instead.  "If the department is to build trust in this programme and other projects it first needs to rebuild trust with farmers."  A spokesman for the department said aside from the IT issues in March 2015 "the core of the system has always worked".  "Over 87,000 farmers registered on the system and it has been used to process and pay over 70,800 farmers - over 80% of all those eligible - their 2015 Basic Payment Scheme payment, totalling £1.11bn.  "Almost all farmers in England will be paid by the end of this month and the Rural Payments system has been further improved for 2016 to make it easier for farmers to apply for CAP payments," the spokesman added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35689429	EU referendum: Polls suggest economy is key battleground	Just as we approach the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership of the EU with the polling industry in disarray, following its car crash in 2015, so were the polls in the 1975 European referendum burdened with past failures.  In the 1970 general election, all bar one had predicted the wrong result and their performance in the two 1974 general elections was charitably described as "unhappy".  Why then should we be interested in the latest poll published in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) series? The answer is that here we are dealing with the quality end of polling.  The underperforming polls in the 2015 general election were conducted quickly over a few days and by telephone or via the internet. The BSA poll on attitudes to Europe was conducted face-to-face with 3,000 respondents between July and early November 2015.  Professor John Curtice, who presents the findings, is also able to draw on a great treasury of past data that the BSA has accumulated in its annual surveys stretching back three decades.  The survey suggests that 60% favoured continuing EU membership, compared with 30% who favoured withdrawal. A strong lead, but half the 60% lead for staying registered in 1991. And support for remaining is not unqualified: the survey also found that 43% preferred a looser relationship with the EU than at present - a view shared by 43% of Scots as well.  What are the main pressure points in our current relationship with the EU? The BSA highlights four from the evidence they have gathered:  The survey also suggests that there is also a deeper issue at play in all this. When asked 'How much do you agree or disagree that being a member of the European Union is undermining Britain's distinctive identity?' some 47% agreed, compared with 30% who disagreed.  For many concerned about our national identity, the issue of EU migrants plays an important part in their judgement; 57% of respondents believed immigration would be lower if Britain did leave the EU.  Much of this would seem to offer very fertile territory for those advocating the UK's departure from the European Union. However, this is where things begin to get more complicated. In the face of these significant concerns, why do the same respondents give a 30-point majority to continuing membership? It seems clear that even large dollops of scepticism are not sufficient to persuade enough people that Britain should actually leave the EU.  The missing ingredient in all this appears to be the economy. As the report states: "For scepticism to translate into support for withdrawal, voters need also to be convinced of the economic case for leaving. And at present most are not."  Indeed, only 24% believe that Britain's economy would be better off if Britain left the EU, while as many as 40% feel it would be worse off.  It seems to me that the real battleground in the 2016 EU referendum campaign, the territory where the battle will be won or lost, is to be found in two key statistics identified in the report.  It says: "Only two in five (40%) of those who believe that the EU is undermining Britain's identity but who are not convinced that the economy would be better say that they wish to withdraw from the EU. But that figure is at least double (82%) amongst those whose cultural concern is married with a belief in the economic benefits of withdrawal."  Concerns about the future of the economy played a significant part in the 1975 European referendum as well. In 2016, it seems it may be another case of déjà vu all over again. For scepticism to translate into support for withdrawal, voters need also to be convinced of the economic case for leaving. And at present most are not.	politics

Dr Tom Frieden says this could lead to "thousands" of brain-damaged babies.  Zika has now been reported in 31 countries and territories in the Americas.  So far, Brazil has been the worst hit.  There have been about 100 cases of Zika reported in mainland US.  These were in travellers who had recently returned from Zika-hit countries.  The Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the virus can be found in about a dozen US states, so the mainland is bracing itself for locally transmitted infections very soon.  Southern states such as Florida and Texas are particularly vulnerable.  But Dr Frieden - who is advising the president on this emergency - says Puerto Rico is the biggest concern for the US.  There have been almost 120 cases there so far.  "Close to 90% of adults in Puerto Rico have been infected with dengue [which is transmitted by the same mosquito as Zika]… so we need to do everything possible to reduce the risk to pregnant women there," Dr Frieden says.  Zika is not considered particularly dangerous in most people, but there is a strongly suspected link between the virus and babies being born with under-developed brains.  "This possible or probable association with microcephaly is extraordinarily unusual," says Dr Frieden  "We're not aware of any previous infection spread by mosquitoes that can cause a potentially devastating foetal malformation."  On the frontline of the US' fight against Zika, CDC scientists in Puerto Rico are urgently trying to find new tools to fight these mosquitoes.  The insects have been on the island for many centuries, spreading dengue and, more recently, chikungunya. And they have started to become resistant to the main insecticides used to kill them.  Scientists at the CDC's dengue branch in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, are urgently trying to establish which insecticides are still effective.  They are breeding the Zika-transmitting mosquitoes in their labs to test.  The eggs hatch and then undergo metamorphosis from pupae into adult flying mosquitoes within just a few days.  The mosquitoes live only for a couple of weeks, but that is more than enough time to spread disease, and anxiety.  Worryingly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate them.  "These mosquitoes are resistant to one of the most commonly used insecticides." says lead entomologist Dr Roberto Barrera.  "Permethrin has been used in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Americas for many years, but it doesn't work as well any more."  Dr Barrera's team will report back in the next couple of weeks on what other chemicals can be used.  In the meantime, fumigators go through residential areas spraying entire neighbourhoods with the less effective insecticide.  It is the best health authorities here have right now.  Despite the outbreak, tourism is still strong, with two enormous cruise ships docked in the harbour in old San Juan.  Most people are walking around in shorts and T-shirts, with their arms and legs exposed.  It is only pregnant women who are being advised against travel to Zika-hit areas.  A causative link between Zika and microcephaly has yet to be confirmed.  But until more is known, health officials have to assume there is one.  "There is a lot we don't know," Dr Frieden says.  "If an infant is born to a woman who had Zika, and does not have microcephaly, do they have other problems?  "It may not become apparent for months or years to come."  That uncertainty is constantly on the mind of Joan Ballista, 28.  She is 24 weeks pregnant, and terrified she could become infected - most people who contract the disease do not even know they have it.  She has dropped into a Ministry of Health Women, Infants and Children clinic set up in the city's main shopping centre to give advice to expectant mothers.  "I am very worried" she says.  "I use repellent every day. I put it on when I wake up, when I go to bed. I really worry. Microcephaly is such a sad disease."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35700813	Bernard Jenkin 'reassured' after grilling civil service boss Sir Jeremy Heywood	A leading Conservative MP says he is satisfied with rules on civil servants helping anti EU ministers, after grilling Whitehall's top official.  Bernard Jenkin said he was "reassured" by Sir Jeremy Heywood's answers to his Commons committee.  Sir Jeremy told the MPs the ban only applies to "briefing and speech material supporting the Out position".  Out campaigners had criticised the move, with one minister calling the curbs "unconstitutional".  Also appearing before the Commons Public Administration Committee, the top civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office said the minister in charge of his department might have to use the Freedom of Information Act to get information.  The restrictions were put in place after David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign on either side in the referendum to be held on 23 June.  The government's official position is to remain in the EU.  Sir Jeremy said officials had not been banned from supplying facts to ministers campaigning for an EU exit.  Mr Jenkin, who backs an EU exit, said he had been "reassured" by the cabinet secretary's answers - but his call for Sir Jeremy's original guidance, which had caused the row, to be withdrawn was rejected.  "It was made clear to us that whatever understandings existed before our meeting, it is now not the intention that any facts, information or papers relating to the referendum should be not withheld from dissenting ministers," Mr Jenkin said.  He added: "We do think that this contradicts the cabinet secretary's letter and the Q&A briefing subsequently issued... and we suggested it should be withdrawn and re-issued, but nevertheless we welcome this clarification."  The guidance said ministers opposing the official government position that Britain should remain the EU should not be given access to government papers on the referendum or the prime minister's EU renegotiations.  Asked to clarify what it meant in practice, the cabinet secretary said "pure facts" and statistics would not be withheld from ministers.  "If there is factual material that is generally available in the department - I would have discuss that with the prime minister - but I am pretty sure he would be comfortable about that being shared."  He added: "We are not going to deny ministers information they need to run their departments."  What officials would not be allowed to do would be write speeches, prepare "arguments to use" or "rebuttal points" for ministers to use in the campaign to leave the EU, Sir Jeremy told the committee.  The idea was to prevent ministers from using government resources "to attack the government", he said.  The cabinet secretary said the guidelines were based on those that were used in 1975, when the Labour cabinet was allowed to campaign on different sides in a referendum on whether to remain in the European Economic Community.  Sir Jeremy said he had been "surprised" by the anger the guidelines had caused, adding: "I don't think there is much to see here to be honest."  Earlier, Sir Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, told the committee his boss, Theresa Villiers, might have to use the Freedom of Information Act to to get departmental information.  Ms Villiers is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.  Asked whether he would withhold information from her which may have bearing on the referendum, he said: "Yes. That information is to be used to support the policy of the government of the day."  Ministers campaigning for an EU exit were "operating in a personal capacity and in that respect, if they put in a freedom of information request or a parliamentary question, that will be answered, but they won't be receiving the support of the civil service", added Sir John.  London mayor Boris Johnson, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, has said it would be "obviously wrong" to prevent the public from accessing any information that might inform their decision in the forthcoming EU referendum.  He added: "If there's anything that impedes public access to information about a critical decision that they need to make in a few months' time, then that's obviously wrong."  Asked if Sir Jeremy's advice was unconstitutional, as has been suggested by employment minister Priti Patel, Mr Johnson said: My general view is that we should be as open and transparent as possible and the emphasis, if at all possible, should be to get the public all the information they need to make up their decision."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35698856	Reality Check: What trade benefits could UK keep if it left EU?	The UK's trading partnerships with other countries are governed by a complex set of agreements, which are all negotiated by European Union. Would the UK be able to carry on doing business globally as it does now if it left the EU?  Lord Lawson, former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer and chairman of the Vote Leave campaign group, thinks so.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One on Monday he said that if Britain left the EU: "First of all our trade relations with the rest of the world remain totally unchanged because the European Union did not negotiate as the European Union.  "It's not allowed to, it's not a member of the World Trade Organisation, it negotiated on behalf of the member states. So all our arrangements with the rest of the world remain totally unchanged."  On BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Mandelson, a former EU trade commissioner who is campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, denied this was the case.  So who is right?  There are two types of trade agreement to consider: first, global or multilateral trade agreements done through the World Trade Organisation, the WTO.  In relation to membership of the WTO, Lord Lawson is right. The UK (and the other EU member states) are WTO members in their own right.  The UK is a founder member. The European Commission does negotiate on their behalf in the WTO, on the basis of a negotiating mandate from member states' trade ministers. However, contrary to what Lord Lawson said, the EU is also a member in its own right.  Experts we have consulted think the UK could expect full access to the markets of WTO members on the same terms as other members of the organisation. It is a basic principle of the WTO that trade policy is supposed to be non-discriminatory.  READ MORE: The truth behind claims in the EU debate  However there might be a complicated transition. The British government (which is seeking a Remain vote) put it like this: "In the event that we leave the EU, we would need to update the terms of our WTO membership where the commitments taken have previously applied to the EU as a whole.  "This would not be a straightforward process as, if we leave the EU, then we would need all other WTO members to agree how the UK will take on the rights and obligations which we have formerly taken as a part of the EU.  "This would mean negotiating and agreeing updated UK schedules of commitments with all 161 WTO members.  "And until our schedule of commitments was updated, there could be questions surrounding our rights to access WTO members' markets, and our ability to enforce those rights".  The transition might be somewhat simpler if the UK were to adopt the EU's tariffs and other policies on access to the UK market.  The EU has another group of trade agreements with countries that provide European exporters with better access to their markets - and better access for them to the EU.  There are such agreements with Korea, Mexico and Canada among others and the really big one is being negotiated with the US (the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP).  It is true that these agreements generally list the member states (including the UK) as parties, but all the experts we have contacted say that negotiations will be required if these agreements are to continue providing enhanced market access for the UK business.  It would be open to the other countries to extend their agreements on the same terms to the UK. It would be a matter of their judgement of their own interests and negotiation with the UK. Britain is a large market, though not as large as the EU, so there is a clear incentive for these countries to negotiate.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35701140	Pregnant women warned against Zika travel	Public Health England has strengthened its advice on Zika, saying pregnant women should postpone non-essential travel to areas with disease outbreaks.  Previously it had encouraged expectant mothers to reconsider such travel because of the potential harm the virus might pose to babies in the womb.  If travel is unavoidable, they should take precautions to avoid bites from mosquitoes that spread the disease.  In recent months, Zika has been spreading across much of the Americas.  The infection has been linked to cases of microcephaly - babies born with underdeveloped brains.  In February, the World Health Organization declared the situation a global public health emergency requiring a united response.  Prof Paul Cosford from Public Health England said: "As our knowledge of the Zika virus, and the evidence linking microcephaly to Zika infection, becomes clearer a more precautionary approach is warranted. This advice will be kept under review and updated as more information becomes available.  "We expect to see small numbers of Zika virus infections in travellers returning to the UK, but the risk to the wider population is negligible as the mosquito vector is not found in the UK."  The symptoms of Zika infection may include:  A spokesman for ABTA, the travel association, said pregnant women due to travel to any of the destinations affected should seek medical advice from their GP.  "Where it is necessary to change or cancel their holiday arrangements in light of the NaTHNaC advice, they should request that their GP provides them with a medical certificate in order to assist them with any possible insurance claim.  "Travel companies will try and be as flexible as possible with pregnant customers who had already booked before the advice changed, and many are offering customers the option to amend their holiday to an alternative destination free of charge."

The Britain Stronger in Europe director said ministers opposing the government were fortunate not to be sacked.  Critics say the ban on Leave ministers seeing documents relating to the referendum is "unconstitutional".  Out campaigners said Lord Mandelson had previously been proved wrong in calling for the UK to join the euro.  Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood faces a grilling from MPs later on the rules under which ministers can campaign for either side in the 23 June in-out referendum.  Sir Jeremy, who appears before the Commons Public Administration Committee later, has issued guidance saying ministers opposing the official government line should not be given access to government papers on the referendum or the PM's EU renegotiations - apart from ones they had already seen.  The decision has been criticised by Conservative backbench MPs and pro-EU exit ministers who have said it risks jeopardising the political impartiality of the civil service.  Mr Cameron says the row has "got slightly out of proportion" and the public should focus on the bigger issue of the merits of staying in or leaving.  In a speech in London, Lord Mandelson said the one paper anti-EU ministers could have been expected to get was "their P45".  The Britain Stronger In Europe board member also attacked the case to leave the EU as a "fantasy".  The UK would not be in a position to negotiate a preferential post-exit EU trade deal, he said.  The former EU trade commissioner said: "Brexiters cannot argue that we are weakened in the EU as it is but would suddenly be strong enough to dictate terms if we left.  "For every politician who saw the pragmatic case for dealing with the UK, there would be another who had little doubt that the UK must not be given a quick or easy ride."  He added: "In return for market access, we would be required to continue to accept many EU norms and standards.  "As a result, we would have left the EU in order to assert our national sovereignty only to find that, as a condition of access, we did not have independence from EU regulation after all."  Lord Mandelson claimed a vote to leave would lead to "years of uncertainty" and, "in the worst case scenario, a return to paying EU tariffs" while a final free trade agreement was negotiated.  He said tariffs of up to 20% "or sometimes even more" could be imposed on UK exports, including cars and whisky.  The former Labour minister's claims were dismissed by Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign.  "Peter Mandelson told us the British economy would fall off a cliff if we didn't join the euro and now he is indulging in the same scaremongering about the referendum," he said.  "He was wrong then and he is wrong now. He is starting to resemble a man wearing a sign saying the 'end is nigh'."  Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who is part of Vote Leave, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her party had "stopped thinking about what the European Union really means".  The MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said the "political stability" first offered by European nations joining together was being "seriously questioned" adding that "the European Union as an institution is not responding to it properly".  In the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne told MPs the Treasury would publish "a comprehensive analysis" of the costs and benefits of Britain's EU membership ahead of the referendum.  He said a UK exit from the EU would be "a long, costly, messy divorce".	politics

Last month it launched an inquiry into Tory general election spending in Thanet South following allegations broadcast by Channel 4 News.  It is now also looking at the reporting of hotel bills at the Newark, Rochester and Strood and Clacton by-elections.  The Conservative Party said all spending had been "correctly recorded in accordance with the law".  Strict limits apply to the amount parties and individual candidates can spend fighting elections.  Channel 4 News alleged the Conservative Party's candidate spending returns for the three by-elections were incomplete.  The commission does not have the power to investigate candidate spending, which is the responsibility of the police.  But it can investigate whether the hotel bills were reported in the overall returns for the 2014 European Parliament election and May's general election.  If the Conservative Party did include the hotel bills in its national spending returns it would be up to the police to investigate whether the party should have instead included the bills in the candidate spending returns.  The Commission can sanction a breach of the rules with a fine of up to £20,000.  The Conservatives said: "We will of course cooperate with the Electoral Commission," adding: "All spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics

Hair dyes can cover up greying but gene manipulation may, in future, banish it altogether.  The international team collected DNA samples from "a diverse melting pot" of more than 6,000 volunteers of European, Native American and African ancestry.  It sits on chromosome six and while it is unlikely to be the only gene controlling greying, it provides a new target for researchers.  Lead author Dr Kaustubh Adhikari, from University College London, said: "We already know several genes involved in balding and hair colour but this is the first time a gene for greying has been identified in humans, as well as other genes influencing hair shape and density.  "It was only possible because we analysed a diverse melting pot of people, which hasn't been done before on this scale."  Hair gets its colour from pigments produced by cells called melanocytes that sit in the hair follicle - the root of the hair.  As we age, the melanocytes stop producing the pigments and the hair loses its natural colour and goes grey.  Experts believe there are many genetic as well as some environmental factors involved in this ageing pathway - IRF4 is now an example that we now know about.  As well as the greying gene, the researchers also found a gene linked to monobrows and others linked to beard and eyebrow thickness.  Dr Adhikari said: "The genes we have identified are unlikely to work in isolation to cause greying or straight hair, or thick eyebrows, but have a role to play along with many other factors yet to be identified."	health

With deaths from illegal drugs in England and Wales at the highest rate ever recorded one might imagine the Home Office would be desperate to ensure it had a robust and effective strategy for dealing with this current crisis.  So it comes as a surprise to discover that Ministers have quietly abandoned the idea of a formal consultation process in advance of a new drugs strategy later this month.  Traditionally, these five-year plans are put together after weeks of discussions and submissions from experts and the general public.  In 2010 there were 1,850 responses to the drug strategy consultation, including from health professionals, charities, lobby groups, local authorities, government advisors, police and service providers.  Individuals with a close interest in drug policy, often because of the death of a close relative, were also encouraged to participate.  But not this time.  The new five-year strategy has been written with hardly any public discussion at all. You won't find any details on the Home Office website. Nothing.  It is almost as though the department doesn't want to consider alternative options - which is odd because next month UK ministers will be attending the most important United Nations meeting on global drug strategy for decades.  The UN General Assembly will gather in New York to try and agree a new global drug policy.  It will decide whether the "war on drugs" should be consigned to history and a new people-centred approach adopted. In short, it is reviewing the international treaty obligations that will frame everything this country does on drugs.  So one might have thought ministers would be keen to get the views of everyone touched by drugs policy in Britain as they prepare for this historic United Nations meeting.  I understand that just two meetings specifically about the new UK drugs strategy have been held by the Home Office. They were behind closed doors and there were no votes, no reports and no minutes published.  Around the table were representatives of some of the large organisations that get paid by the government to provide drug treatment. But what about everyone else? Where were the other agencies? Where were the campaigners? Where were the victims?  The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been sent a draft of the new strategy and a response will be published. But members are doubtful as to whether the council's concerns at record levels of drug deaths and "disinvestment" in treatment services will have much effect on minister's minds.  The Cabinet Office recently published its "consultation principles", guidance for Whitehall on what kind of consultation process they should conduct ahead of introducing policy or legislation.  The "governing principle" is that the type and scale of the consultation should be in proportion to the potential impact of the proposal.  One must assume that in having no formal consultation process, the Home Office has decided the new drugs strategy will have little or no impact. Given record numbers of drug-related deaths, with many more people now dying from illicit drug use than in road traffic accidents, this might seem unfortunate.  When I asked the Home Office about all this, their response suggested ministers don't think there is anything to be gained from listening to alternative voices.  "Drugs are illegal where they are harmful to health and society. The UK's approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities, help dependent individuals recover, while ensuring our drugs laws are enforced."  "We are currently developing a refreshed drug strategy in line with this approach - working across government and with our external partners. This includes treatment providers, commissioners, service users and our independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs."  There you have it. Britain doesn't need a "new" drugs strategy. It just needs to "refresh" the old one - presumably because ministers believe the current approach is operating well.  The Home Office puts out the same line whenever asked about alternative approaches: "Our drugs strategy is working and there is a long-term downward trend in drug misuse in the UK".  But while the second half of the sentence is true, there must be questions about the first half. On an average day, coroners now examine six corpses where cause of death could be described as the failure of the UK's drugs strategy.	politics

The commission "has today begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England". (Separate commissions will be doing the same job for the other parts of the UK).  This sounds like - and, for the commission, is - a technical exercise, but the political effects will be far-reaching.  Boundary changes happen roughly every decade, but this is likely to result in the biggest shake-up of our political map in anyone's lifetime.  First, it is trying to ensure each of our votes has the same value in choosing an MP.  At the moment, voter numbers vary wildly, from 21,769 in the Western Isles (Na h-Eileanan Siar) to 108,804 on the Isle of Wight.  The Conservatives feel particularly aggrieved by this, since urban seats tend to have fewer voters, and are more likely to have Labour MPs, which can mean it takes fewer votes to elect a Labour MP than it does a Conservative one (their more suburban and rural seats tending to have bigger populations).  This has been an unintended side-effect of trying to respect both local geography and traditional boundaries.  Parliament says in future constituencies must have 74,769 voters (the number calculated according to the latest UK population). The commission can deviate by up to 5% to take account of geography and tradition, but voter numbers will be the main criteria.  The second change is the next House of Commons will be smaller. Honouring a pledge in the Conservative manifesto, there will be 600 MPs not 650.  In England, that means 501 constituencies, 32 fewer than now.  Take those two changes together, and, as Boundary Commission secretary Sam Hartley says: "These new rules mean that there is likely to be a large degree of change across the country." That is putting it mildly.  The commission had a go at this during the last parliament. Although its review was cancelled after the coalition parties fell out over it, draft proposals were published.  The only way it could make the quota of voters work was by crossing county boundaries and designing some very weird looking seats.  The city centre of Gloucester, for example, would have been combined with the Forest of Dean, and there would have been a new constituency straddling the border between Devon and Cornwall.  Legally, the commission has to ignore the previous maps it drew up, but similar combinations are bound to recur.  Trivial stuff, you may think, but the kind of thing that causes trouble locally.  It will pit local members of the same party against one another - if you're an activist in a safe seat, you won't welcome the threat of it becoming a marginal, requiring more work to defend it.  In the North West of England, there will be seven fewer constituencies in the next parliament.  Unless enough MPs choose to retire, party colleagues whose seats are being merged will fight each other over the nomination.  Dozens of political careers will end prematurely, and it won't be down to the voters. It will be down to party activists.  The changes before the 1997 general election caused particular problems for the Conservatives.  Many Tory MPs became part of what was called "the chicken run", abandoning seats whose new boundaries would make them harder to defend, choosing instead to stand in much friendlier territory.  That won't happen this time, party rules having been changed. In any case, it is not the Tories who are worried about this review. Although a few of them may lose out, the party is expected to benefit as a whole.  To meet the new quota of voters, smaller urban seats will be combined, so there will be fewer seats on which sitting Labour MPs can depend.  Add in the effect of new rules on voter registration, which appear to have resulted in a drop in the number on the electoral register, especially in areas where the population changes a lot, such as inner cities or places with lots of students, and that exacerbates Labour's problem: if you are not registered, you don't appear in the population statistics, so the Boundary Commission can't count you.  And if a constituency is changing significantly, Labour's ruling NEC will order an open selection process for the candidate for the new seat.  Sitting MPs will automatically be included, but their reselection will be far from certain.  This is the opportunity activists who support Jeremy Corbyn have been waiting for, their best to change a parliamentary party far from enamoured of its leader. However, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has denied this will happen.  Even on the present boundaries, Labour would need a 1997-size swing just to scrape into power.  Since then, it has lost all but one of its seats in Scotland. And even if it makes a dramatic recovery, that country will have six fewer constituencies.  This boundary review - conducted entirely impartially but using rules determined by Parliament - could finish off the Labour Party's chances of ever returning to government.  The public will have a say when the initial proposals are published in September, followed by 12 weeks of public consultation, including meetings around the country.  "We will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground," Mr Hartley says.  If you go along, expect to be surrounded by party activists trying to persuade the commission to alter the boundaries differently.  They won't say they are arguing for party advantage - the commission would ignore their ideas if they did - but amid all the talk of tradition, historical character, inviolable natural barriers, they will really be arguing about votes.  Earlier, I wrote the rules were being changed so everyone's vote would count the same. Not on the Isle of Wight, however.  It has too many votes for one constituency, too few for two.  So one of them would have to be shared with part of Hampshire. Faced with a Conservative rebellion during the legislation's passage, the government agreed to exempt the Isle of Wight.  Its two MPs will each represent 52,724 voters. All are equal; it's just that some are more equal than others.	politics

Clinicians, designers and technology experts will work together to create the "healthy new towns".  Plans include homes with virtual access to GP services, "dementia-friendly" streets, safe green spaces to play and fast-food-free zones around schools.  The money to build the developments will come from council budgets and private partners rather than the NHS.  Some of the developments are already being built, but others will not be completed until 2030.  NHS boss Simon Stevens said a much-needed push to kick-start affordable housing across England had created a "golden opportunity" for the NHS to help town planners promote health and keep people living independently.  "As these new neighbourhoods and towns are built, we'll kick ourselves if in 10 years' time we look back having missed the opportunity to 'design out' the obesogenic environment, and 'design in' health and wellbeing," he said.  "We want children to have places where they want to play with friends and can safely walk or cycle to school - rather than just exercising their fingers on video games."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35689738	Study shows Zika 'might cause' Guillain-Barré syndrome	New research gives the first evidence that Zika virus might cause a severe neurological disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome.  The study was carried out using blood samples from 42 patients who became ill in a previous outbreak.  The Lancet authors say they developed the neurological problems around six days after Zika infection.  Leading scientists described the study as "compelling".  Zika was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in early February.  The virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, has caused alarm in central and south America because of its suspected links to under-developed brains in babies - a condition called microcephaly.  But experts have also questioned whether Zika might be linked to another medical condition as well.  Guillain-Barré syndrome leads to muscle weakness and, in severe cases, breathing problems requiring intensive care.  It is a rare response to infection, which sees the immune system attacking peripheral nerves.  Researchers analysed the blood of patients who developed the disorder during a Zika outbreak in the Pacific island of French Polynesia two years ago.  From this work, they predict there could be one case of Guillain-Barré among every 4,000 people falling ill with Zika.  The lead author Professor Arnaud Fontanet, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said: "These patients tended to deteriorate more rapidly than we usually see with Guillain-Barré.  "But once they were over the acute phase of the illness, their recovery tended to be better."  None of the 42 patients died but some still needed help walking, several months after they became ill.  The researchers say countries with Zika should prepare for extra cases of the nerve disorder.  Professor Hugh Willison, from Glasgow University, told BBC News: "On an individual level, we shouldn't be frightening people into thinking that if they get Zika infection they'll automatically get Guillain-Barré - because the risk is actually rather low.  "But if a million people get infected with Zika, that's hundreds of unexpected cases of Guillain-Barré."  Figures from the WHO show that Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Surinam and Venezuela have all reported increased numbers of cases of the syndrome in recent weeks.  Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "This study provides the most compelling evidence to date of a causative link between Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  "The increase in reported cases seems to suggest that a similar situation may be occurring in the current outbreak, although the link here is yet to be proven definitively.  "The scale of the crisis unfolding in Latin America has taken us all by surprise, and we should be prepared for further unforeseen complications of Zika virus infection to emerge in the coming weeks and months."	health

Peers voted by 286 to 219 to delay the cuts, pending an assessment of the impact on claimants.  In January the Lords voted to remove the cuts from the Welfare Reform Bill altogether, but they were later reinstated by MPs in a Commons vote.  Ministers may try to overturn the fresh defeat at a later date.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "The vote in the House of Lords is a routine part of the legislative process and next steps will be announced in due course."  This stage in a bill's journey is known as "parliamentary ping pong", when legislation is batted between the two Houses until agreement is reached on its contents.  The government wants to cut Employment Support Allowance by £30 a week to encourage some new claimants to return to work.  In a bid to stave off another defeat over the plans, Work and Pensions Minister Lord Freud offered several concessions and warned peers against supporting the "wrecking amendment" which he said "undermines conventional parliamentary process".  But crossbench peer Lord Low - who put forward the successful amendment - said the cut in support to disability benefit claimants was "drastic" - and the concessions were "just not enough".  He said the government had not been able to provide evidence for its argument that the cuts "incentivised" people back to work and insisted his "moderate" amendment would give ministers time to justify the policy.  The decision by peers to inflict defeat on the government sets up another showdown between the Commons and the Lords, coming not long after last year's clash over tax credits, which led to moves by ministers to limit the powers of the Lords.	politics

But the regulator said spending on market research and "unsolicited material" for voters went up.  It said the changes might be down to a move away from traditional campaigning to a more targeted, online approach.  General levels of spending were similar to the 2010 general election.  In its campaign spending report for the 2015 general election, the commission said spending on advertising was £6.9m, compared with £9.2m in 2010, with the amount spent on campaign broadcasts down from £1.5m to £806,000.  At the same time, market research spending went up from £1.8m to £7.6m with unsolicited material up from £12.4m to £15m.  The commission also called for new powers to regulate spending at elections.  Its director of party and election finance Bob Posner said: "The law currently stops short of giving the commission the power to enforce candidates' spending rules and only the police can investigate if there's a problem.

Tens of thousands of NHS nursing and doctor posts are vacant.  The statistics, obtained by the BBC, show the scale of the NHS recruitment crisis.  Health unions blame poor workforce planning, but officials say the NHS has more staff than ever before.  Data from a BBC Freedom of Information request shows that on 1 December 2015, the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland had more than 23,443 nursing vacancies - equivalent to 9% of the workforce.  In comparison, the average vacancy rate across the UK economy from November to January 2016 was 2.7%, according to the Office for National Statistics.  The figures - which include 106 out of 166 trusts and health boards in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - also revealed:  There are many reasons for the large number of vacancies in nursing and doctor posts on hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. One simple reason is that more posts now exist, but the number of trainees has not kept up. In the wake of the 2008 financial crash, nursing places were cut, although they are now on the way back up. The BMA suggests it takes around 15 years between a medical student starting out at university and becoming a consultant so planning the NHS workforce supply and demand is a complicated process with a long lead-in time.  But there are also increasing pressures on the health service right across the UK which the NHS is having to respond to - a growing population that is older and sicker, with more complex health needs. In plain language "complex health needs" means more than one thing going on at a time, so an elderly person might be having to cope with arthritis, diabetes and heart problems. But one other important factor is the "Francis effect" - the report by Sir Robert Francis into the scandal at Stafford Hospital identified a shortage of nurses as a key factor in the poor care of patients. Trusts in England in particular have been under pressure to recruit more staff. But when there is a shortage of qualified nurses they have resorted to expensive agency staff and that in turn has led to a growing financial crisis.  Vacancy rates in Scotland are published quarterly and so comparable figures are not yet available.  In England, many hospitals are having to rely on expensive agency workers to make up the shortfall in staff.  That has been identified as a key factor driving a growing financial crisis within the health service.  One solution to the staff shortage adopted by many trusts is employing doctors and nurses from overseas.  The BBC also asked trusts and health boards across the UK whether they were actively recruiting staff from abroad, and in this case Scottish hospitals were also able to answer.  The figures show more than two-thirds - 69% - of all NHS trusts and health boards are seeking staff overseas.  And in just England and Wales, the figure is nearly three-quarters of all trusts and health boards - 74%.  Some are travelling from as far afield as India and the Philippines.  Maca Fernandez Carro is a nurse who is originally from Bilbao in Spain, but has worked at Royal Bolton Hospital since 2014.  She told BBC Radio 5 live: "There was no opportunities for us back home. The options were having a three-month contract [in Spain], or coming here with a permanent position.  "Nursing is so different back home. When we qualify [in Spain] we are expected to do all the techniques that over here you'd need extra training [for].  "So we do a four-year degree, instead of a three-year one, so we have an extra year in which we train the technical part of nursing.  "Even though we are really under pressure, and really, really stressed - I like working for the NHS."  Matthew Hopkins, who is the chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that employing more agency workers compromised patient safety and care.  "The difficulty with running a relatively high vacancy rate is it does inhibit the ability to provide the best care for our patients," he said.  "We have to supplement our staff with agency workers who are not part of the team on a regular basis and therefore the quality of teamwork, which we know has the biggest impact on patient care and patient safety, is compromised."  Ian Cummings, the chief executive Health Education England, told the same programme the nursing shortage in the NHS had been partly caused by "quality failings" - such as the Mid Staffs scandal.  "The quality failings in the NHS have caused our regulators and hospitals to look very carefully at how many nurses they need to deliver safe and high quality care.  "So the hospitals, for roughly the same number of beds compared to three years ago, now have a need for 24,000 more qualified nurses," he said.  Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association blame poor workforce planning for the problems hospitals are having in finding qualified staff.  Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "Nursing posts are often the first target when savings need to be made, leading the NHS to find itself dangerously short and having to spend more on agency staff and recruitment from other countries."  A spokesman for the doctor's union the BMA - which is currently locked in a dispute with the government in England over a new contract for junior doctors - said: "Poor workforce planning means we aren't producing enough doctors and sending them to the right areas," he said.  However, in a statement, the Department of Health in England said: "Staffing is a priority — that's why there are already over 29,600 extra clinical staff, including more than 10,600 additional doctors and more than 10,600 additional nurses on our wards since May 2010."  But the statement also acknowledged that "much more needs to be done", and said the government was "changing student nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals funding to create up to 10,000 more training places by the end of this Parliament."  A Welsh Government spokesperson said: "There are now more doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics and dental staff working in the Welsh NHS today than there were 10 years ago.  "We will continue to do all we can to support recruitment initiatives proposed by health boards and trusts and to address recruitment and retention at a national level."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35640394	Lord Kinnock: Corbyn must back Trident to avoid defeat	Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has issued a stark warning to Jeremy Corbyn that if he continues to oppose the renewal of the Trident missile system, Labour will lose the next election.  Lord Kinnock told me in an interview for BBC Radio 4's Analysis programme that to have any chance of winning, Mr Corbyn will have to stick with the present policy of multilateral nuclear disarmament.  "No party can win a national United Kingdom election if it sustains a stance which means unilateral nuclear disarmament," he said.  The former cabinet minister Peter Mandelson also claimed that for Labour to switch back to a unilateral policy would be electoral suicide.  "The British public have never been and are never going to be unilateral nuclear disarmers. It is just something that you could never sign them up for," Lord Mandelson told me.  Labour's present multilateral policy goes back nearly 30 years. The party lost to Mrs Thatcher's Conservatives in two landslide elections in 1983 and 1987 supporting a non-nuclear policy which many believe contributed to its defeat.  Apart from Neil Kinnock and the party's communications director Mr Mandelson, one of those who engineered the policy change after the 1987 election was the party's defence spokesman, Martin O'Neill.  He is also convinced that if the present Labour review comes out in favour of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's position, Labour cannot win the next election.  Lord O'Neill told me: "The Labour part of the British electorate, albeit declining, is still in favour of multilateralism."  He is unimpressed by the argument that if Mr Corbyn changes his mind after a lifetime's support for CND it will tarnish his vote-winning image as an "authentic" politician who does not compromise. Lord O'Neill argues this is to confuse integrity with obstinacy.  A nuclear fault line has cut through the party ever since the post-war Labour prime minister Clement Attlee decided that Britain should construct its own, independent nuclear deterrent.  The decision was never discussed by the full cabinet and that is a precedent which has been followed by Labour prime ministers whenever confronted with a serious split over nuclear weapons.  It was not until 1983, under the leadership of one of the founders of CND, Michael Foot, that the party went into an election in support of unilateral disarmament, ready to do away entirely with nuclear weapons.  Under Neil Kinnock, in the following election in 1987, which again produced a Tory landslide, this was still Labour's defence policy. It was only 18 months after this defeat, with Peter Mandelson now firmly established as Labour's chief spin doctor, that the policy was finally changed.  To my surprise, Lord Kinnock revealed that throughout his first election campaign as Labour leader he was uncomfortable with the party's anti-nuclear policy. It seems he had wanted to change tack long before the 1987 election.  Lord Kinnock told me: "From the early 1980s really, I'd recognised the unsustainability of the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy, and I was in the very uncomfortable position of having to try to sustain it."  He admits that he decided to make the U-turn in large part because of Labour's electoral position. He is convinced that Mr Corbyn should follow in his footsteps.  "I am not looking for anyone to blame," he says. "I am seeking the exercise of the skills of leadership, and they do require a combination of strength and assertiveness, because parties that are ill-disciplined simply don't enjoy the confidence and support of the electorate."  In contrast, one of those involved in Labour's current policy review, Ken Livingstone, strongly backs Mr Corbyn's position. He is convinced that a majority of Labour MPs will support him over giving up nuclear weapons.  But Mr Livingstone argues that when renewal of Trident comes up in the Commons, Labour MPs should be allowed a free vote, and not forced to follow the leadership line. "This is not the New Labour era of Blair and Brown where people are intimidated and threatened," he told the programme.  All this, of course, is music to Conservative ears; to have the main opposition party badly split over a fundamental policy issue is just what they need to help counter the effect of their divisions over Europe.  And they hold one of the most important cards: the Tories will decide when the vote on Trident renewal will be held.  It may not be in their interest to do this quickly. David Cameron's referendum campaign will not be helped by highlighting Mr Corbyn's problems. After all, Labour's support for staying in the European Union could be crucial.  But at some point, almost certainly this year, the vote will come and it may not only decide the future of Trident, it could also decide the future of Jeremy Corbyn.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35660333	Tech could offer the NHS 'quick wins'	The relationship between the NHS and information technology has not always been smooth.  But, in this week's Scrubbing Up Dr Rob Watson says we shouldn't give up hope - and there is potential for technology to improve the way the health service works, for doctors and patients.  I couldn't believe it when I first started practising medicine. I'd never seen a fax machine before.  Things didn't get any better: what's a pager? When I made a to-do list at work, it was on a piece of paper kept in my back pocket. I'd draw little squares and fill them in as I completed jobs. Who does that?  At handover, I'd have to frantically scribble details down while the doctor handing over to me told me about the case, listing the tasks while ensuring that I spelled the name correctly - is that really the most efficient way to transfer high-value information?  And when I was on call the bleep would constantly interrupt any conversations, decisions or resuscitations. What if it goes off when you're in the middle of putting in a catheter? You don't answer, of course. So the poor nurse who's trying to contact you has to wait for you to call them back.  Or maybe when you do call back you don't get to the person that bleeped you.  Even if you do, the chances are they won't have the patient details to hand. Or you don't have your list to hand. Or your pen. You left it on the last ward; it fell out of your pocket at that cardiac arrest.  All the time getting interrupted, jobs piling up. Surely it doesn't have to be like this?  Well, maybe not. During my work as co-author on the Nuffield Trust report, Delivering the Benefits of Digital Healthcare, my eyes were opened to another way of doing things.  While technology is not a magic bullet that will obliterate all of the NHS's woes by next Monday, there are some potential "quick wins" - measures that should be quick to implement and could bring real and rapid benefits.  Putting, say a patient's vital signs (such as pulse rate and blood pressure) into an iPad or similar means the software could spot any deterioration in a patient's condition.  If this is the case, a doctor or a senior nurse will be automatically alerted and will receive, directly to their mobile device, the patient's details, location and recent results.  All of this can be sent without the nurse leaving the bedside, allowing them to stay with the patient.  No bleeps. No writing things down (incorrectly). No need to fight for a computer to check some recent blood results.  With task management software, the nurses can input tasks (like 'please prescribe more fluids') that will automatically get delivered to the right clinician - and if they are busy with another patient, the task can be re-assigned to someone else.  That way the work is spread more evenly, the ward staff know that the job will be done, and one doctor won't be left with tasks stacking up that they are unable to get to for hours.  This technology could transform the way we work: a tool that facilitates the handover of all jobs at the touch of a button.  Sure, it's still important to discuss cases verbally, but the receiving doctor could actually listen rather than having to write everything down.  There are many other possibilities; a tool that automatically alerts clinicians to abnormal blood test results, tools that flag up a risk of sepsis, acute kidney injury or diarrhoeal illness, one that requests specialty referrals. The list goes on.  Last year there were two peer-reviewed evaluations of an electronic vital signs monitoring system. One found that the introduction of the monitoring system was associated with a reduction of over 700 deaths in one year at two NHS hospitals, while the other showed that the infection prevention tool was associated with a reduction in norovirus outbreaks by 90% across an NHS trust.  I suppose it is also important not to get too carried away. I've never used these systems so haven't been party to glitches or technical issues, although colleagues I spoke to mentioned difficulties with Wi-Fi blackspots and some patients not being on the system.  Let's be optimistic. These new monitoring techniques really do sound like it had the potential to improve care, efficiency and productivity'  However the state of technology in some hospitals is frankly embarrassing. In many cases it makes the work of frontline staff far harder than it needs to be.  For once, give us technologies that will transform the way we work. I really can't wait to try them.

That is despite many people in the age group having at least one chronic disease.  Participants were asked to rate how confident, cheerful, relaxed and useful they felt in their early 60s and then again aged 68 to 69.  The Medical Research Council survey has tracked the health and wellbeing of 1,700 people since their birth.  When the responses of those aged 60 to 64 were compared to their feelings towards the end of their seventh decade, the survey found there was an overall average improvement in all aspects of wellbeing.  This mirrors the results of previous studies which found that people in their 60s and 70s were more content than those in their 50s.  And a recent large survey of UK adults found those aged 65 to 79 to be the happiest age group.  Those aged 45 to 59 reported the lowest levels of life satisfaction.  Research shows the better you fit into the personality of your area, the happier you are.  Take the test to find the best place in Britain for you  Dr Mai Stafford, the programme leader at the MRC's unit for lifelong health and ageing at University College London, said it was not yet clear what was behind the rise in wellbeing during people's 60s.  "We found that one in five experienced a substantial increase in wellbeing in later life, although we also found a smaller group who experienced a substantial decline," she said.  "The benefit of using a cohort study like this is that we can look at how individuals change over time.  "We hope this will allow us to pinpoint which common experiences may be linked to an improvement in wellbeing in later life."  In their 60s and 70s, people are more likely to prioritise social relationships and look after their mental health, she explained.  "By that time you've worked out what makes you feel better and what doesn't."  Although people are living longer, poor health in old age is still a concern.  Most survey participants reported having at least one common chronic disease such as arthritis, diabetes or hypertension.	health

The work and pensions secretary said leaving would be a "stride into the light", enabling the UK to trade freely and control migration.  He accused In campaigners of belittling Britain's strength, as if the UK was "too inconsequential" to cope outside.  David Cameron has said an EU exit would cause uncertainty and economic pain.  Labour said the Conservatives were "split down the middle" over the issue while the opposition was "united" in its backing for continued EU membership.  A referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave will be held on 23 June.  Analysis: How will a divided government work during the campaign?  The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know  The prime minister has challenged Mr Duncan Smith and other Conservative cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU to spell out their alternative vision.  And Chancellor George Osborne has said so-called Brexit would cause a "profound economic shock" - an argument echoed by other G20 finance ministers on Saturday.  But Mr Duncan Smith dismissed these claims as scare stories, saying Britain was the "greatest country on earth", more than capable of prospering outside the EU, which he said was more of a "political project" than a "defined economic entity".  He told the Andrew Marr Show: "I am positive about leaving the EU because I believe rather than saying it is a leap in the dark, I think it is a stride into the light. It is about hope versus pessimism and people will vote for that."  Mr Duncan Smith said the UK had "faced bigger trials than this".  "It has stood alone in war but it has also defined trade around the world...Britain is a phenomenal country. It has stood alone and fought for freedom. It has been a global trader, it can again be a global trader.  "Why would we have such a low opinion of the British people that we going about talking about a leap in the dark and profound shocks?"  Asked whether he believed the PM's argument lacked patriotism, he replied: "It is not about personalities but the In Campaign's whole strategy has been about saying 'basically we are too small, too little, inconsequential, we can't do what we want. I don't know why anyone would want to run a country like this."  While the EU was an important trading partner, he said the level of two-way trade had been exaggerated. If the UK voted to leave the EU, he said, it would be able to negotiate a simpler trade-based relationship enabling it to have "access to the world and to the EU".  "We do a deal with the EU. That is a trade deal, it is about access to our markets and access to theirs. Part of our red lines would be about us being able to control our borders as we want…That deal is very doable."  The former Conservative leader also rejected suggestions that an Out vote could trigger the break up of the UK, saying the idea that it could provoke another independence referendum in Scotland was "absurd".  Mr Duncan Smith's intervention was welcomed by the Vote Leave campaign group, which tweeted: "All the government has is project fear - we will be explaining to people project hope, how Britain and EU will be better after we take control."  But pro-EU campaign group, Britain Stronger in Europe, said Mr Duncan Smith had failed to explain how the UK could retain access to the European single market while not upholding principles of freedom of movement.  And small business minister Anna Soubry, who is campaigning to stay in the EU, said leaving would be "chaotic" and stall a much-needed process of economic reform.  "If people vote to stay in, we will remain within a reformed EU with a wind of change I believe is blowing right across it," she told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.  "Colleagues from other countries are really talking about the need to advance the programme of deregulation, fewer directives, that we have led."  Labour's Angela Eagle accused eurosceptics of wanting to turn the clock back to the 1970s and focusing trade strategy on the rest of the Commonwealth.  "Their attention is elsewhere so we have to have to make the best of where we are," she told Marr.  "I believe that we should be confident about our values and we can project our values if we work through international organisations and the EU is one such organisation."  She claimed it "would be Labour votes" which keeps the UK in the EU and the party was "absolutely united in our determination that we get the right decision".	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35655035	Necklace aids child vaccination	Around 1.5 million children die around the world every year from diseases that could be prevented through vaccination. India has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the world at under 60% - well below the World Health Organization's 90% target.  But in rural Rajasthan, a simple necklace - which contains a child's vaccination records in a computer chip - is helping boost the numbers protected.  Khushi Baby - which means happy baby - is a plastic pendant on a black string. A computer chip embedded in the pendant stores vaccination data of the baby wearing it, along with the mother's health records.  By keeping the information on the child rather than on medical cards which can be lost or on paper logbooks that can become cumbersome and are almost impossible to search through, health workers can ensure babies get the right vaccinations at the right time.  The chip communicates with a smartphone or tablet, allowing health care workers in remote areas to access real-time data on the child's vaccination schedule.  When the health worker returns to the city, the data is uploaded to a central cloud allowing them to take the right supplies on their next field visits.  The Ministry of Health and other health officials can also access the data.  Eight-month-old Guddia Damur has had all the required immunisations for her age.  Guddia is a term of affection for newborns but with births rarely being registered in parts of India, it is a common name.  The sheer number of children called Guddia creates confusion under the paper-based system.  But thanks to Khushi Baby, Guddia's mother Babli says health workers are always able to access her data on the spot. The necklace also reminds Babli of when her next injections are due.  Local mothers were involved in the design of the necklace. It's similar to those worn by newborns in parts of India called a 'tabeez'.  Babli said: "Women make our babies wear the black thread around their neck, so that babies are protected from the evil eye."  For researchers, marrying tradition with technology converts a superstitious belief into better health behavior.  Mohammed Shahnawaz, one of the team behind Khushi Baby, said: "It has got a cultural significance here and people do wear such type of wearable in this part of India.  "This pendant is less than a dollar cost, it's rugged, waterproof and can be replicated into other form factors like bangles for mothers, like watches for elders."  Khushi Baby was originally designed by undergraduate students at Yale University in 2013. Since then the team has gone on to raise $350,000 in funding and has partnered with a local Indian NGO.  Around 1,500 babies are already in the system, and initial data is showing improved vaccination rates.  Once the mother's contact details are in the system, the family is automatically reminded - in their local dialect - why vaccinations are needed, and when to bring their children to the next vaccination camp.  Mothers say the necklace also acts as a visual reminder about their child's immunisation schedule.  "People are definitely coming more because of the pendant, before they didn't know when their baby's vaccinations were due," said Bhavna, a front line health worker.  It is hoped it will be possible to scale up the project to include 5,000 children by the end of the year.  And beyond that, they hope to one day integrate the system with the health care registry in India, connecting people in the most remote areas to a digital system.  For now, the "medical passport" is aiming to help children like Guddia and ensure they are protected from some of the most dangerous infectious diseases that could kill in the first few years of life.	health

But Roger Ordish said the warning would have applied to any presenter and was not based on a concern that young people would be harmed.  It follows the Dame Janet Smith review which found that the BBC missed chances to stop "monstrous" abuse by Savile.  The review identified 72 victims of Savile including eight rape victims.  In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Ordish - who produced Jim'll Fix It for its whole 19-year run - said he remembered telling staff Savile should not be left alone with youngsters.  But he said the advice was not based on a fear that "something awful" might happen but a rule that children should always be chaperoned.  He also said that Savile's presence could be "unnerving" and "frightening" for some young people.  In her review Dame Janet described Mr Ordish as honest and decent, saying she was satisfied he had not been aware of any criminal conduct by Savile.  Dame Janet said Savile - who died in 2011 aged 84 without ever facing prosecution - and broadcaster Stuart Hall were "serial sexual predators" and the BBC had missed five clear opportunities to stop their misconduct.  The report found Savile would commit sexual assaults "whenever the opportunity arose" and incidents took place "in virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked".  His usual tactic with young girls - and in some cases boys - was to groom them by inviting them to watch him perform on set and then make a sexual approach in his dressing room, the report said.  The review found that senior managers were not told of complaints about Savile because of an "atmosphere of fear" which still exists in the BBC.  The impartial investigation was set up by the BBC in 2012 to look at the corporation's culture and practices during the years it employed Savile - thought to be from 1964 to 2007. It found:	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35672158	George Osborne warns of further spending cuts in Budget	Chancellor George Osborne has warned he may have to make fresh cuts to public spending in next month's Budget.  Mr Osborne told the BBC global economic turmoil and slower growth meant "we may need to undertake further reductions".  He slowed the pace of cuts in the last spending review, but suggested savings could be announced in his 16 March Budget statement as figures showed the UK economy was smaller than expected.  Labour's John McDonnell said it was "a total humiliation" for Mr Osborne.  Speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg during a visit to China, Mr Osborne said he would rather look for extra cuts now than risk breaking his own manifesto commitment to achieve a surplus in the budget by the end of this Parliament, in 2020.  The chancellor did not completely rule out raising taxes in the event of a further slowdown in growth, but said now was not the time for "significant" tax hikes.  He would not spell out the details of any further cuts, but said the Conservatives would stick to their manifesto pledge to protect some government departments.  It is understood he would not look to increase the level of cuts dramatically but would initially seek to make further efficiencies in government departments.  Mr Osborne said he wanted to "root our country in the principle that we live within our means" and would address this in the Budget.  Explaining why he was planning to make further savings, the chancellor said the global economy had got "markedly worse", the UK's economy needed to be more productive, and information from the Office for National Statistics showed it was also smaller than expected.  He said: "Because of all of those things, we have to respond to those events.  "So that's what our plan is rooted in and it may require further reductions in spending.  "I'll address that in the Budget but people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure."  He went on to say the "whole purpose of our economic plan was to have a budget surplus".  The chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda.  Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere.  He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity.  That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere.  Decisions about the level of potential future cuts will only be made once he receives the official assessments from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he added.  The extra cuts would be likely to be made towards the end of the Parliament, before 2020.  In his November statement, Mr Osborne watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments.  He was able to do this due to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that by 2020 Mr Osborne would be thinking about potentially being prime minister and leading the Conservatives into the next general election.  Mr Osborne believed having a surplus would show voters the Conservatives had "fixed the economy", he added.  Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the British people would end up paying for Mr Osborne's own failures.  He accused the chancellor of having "sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months - that his recovery is built on sand".  "Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world," he said.  "If the bankers' chancellor had been doing his job properly he would be collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers.  "Instead he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures."	politics

Their studies on survivors in Liberia showed large numbers had developed weakness, memory loss and depressive symptoms in the six months after being discharged from an Ebola unit.  Other patients were "actively suicidal" or still having hallucinations.  More than 17,000 people in West Africa have survived Ebola infection.  The evidence, being presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of Neurology, is an early glimpse at a much wider study of long-term health problems after Ebola.  The initial analysis, on 82 survivors, showed most had had severe neurological problems at the height of the infection, including meningitis, hallucinations or falling into a coma.  Six months later, new long-term problems had developed.  About two-thirds had body weakness, while regular headaches, depressive symptoms and memory loss were found in half of patients.  Two of the patients had been actively suicidal at the time of the assessment.  Dr Lauren Bowen, from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, told the BBC: "It was pretty striking, this is a young population of patients, and we wouldn't expect to have seen these sorts of problems.  "When people had memory loss, it tended to affect their daily living, with some feeling they couldn't return to school or normal jobs, some had terrible sleeping problems.  "Ebola hasn't gone away for these people."  Infection with Ebola ravages the body. Some of the symptoms could improve with time as the body heals, others may be down to social trauma as many survivors are ostracised from their families and communities.  But other symptoms, including eye problems, indicate damage to the brain, which may not heal.  Meanwhile, data presented earlier, at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, raised concerns about sexual transmission of the virus in survivors.  It indicated 38% of men had tested positive for Ebola in their semen on at least one occasion in the year after recovering.  And in the most extreme case, Ebola had been detected 18 months later.  Yet most survivors reported being sexually active, with only four in every 100 using a condom.	health

The prime minister said his mother would advise the Labour leader to "put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem".  He was hitting back at a jibe from a Labour MP about his mother.  The Labour leader took a few moments to respond as Tory MPs barracked him, before offering some "motherly advice" about standing up for a free NHS.  "My late mother would have said, 'stand up for the principle of a health service free at the point of use for everybody', because that's what she dedicated her life to, as did many of her generation," he said.  A tweet then went out from Mr Corbyn's official account that quoted Albert Einstein.  "'If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes & shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas & shoddy philosophies' Einstein #pmqs," the message said.  The PM later appeared at a Conservative EU rally without a tie or jacket, joking that he had "ignored my mother's own advice".  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan defended his decision to criticise Mr Corbyn's dress sense, which followed a heckle from a Labour MP.  "What was really noticeable on Monday during the EU statement was that Jeremy Corbyn's top button was not done up, his tie wasn't straight," she told BBC Radio 4's World At One.  "Actually I think there are standards in Parliament. If you bring families or mothers into it you can expect to have a pretty firm bite-back from any politician."  A senior Labour source said: "I think when you are losing an argument, you resort to personal insult. When you are not able to answer questions on the NHS, you resort to silly insults. It's got no place in politics."  The source said Mr Corbyn had "several suits", adding: "I don't think he will be taking sartorial advice from David Cameron or his mother."  Mr Cameron's mother Mary hit the headlines earlier this month after signing a petition against cuts to children's centres in his constituency.  The two leaders were arguing about the junior doctors dispute when they began trading jibes about what their mothers would say.  Mr Corbyn asked if the PM would be "writing another letter to himself, asking on behalf of his constituents asking for the health secretary to intervene and support his local NHS?"  The prime minister was heckled by Labour MPs as he made his reply, with one shouting "ask your mother".  "Ask my mother?" said the prime minister.  "I think I know what my mother would say. I think she would look across the despatch box and she would say 'Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem'."  Mr Cameron's attack delighted Tory backbenchers who cheered uproariously for more than 30 seconds.  But Labour MPs on twitter accused him of making a personal attack and of bringing Prime Minister's Questions to a "new low".  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron tweeted: "When #PMQs descends into a series of 'Your mum' comments it shows all politicians up. It's school-ground antics that demeans."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35650171	Major insight into killer pancreatic cancer	Pancreatic cancer is at least four separate diseases each with a different cause and needing a different treatment, scientists have discovered.  The researchers say the knowledge will lead to new drugs targeting the Achilles' heel of each patients' cancer and that they have already seen some "exceptional" results.  Cancer charities said the findings were "incredibly exciting".  The analysis, published in the journal Nature, looked at 456 patients' cancer.  Tumours are caused by mutations in DNA that make healthy tissue turn cancerous - but there is more than one way to make a cancer.  While all the pancreatic cancers looked similar, there were four classes of genetic error that led to tumour formation.  And these four cancers have been labelled:  One example of how different the cancers are is the average survival time from diagnosis with squamous-type cancers was just four months - roughly half that of the other types.  But crucially, the knowledge could lead to new treatments.  Dr Andrew Biankin, one of the researchers at the University of Glasgow, told the BBC News website: "This is the most comprehensive analysis of the blueprint of pancreatic cancer.  "So this knowledge reveals what makes these cancers tick and which ones may be vulnerable to particular treatments by defining the Achilles' heel of every cancer."  It would be a much needed breakthrough for a type of cancer stubbornly difficult to treat.  Most people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are told they have less than a year to live.  And just 1% of them are alive 10 years after being diagnosed - a survival rate unchanged for four decades.  Meanwhile, dramatic improvements in breast, prostate and colon cancer care mean pancreatic tumours are predicted to kill more people than any other cancer, apart from lung, in some countries.  "It's just a really tough cancer," Dr Biankin said.  But he hopes matching drugs to specific errors in tumours will help patients.  He said: "The fact that we see, through chance, that some patients respond exceptionally to a particular therapy allows us to expand these insights so we can treat more patients with similar cancers at a genetic level."  It is thought the "immunogenic" pancreatic cancers may be vulnerable to a new wave of immunotherapies already transforming cancer, and clinical trials are already under way.  Leanne Reynolds, the head of research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: "The findings of this research are incredibly exciting for anyone affected by pancreatic cancer, as they should mean that in the future the right patients can be given the right treatment at the right time.  "If we can predict more accurately which treatment would be most effective for each patient, we can ensure patients have the best chance of living for as long as possible, as well as possible."  Dr Emma Smith, from Cancer Research UK, said: "Identifying different types of pancreatic cancer and revealing the disease's complexity is an important step towards finding more effective treatments.  "This will help to ensure patients are given the therapies that are most likely to help."	health

At least 770,000 names have been removed from the electoral register, the Electoral Commission says.  The watchdog said young people had been hit the hardest.  The government says the new system will cut down on electoral fraud and "ghost" entries on the register.  Voters now have to register as individuals rather than by household.  Millions of people were transferred automatically on to the new register after having their identity confirmed by checking social security and council tax records.  Names that could not be verified in this way were kept on the register until 1 December but have now been removed.  People in England, Scotland and Wales can register to vote online - if they live in Northern Ireland they can print out a form and send it to their local registration office.  Since December, 1.3 million people have signed up to vote individually, following an advertising campaign encouraging people to get on the electoral roll in time for May's elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and council ballots across England.  But the Electoral Commission and the Labour Party said the transition had been rushed and people in short-term rental agreements, often in urban areas, and those moving on a regular basis, such as students, had been disproportionately affected.  Under the old system, universities registered students en masse.  The Electoral Commission said last June that 1.9 million names had disappeared from the register across England, Scotland and Wales as a result of the changes - although it was not clear how many of these were actually entitled to vote.  The government ignored the watchdog's advice to keep names on the register for longer to allow councils more time to check them.  In its latest assessment, the commission has "significantly" reduced its estimate of the missing names to 770,000 - although the figure is still equivalent to 1.7% of the total 43.4 million electorate.  But it also pointed out the figure was not comprehensive as the London borough of Hackney could not provide accurate information.  "It is not possible to estimate the number of eligible electors who were removed from the registers," it said in a statement.  "However, the commission reports that it is likely that some of the removed entries related to electors that were eligible to remain registered to vote."  It said the number of under-18s - so-called "attainers", qualifying to vote during the registration period - had fallen by 40% since March 2014.  In its report, the watchdog has made a number of recommendations to government to try to halt the decline in registration.  Labour said the decline in the number of young people registering to vote was "shocking", adding: "What's worse is that the government are shamelessly taking this as an opportunity to redraw constituency boundaries based on an electorate that is far lower than it should be."  The independent Boundary Commission for England said on Wednesday it had begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England.  The move follows a decision by Parliament to reduce the number of constituencies in the UK from 650 to 600, and to ensure that there are roughly the same number of electors in each constituency.  Sam Hartley, secretary to the Boundary Commission for England, said: "Once we publish our initial proposals in the autumn, we will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground. Everyone's views will help us recommend a well-considered and practical set of constituency boundaries in England."  John Penrose, Minister for Constitutional Reform, said: "Councils have only removed 'ghost' electors - people who have moved, died or never existed in the first place - so keeping them on the register when we know they shouldn't be there, and then sending them all poll cards on election day, would be wrong, expensive and increase the risk of fraud.  "Equalising the size of constituencies in the Boundary Review means everyone's vote will carry equal weight.  "If we let some constituencies stay smaller than others, voters will have more power in them than people in bigger ones. And the boundaries would be based on data that's 20 years out of date. That can't be fair or right."  Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest 600,000 people have fallen off the register in the past year.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35597243	Hunt 'misrepresented' data on 7-day NHS	The health secretary "misrepresented" data to put his case for a seven-day NHS in England, says Jeremy Corbyn.  The Labour leader attacked Jeremy Hunt after the BBC revealed the health secretary used academically unverified and unpublished data to back his plans.  Last July, in the pay row with junior doctors, Mr Hunt said there were about 6,000 deaths a year because of the lack of "a proper seven-day service".  Emails show one of the paper's authors was unhappy with the figure being used.  But the Department of Health said later analysis estimated about 11,000 excess deaths due to the "weekend effect".  A spokesman said the information had been shared with the department by the NHS's medical director for England, Sir Bruce Keogh.  Labour is calling for an investigation into whether Mr Hunt leaned on his department in order to cover up his advance sight of the study.  Last July, Mr Hunt said: "Around 6,000 people lose their lives every year because we do not have a proper seven-day service in hospitals."  This figure was then used regularly by the government in its argument for changes to doctors' contracts.  The news prompted a heated clash in Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister and health secretary owed the profession an apology.  "This dispute with junior doctors has been on the basis of misrepresented research."  But David Cameron defended Mr Hunt, saying the contract was needed to introduce more seven-day services.  "I have to say - I think if Nye Bevan was here today, he'd want a seven-day NHS because he knew the NHS was for patients up and down our country," he added.  But Mr Corbyn hit back: "Nye Bevan would be turning in his grave if he could hear your attitude towards the NHS."  The BBC story revealed emails from NHS England showed Mr Hunt knew details of the sensitive study into weekend deaths at least two months before it was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), and based the 6,000 figure on his understanding of the data.  When the BBC asked NHS England and the Department of Health for the source of the 6,000 figure, neither was able to answer.  The UK Statistics Authority then wrote to NHS England, reminding the department that "data mentioned publicly by ministers should be available equally to all users".  An email released under the Freedom of Information Act, written by NHS England's Seven Day Services Forum project manager Deborah Williams to one of the BMJ study authors, said: "We were challenged to cite the source of the 6,000 figure and attempted to offer up the most bland statement possible, that would neither confirm not contradict [Mr Hunt's] statement."  The study author, Domenico Pagano, refused to corroborate Mr Hunt's use of the figures, saying: "It will be inaccurate and counterproductive to quote that our analysis is due to be published in the BMJ shortly, as this is not the case and may seem to interfere with the peer review process."  When finally published in September 2015, the research actually suggested there were 11,000 excess deaths per year as a result of the "weekend effect" - although the authors pointed out this could not be proven to be linked to staffing levels.  A separate string of emails seen by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act shows officials at Whitehall and NHS England then backtracked, using a combination of figures already in the public domain from 2009 and 2012 to attempt to provide an explanation for the 6,000 excess deaths claim. NHS England then published this in a "low-key fashion" on their website on 6 August.  One official at the Department of Health wrote to another at NHS England explaining the fudge, saying: "I am keen to avoid undue criticism of either [the Department of Health] or NHS England'.  NHS England has now admitted Mr Hunt had had advance sight of "headline figures" of the BMJ study prior to it being accepted for publication.  A spokesman said NHS medical director for England Sir Bruce Keogh and one of the study's authors alongside Dr Pagano, had shared some findings with "interested parties" including the Department of Health and the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB).  This is despite NHS England's Freedom of Information Officer saying in October last year: "Sir Bruce Keogh did not discuss the study's findings with anyone at the Department of Health at any point before or after the publication of this article."  NHS England now says this October statement is "clearly a mistake, and absurd" and Sir Bruce is "devastated" the focus has now shifted from "the issues of patient safety".  NHS England said: "The data on this topic has been consistent and it cannot be dismissed or ignored.  "We make no apology for using data and analysis to inform NHS and government policy in the best interests of patients."  A Department of Health spokesman said: "This 6,000 figure was NHS England's analysis. Subsequent independent clinical studies have shown further variation in the quality of care across the week, and more recent analysis makes clear there could actually be as many as 11,000 excess deaths owing to the 'weekend effect'."  Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said: "This is an extremely serious state of affairs given the weight attached to these figures by the health secretary in justifying changes to junior doctors' contracts.  "Rather than admitting the source of the figures, it seems that civil servants had to cobble together a post-hoc rationalisation for Jeremy Hunt's sound bites.  "There now needs to be a full investigation about whether pressure was put upon officials and whether the health secretary was involved."	health

The Health and Social Care Information Centre data showed the proportion of women aged 50-70 screened fell to 63.3% in 2014-15, from 70.1% in 2004-05.  Breast screening coverage - the overall number checked - has also fallen for the fourth year in a row.  Experts said the reasons for the falls needed to be urgently investigated.  Under the NHS Breast Screening Programme, women are usually invited for their first routine check between the ages of 50 and 53, then normally invited back every three years until the age of 70.  There are also pilots at most of England's screening centres, where the age range invited for screening is being extended to those aged 47-49 and 71-73.  Overall, 2.11 million women were screened in 2014-15, from a total of 2.8 million who were invited.  Coverage of women aged 53 to 70 was 75.4% at 31 March 2015, down from a peak of 77.2% in 2011.  Cancer was more likely to be found among the older women screened.  Pritpal Rayat of HSCIC said: "These statistics show the falling proportion of women at the younger end of the programme's target group who are being screened after they get their first invitation."  Dr Anne Mackie, Public Health England's director of screening, said: "It is encouraging that more than 75% of women are having regular breast screening. However, there has been a downward trend over the last four years.  "The fall in attendance is most notable in women receiving their first invitation and we are working hard with our NHS and community colleagues to understand why this might be and make the programme accessible to all women who wish to be screened."  Eluned Hughes, head of public health and information at Breast Cancer Now, said: "The continued decline in the number of women taking up their first screening invitation is of real concern.  "There will be a complexity of reasons behind this trend and further investigation into these causes is now urgently required at a local level.  "Comprehensive evidence has shown that screening prevents deaths from breast cancer, but there are some small risks as well as benefits.  "Ultimately, the earlier breast cancer is picked up, the more likely treatment is to be successful. Whether they choose to attend screening or not, we'd encourage all women to check themselves regularly, to get to know how their breasts normally look and feel, and to report any unusual changes to their GP."	health

The cases include several involving pregnant women, the CDC said.  The public health body made the revelation as it published new guidance on sexual transmission of the virus.  The guidance has been issued in response to confirmation of the first case of Zika in a non-traveller in the continental United States.  That case was linked to sexual contact with an infected partner.  The CDC is advising all men who have travelled to an area active with the Zika virus to use condoms or abstain from sex for the length of the pregnancy.  There is no evidence yet that women can transmit Zika virus to their sex partners, but more research is needed to understand this issue, the health body said.  Scientists last week said a study involving pregnant women in Brazil "strengthened" the theory that Zika is linked to the microcephaly birth defects in babies.  The defect can cause babies to be born with abnormally small heads and affect their cognitive development.  The research confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of two women who had had Zika-like symptoms during their pregnancies.  Brazilian experts say this suggests the virus can infect the foetus.  The primary method of infection of the virus remains mosquito bites. Experts say women who are pregnant should try to avoid the insects.  On Tuesday, Margaret Chan, the head of the World Health Organization, said the world faced "a long journey" to defeat Zika.  Speaking in Brazil, where most cases have been recorded, she said it was a "very tricky, very tenacious, very difficult" virus.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35644659	Junior doctors set to hold more strikes	Junior doctors are to take part in three more strikes and launch a judicial review as part of their fight against the government's decision to impose a new contract in England.  The government condemned the announcement by the British Medical Association, which comes two weeks after ministers said they would force the changes on doctors from the summer.  Ministers say the contact will improve services, and strikes are unnecessary.  The BMA says the contract is unfair.  The latest move marks a further escalation in the long-running dispute, which is fast becoming the most bitter breakdown in relations between the government and medical profession since the NHS was created.  The three strikes in March and April will each last 48 hours, although emergency cover will be provided.  The stoppages will be held on:  Two strikes have already been held this year - one in January and one in February. Both lasted just 24 hours.  BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said he had spent the last two weeks consulting with members and they had given a "resounding message" that they "cannot and will not accept" the imposition, which includes paying doctors less to work Saturdays.  "The government must put patients before politics, get back around the table and find a negotiated solution to this dispute," he added.  The BMA also believes it has found legal grounds for a challenge.  Under the Equality Act 2010, there is an onus to show "due regard" to equalities issues, typically through carrying out an equality impact assessment.  This would look at issues such as whether access to services could be compromised by a change in policy.  The BMA said the government has failed to provide evidence such an assessment has been done and so will challenge the government in the courts over it.  A Department of Health spokesman said: "Further strike action is completely unnecessary and will mean tens of thousands more patients face cancelled operations - over a contract that was 90% agreed with the BMA.  "We urge junior doctors to look at the detail of the contract and the clear benefits it brings.  The news comes hours after the government's former patient safety adviser said ministers were wrong to impose the contract.  Prof Don Berwick, who led a review for government on safety three years ago, said there should be a three-year moratorium on the imposition of the new contract and called on the government to "apologise".  He said the NHS had a "demoralised" workforce and needed to find another way out of the "mess", the Health Service Journal reported.  Speaking at an event in London at the King's Fund think-tank, Prof Berwick, who has also acted as a health adviser to US President Barack Obama, said: "You cannot achieve excellence in combat with your future workforce, it makes no sense at all."  The Prime Minister's spokeswoman said the freshly announced strikes were "regrettable", but she was sure discussions would continue.  And Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which has been negotiating with doctors on behalf of the government, added the move was "disappointing" as the majority of the BMA's concerns had been addressed in the final contract offer.  "This disruption to patient care is unnecessary. I strongly believe that the final contract is safe, fair and reasonable. For the sake of the NHS, and patients I urge all junior doctors to take a look at the contract in detail before taking part in any future action."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35629034	UK air pollution 'linked to 40,000 early deaths a year'	Outdoor air pollution is contributing to about 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK, say the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health.  They say diesel emissions have been poorly controlled.  And indoor air pollution has been overlooked.  Tobacco still poses the biggest indoor threat, but wood-burning stoves, cleaning products and air fresheners can contribute.  Mould and mildew in poorly ventilated rooms can also cause illness.  "Being indoors can offer some protection against outdoor air pollution, but it can also expose us to other air pollution sources," the report says.  "There is now good awareness of the risks from badly maintained gas appliances, radioactive radon gas and second-hand tobacco smoke, but indoors we can also be exposed to NO2 [nitrogen dioxide] from gas cooking and solvents that slowly seep from plastics, paints and furnishings.  "The lemon-and-pine scents that we use to make our homes smell fresh can react chemically to generate air pollutants, and ozone-based air fresheners can also cause indoor air pollution."  Co-author Prof Jonathan Grigg said there was now clear evidence that air pollution - largely from factories and traffic - was linked to heart disease and lung problems, including asthma.  "As NHS costs continue to escalate due to poor public health - asthma alone costs the NHS an estimated £1bn a year - it is essential that policy makers consider the effects of long-term exposure on our children and the public purse," he said.  Prof Grigg said the public could also help by:  Prof Stephen Holgate, asthma expert at Southampton University and chairman of the reporting group, warned against complacency.  "We all have a part to play to cut environmental pollution. We can't see it, smell it or taste it, which is why people do not necessarily think we have a problem," he said.  Is there a danger from scented products?  "When you see cars piling up on the way to school taking their children, the fumes directly from the vehicle in front are being vented straight into the car behind, and exposing their child - and yet we are ignoring this," he added.  Prof Holgate called for authorities to monitor pollution levels more closely, build new homes away from busy roads and consider closing particularly polluted roads at certain times.  He also advised people to open and close windows in the home several times a day.  "It's amazing that we are now living in these tight, sealed homes that we are frightened of opening the window and letting a bit of fresh air in," he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.  A spokesman from the Chemical Industries Association said: "This report should be seen as a significant contribution to an important debate. Chemical and pharmaceutical businesses take their responsibilities extremely seriously in both the production and use of their products, with due regard to the health of their employees and the public at large.  "Improving air quality is central to that responsibility and we will continue to be proactive in meeting our regulatory requirements and delivering innovative solutions that seek to minimise the risks of exposure."	health

Two mothers share their different views with BBC News.  With my first child, I opted for the more natural environment of a birthing centre, on the advice of the midwives, who said I was an ideal, healthy candidate.  But I ended up being transferred in a very rushed and undignified way to a hospital 10 miles away, where I had to have an emergency [Caesarean] section.  I certainly did not feel in control of my body, but there was comfort in knowing the people around me knew what they were doing and I was in good hands.  The amount of aftercare, both physical and mental, I needed was more than I ever expected.  If I had a till register pinging away at the back of my mind, this would have only added to my anxiety.  I agree that a certain amount of control and choice should be given to mothers. However, this is a step too far.  I personally took comfort in the advice I received from all the professionals I encountered during my pregnancies, even if my first didn't go to plan.  Pregnancy, especially your first, can be a very vulnerable time.  The pressure of having to decide how best to spend a care budget should be left to the professionals.  More money should be poured into educating mothers.  Who would monitor the poor decision-making of some mothers clearly allocating their budgets in ill-effective ways?  You are effectively entrusting medical issues and all power into mothers' hands, and some younger mums might not be best placed to make those decisions.  I also think there may be other hidden agendas here, perhaps encouraging some women to give birth elsewhere puts less pressure on the NHS.  I can't help but think this is one step closer to privatisation.  Maybe more information needs to be released regarding the management of the scheme.  This is going to make a massive difference to so many women across the country.  To be able to make the choice of how to be cared for, without the financial worry of how to fund private services, is amazing.  I had a poor first experience in hospital. I felt as though I didn't have a say in anything.  I had requested gas and air, but that all went out of the window when the moment arrived to give birth. I did not have any control.  I was kept in hospital longer than I expected, and I felt like I was a burden. I remember saying at the time that I would never give birth in hospital again.  I didn't realise at the time how much of a traumatic experience it had been for me, until I got pregnant again.  By then I knew my own body, and I knew what I wanted and what was right for me.  During my second and third pregnancies, I wanted to hire an independent midwife but simply could not afford it.  I did have home births though, and it was a much more relaxed affair.  I'm currently 31 weeks pregnant and weighing up my options.  I've hired a doula to support me but feel other services would be too costly or simply not available in my area.  If I had a £3,000 budget, it would go some way in getting the help I want and need.  I have developed gestational diabetes during this pregnancy, and although I want to give birth at home again, I may not be able to.  I do believe it is very important to have the back-up of maternity services at the hospital just in case something goes wrong.  I'd like to see whether that would be affected by this change.	health

Prof Don Berwick, who led a review for government on safety three years ago, said there should be a three-year moratorium on the new contract.  He said the NHS had a "demoralised" workforce and needed to find another way out of the "mess".  Ministers have said the new contract is needed to improve safety at weekends.  But Prof Berwick cast doubt on that by saying it may be "impossible" for the NHS to tackle the issue given the current level of funding, the HSJ reports.  Speaking at an event in London at the King's Fund think-tank, Prof Berwick said: "You cannot achieve excellence in combat with your future workforce, it makes no sense at all.  "So you need to find a way to de-escalate... I think the government should apologise."  But Prof Berwick, who has also acted as a health adviser to US President Barack Obama, said there did not need to be resignations but urged ministers to acknowledge their "mistake".  He also urged junior doctors to have "some courage and generosity" and embrace some of the changes being made.  Was a contract deal ever possible?  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  Prof Berwick is the most high profile figure yet to speak out against the decision to impose the new contract.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made the announcement earlier this month after talks with the British Medical Association broke down.  The BMA has argued the deal is "flawed" and say they have put forward a "fair and affordable" alternative.  The new contract, which reduces payments for weekend working, will start being rolled out in the summer.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35634524	Women to be offered their own £3,000 'birth budgets'	The NHS in England is to offer pregnant women their own "personal budgets", worth at least £3,000, so they can pick and choose the care they receive.  Women will be able to use it to pay for anything from one-to-one midwifery care to home births in pilots due to start later this year.  The move is part of a shake-up in maternity care unveiled by NHS England to increase the choices women have.  The overhaul is also aimed at improving safety in maternity services.  It has been agreed to on the basis of recommendations from an independent review of services.  This was set up by NHS England in the aftermath of the inquiry published last year into the failures that led to the deaths of babies at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust.  The review - chaired by Conservative peer Baroness Julia Cumberlege - said it had never been safer to give birth in England, but improvements still needed to be made to ensure care was "world class".  It also highlighted the £560m spent each year by the NHS on clinical negligence cases relating to maternity care.  The review took evidence from thousands of families about their experience of maternity care and found they "did not always have confidence" that complications would be picked up or problems investigated properly.  To improve care, the review has called for:  Women also complained about the lack of choice they were given, despite existing policy stating they should be able to choose where they give birth.  Nearly nine in 10 women give birth in hospital, but just one in four says this is where she would want to have a baby.  The review concluded there should no longer be an automatic assumption that a woman would give birth in hospital.  Baroness Cumberledge told the BBC personal budgets would give women "more clout and more opportunity to exercise the choices that they want".  "Women are telling us that one of the things they really want is continuity of the person looking after them... who looks after them through the pregnancy, through the birth and through the aftercare, and we know that's going to make a huge different to safety," she said.  Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said she was "delighted" with the plans, but warned more midwives would be needed to make these ambitions become reality.  There are currently 21,500 working in the NHS, but the college believes another 2,600 are needed.  Personal budgets are already used by the elderly, disabled and those with long-term conditions such as heart disease.  The system for maternity care, to be piloted later this year before a national rollout in 2017, would give women a notional budget they could then use on whichever NHS-accredited services they liked.  The details have yet to be fully ironed out. But the review authors said low-risk, standard births cost the NHS about £3,000, so women could expect that sum at the very least although more may be given if circumstances demand it and anyone needing urgent care because of complications would get it regardless of whether their personal budget had been spent.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said the review had set out a five-year strategy which the health service could now work towards, while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was a "significant moment" and would give women more choice and make services safer.  But James Titcombe, who became an NHS safety adviser following the death of his son Joshua at Morecambe Bay Hospital in 2008, urged caution.  "Community births and home births are cheaper and my concern is that a push to expand that needs to be done very, very carefully because the evidence about safety is questionable," he told the BBC.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35640299	Whatever happened to the obesity strategy?	The Prime Minister's battle against Brexit and the launch of the childhood obesity strategy would not at first glance appear to have much in common. But the former, in the shape of the dramatic events which have played out since last week, is highly relevant to the progress of the latter. The key thing to remember is that David Cameron is involved in both.  The Government strategy on childhood obesity in England has been much talked about since last summer. There was talk of a launch before Christmas, then early in the New Year, then in February. But still it has not appeared. There is speculation now that it may not be published before Easter. The simple reason is the Prime Minister's overcrowded diary and his current preoccupation with Europe.  David Cameron knows the clock is ticking down to the end of his premiership before the next election. He wants to make his mark on domestic policy and he has identified tackling obesity as an important potential part of his legacy. It is seen at Number Ten as a priority second term issue, to rank with the dementia initiative in his first term of office. Much of the groundwork has already been done by the Department of Health and Public Health England.  The trouble is Mr Cameron just does not seem to have time to think about the obesity question, let alone put the finishing touches to a strategy which is seen in Whitehall as potentially the most ambitious of its kind in the world. Europe and the drive to win a referendum dominate the Prime Minister's every waking hour. He told the House of Commons he would be making the case for staying in the EU "every day for the next four months". The question now is when he can find a slot in his diary to unveil a policy which has been long awaited by the NHS and the food and drink industry.  The first question to address is whether a sugar tax should form part of the childhood obesity strategy. A sugar tax is on the table having, last autumn, been left firmly on the shelf. Mr Cameron has come round to the idea that such a move might be electorally popular, not least with Jamie Oliver and those of like mind. Reports that a sugar tax will feature in the strategy have not been denied, though its likely to be there in the form of a threat to the food and drink industry if other measures do not work.  The Prime Minister will also have to decide whether regulation is required for reducing sugar content of food and drink and restricting product promotions in supermarkets. Public Health England's document on sugar reduction, published in October 2015, described how food price promotions are more widespread in the UK than anywhere else in Europe and how high sugar products are promoted more than others.  The strategy seems likely to contain measures to limit sales of confectionery at checkouts and in prominent positions in supermarket aisles. Restricting "buy one, get one free" offers for high sugar or high calorie food and drink products is another probable avenue. Mr Cameron's anti-red tape and pro-business leanings might steer him away from such an approach and towards a voluntary deal agreed with the supermarkets. But officials and experts will make the case for Government intervention.  You might imagine that leading retailers would throw their hands up in horror at the prospect of the Government limiting their freedom to promote products as they see fit. But perhaps surprisingly the British Retail Consortium, which represents big names on the High Street, has supported the idea of regulation. The BRC argues that a voluntary deal wont work as some shops will fail to go along with it. Better, the organisation argues, for everyone to be obliged to fall into line with new regulations.  Decisions are still needed from the Prime Minister. Much of the strategy is written. Health officials are anxious to get it launched with measures put in place to start tackling the obesity threat to the nation's health. But it remains off the menu in Downing Street, at least until Mr Cameron tires of his European diet.	health

Investigators found 2.75m more Google searches than expected, based on previous trends, shortly after Sheen had appeared on US TV in November.  Web searches for condoms, HIV symptoms and HIV testing also rocketed.  The researchers say the 'Sheen effect' should be capitalised on, to further raise HIV awareness.  In relative terms, all HIV searches were 417 percent higher than expected on the day of Sheen's disclosure.  Condom searches, such as "buy condoms", increased 75%. HIV symptoms, such as "signs of HIV", and HIV testing, such as "find HIV testing" searches increased 540% and 214%, respectively, the day of Sheen's disclosure, and remained higher for three days.  Speaking in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researcher Professor John Ayers, from San Diego State University, said: "While no one should be forced to reveal their HIV status and all diagnoses are tragic, Sheen's disclosure may benefit public health by potentially helping many learn more about HIV and HIV prevention.  "More must be done to make this benefit larger and lasting."  Back in November, Sheen, former start of sitcom Two And A Half Men, said he had gone to great lengths to keep his HIV status private.  He revealed to NBC presenter Matt Lauer that he had paid "enough to take it into the millions" to keep people from going public about his illness.  "I have to put a stop to this onslaught, this barrage of attacks and of sub-truths," he said, adding he was diagnosed four years ago.  During that interview he said: "If there was one guy on this planet to contract this that's going to deliver a cure, it's me. It's me. Seriously.  "I'm not going to be the poster man for this, but I will not shun away from responsibilities and opportunities that drive me to helping others."  He's not the first celebrity with health issues to cause a ripple effect in public behaviour.  Awareness of breast removal and reconstruction ops increased massively after Angelina Jolie's experiences were reported in the media.  Likewise, cervical cancer screening uptake went up after reality TV star Jade Goody died from the disease.  Alex Sparrowhawk, Membership Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust said there was no question that Charlie Sheen's forced disclosure had a huge impact, not only in the US but worldwide.  "As the UK's leading HIV and sexual health charity, Terrence Higgins Trust website had its busiest day ever on 17 November, with almost 20,000 page views. The most popular covered 'Stages of HIV infection', 'Getting Help Now' and 'What are HIV and AIDS'?  He said the "media circus" surrounding the Sheen story and the public reaction showed some attitudes were ignorant and outdated.  "There is definitely more work to be done in educating the public on HIV, but also in how the media report on HIV. It must be more widely understood as the long-term manageable health condition that it now is."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35625669	Profile: Boris Johnson	Boris Johnson's decision to campaign for Britain to leave the EU is being regarded as a huge boost for the Out campaign.  The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.  Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: "I want my star players on the pitch."  But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.  The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.  He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.  When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.  The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.  He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.  Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.  But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.  Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.  In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.  The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.  He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to "get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like".  Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as "too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs" and associating Papua New Guinea "with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing".  The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.  Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a "one-man melting pot". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.  The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.  At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.  In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.  His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.  Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as "Boris bikes", and ditched the "bendy bus" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.  Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.  He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.  Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.  In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do "another big job in politics" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.  Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.  His latest decision means that speculation is likely to continue.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35625037	'Conflicted' Boris Johnson expected to back EU exit	Senior Conservative MP and London mayor Boris Johnson will announce he is to campaign for Britain to leave the EU, the BBC understands.  His decision comes as ministers began campaigning over the UK's EU membership, after PM David Cameron called a referendum for 23 June.  The BBC's Norman Smith said Mr Johnson, previously thought to have been "conflicted", had now made up his mind.  The MP is expected to reveal his decision later on Sunday.  He will give the reasons for his decision in his column for the Telegraph newspaper, which is expected to be published at 22:00 GMT, according to a count-down on the paper's website.  The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said it would be a "big blow" to Number 10.  The Conservative candidate to be the next mayor of London, Zac Goldsmith, will also vote to leave the EU, his team has confirmed.  Mr Cameron has said he will campaign to remain in a "reformed" EU, but six ministers who attend cabinet have joined the leave campaign.  Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if he wished to send a message to Mr Johnson, the prime minister said he would "say to Boris what I say to everybody else".  "We will be safer, we'll be stronger, we'll be better off inside the EU.  "If Boris and if others really care about being able to get things done in our world, then the EU is one of the ways in which we get them done."  Referring to two other prominent supporters of the leave campaign, Mr Cameron also warned against "linking arms with Nigel Farage and George Galloway".  Earlier on the Marr Show, UKIP leader Mr Farage said he would "absolutely" like to see Mr Johnson come out in favour of leaving the EU.  "He's one of those half a dozen people that reaches out to a large number of voters. We'd love to see 'Bo Go' as the headline tomorrow."  Mr Johnson's sister, the writer Rachel Johnson, told Sky News's Murnaghan programme that her brother was not "milking his decision for maximum publicity".  She said: "It's a very, very hard choice that he has to make. It's a hard choice for everybody to make, because there are good and bad arguments on both sides."  Asked if he was "on the horns of a dilemma", she agreed, saying it was "agonising" for him.  Ms Johnson's refusal to give away what her brother might have decided led the Sun's Westminster correspondent, Harry Cole, to tweet about her "poker face".  House of Commons leader Chris Grayling told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme that he hoped Mr Johnson would join the campaign to leave the EU, adding: "I know no more about his intentions than anyone else."  Downing Street has been resigned to Mr Johnson campaigning to leave following a meeting this week which left him disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans on the EU, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.  Mr Johnson has also discussed the referendum with Justice Secretary Michael Gove, one of those to declare support for the leave campaign.  The Sunday Times reported that Mr Johnson, thought to have been undecided earlier, had told a Westminster colleague: "I'm veering all over the place like a shopping trolley."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35621079	EU referendum: Cameron sets June date for UK vote	The UK will vote on whether to remain in the EU on Thursday 23 June, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.  The prime minister made his historic announcement in Downing Street after briefing the cabinet.  He said he would be campaigning to remain in a reformed EU - and described the vote as one of the biggest decisions "in our lifetimes".  Ministers immediately divided up into the leave and remain camps as the campaigns got under way in earnest.  The referendum date announcement comes after renegotiations on the UK's relationship with Europe were finalised on Friday night after intense wrangling at a two-day summit in Brussels.  The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, include changes to migrant welfare payments, safeguards for Britain's financial services and making it easier to block unwanted EU regulations.  Some Conservative MPs have announced their intention to back the prime minister. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in.  But many Conservatives have announced they will back the leave campaign including Mr Cameron's long-time ally, Justice Secretary Michael Gove.  London Mayor Boris Johnson, who has previously been a Eurosceptic, has yet to declare where he stands.  On Sunday, he is expected to confirm he will campaign for out, but has told friends he is genuinely conflicted, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says.  Number 10 is resigned to him opposing them following a meeting this week, at which he was disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans, our editor adds.  Mr Johnson has also discussed his decision with Mr Gove.  According to the latest opinion polls, the British public are thought to be fairly evenly split.  Despite the polite promises of civilised debate, Mr Cameron is risking the unity of his party with the referendum.  Cabinet ministers like Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove, finally allowed to speak out today, rushed straight from Downing Street to work the phones for one of the leave campaigns.  The gang of six who posed awkwardly for photographs could well become seven when Boris Johnson breaks his continuing silence.  But whatever the individual calculations, expressions of opinion on either side are dwarfed by what today's announcement finally confirms - that in 123 days British voters have the chance to choose to step away from one of the institutions that has shaped our laws, and all of our lives, for more than 40 years.  In his statement, Mr Cameron warned that leaving the EU would be a "leap in the dark" as he urged voters to back his reform deal.  "The choice is in your hands - but my recommendation is clear. I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union."  Home Secretary Theresa May said the EU was far from perfect but "for reasons of security, protection against crime and terrorism, trade with Europe, and access to markets around the world" it was in the national interest to remain in.  Mr Gove said it had been the most difficult decision of his career to go against the prime minister, but he believed "our country would be freer, fairer and better off outside the EU". He added: "Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity."  Commons leader Chris Grayling, another leave campaign backer, said: "I actually believe the EU is holding this country back. We cannot control our borders, limit the number of people who come here do trade deals.  "I do not believe we can take decisions in the national interest when we are part of the European Union."  He said the prime minister had "put in a Herculean effort to try to deliver change" to Britain's relationship with the EU, but the "concessions" he had brought back from Brussels did not "give us the opportunity to take decisions in the national interest" without consulting Brussels.  Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Employment Minster Priti Patel, who is not a full cabinet member but attends meetings, have also joined the leave campaign.  Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom - who is not a member of the cabinet - will also back the leave campaign.  The rest of the cabinet joined Mr Cameron in the remain camp, including Business Secretary Sajid Javid - previously seen as a potential leave supporter.  The UK held a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU. The vote was in favour of staying in, but there have been growing calls from the public and politicians for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years.  The organisation has extended its control and now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport and consumer rights.  David Cameron initially resisted calls for another vote, but in 2013 he changed his mind. At the last election he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of a public vote to decide whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.  Mr Cameron claims his EU reform deal will give Britain "special status" within the bloc - tackling concerns over migrants getting "something for nothing" from the benefit system and exempting the country from the EU drive for "ever-closer union".  But critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration or take back powers from Brussels.  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: "The 23rd is our golden opportunity, let battle be joined. Mr Cameron keeps on telling us that Britain would be better in a 'reformed Europe'. But he fails to point out that there is no reformed European Union on offer here. The prime minister's EU deal is pathetic."  Britain Stronger in Europe released a campaign video accusing leave campaigners of "utter hypocrisy" for attacking Mr Cameron's deal, claiming that many of them have been calling for the same reforms.  The key points of Mr Cameron's reform deal are:  The Labour Party is officially campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, although a small group of the party's backbenchers have joined the leave campaign.  Leader Jeremy Corbyn voted for Britain to leave the European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, in 1975 but has since changed his mind, arguing that "it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers".  He branded Mr Cameron's negotiations a "sideshow" aimed at appeasing critics in the Conservative Party and said he had missed an opportunity to protect jobs and "stop the spread of low pay".  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a statement the SNP will be "leading the positive case to keep Scotland in the EU".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35620821	EU deal: What will it mean for Cameron at home and abroad?	David Cameron will now begin the campaign that will define his legacy and his time in office.  The battleground for the next four months has been laid out. The prime minister and the "in" campaign will insist that the UK's relationship with the EU has been fundamentally changed, with several key demands met.  But those who want to leave the UK say it is a "hollow deal", that the negotiations were weak in their ambition and Britain has not regained control over its laws or its borders.  They question whether the emergency brake on migrant benefits will have any impact on immigration numbers - and point out that the legislation on this will have to be passed by the European Parliament only AFTER Britain has voted in a referendum.  And the critics whose ambition is to see powers being returned to Westminster will also point out that the UK has not regained the right to over-rule EU laws.  So that is the battleground at home but Mr Cameron had also claimed there "was a big prize for everyone in the room" in fundamentally reforming the EU.  But the other member states did not choose to seize this moment to embrace wider reforms, underscoring that Britain remains exceptional, the outsider.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the settlement addressed all of the Prime Minister's concerns "without compromising our fundamental values".  For the rest of the EU that was crucial. There was the will to help David Cameron but the other leaders were not prepared to weaken the EU's core beliefs.  Freedom of movement has not been compromised. The march towards deeper integration has not been slowed.  The President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be "no power of veto over the eurozone" - not that Britain was seeking that.  What the French wanted to underline was that Britain would not win any "exceptions to the rules of the EU" - particularly in relation to regulation in the City.  Even so some European leaders are uncomfortable. This deal recognises that there are different layers of integration.  Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: "There is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream."  Belgium was greatly exercised that other countries might want to opt out from further integration.  There is an underlying fear of contagion that other countries might seek similar opt-outs, so leading to an unravelling of the EU.  In the end, the political battle will almost certainly not be fought on the details of this deal.  It will be fought over the economic risks of leaving the EU and whether the UK can regain control over its laws and borders.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33141819	EU referendum timeline: Countdown to the vote	David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU - seen as the biggest political decision in decades. Here are the key events leading up to and beyond - the date.  There have been calls for a referendum on whether or not the UK should be in the EU almost since the original referendum back in 1975. click here for the history of calls for another EU vote  In a long awaited speech Prime Minister David Cameron says that if the Conservatives win the next election they would seek to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU and then give the British people the "simple choice" by the end of 2017 between staying in the EU under those terms or leaving the EU. His speech comes against a background of polls suggesting UK Independence Party support at 10%. Read full story on the speech.  The European Union Referendum Bill was unveiled in the Queen's Speech. This is the UK legislation required to allow the referendum to take place. It has now cleared Parliament and become law, after the government twice saw off attempts in the House of Lords to lower the proposed voting age in the in-out poll to 16. At the same time as the bill made its parliamentary journey, Mr Cameron was seeking approval from other EU leaders for the reforms he wants to achieve before the referendum can take place.  The first EU summit after David Cameron won an unexpected majority in the UK general election. The summit ended up being dominated by the migrant crisis and Greek debt crisis. But Mr Cameron used the meeting - made up of all the EU's heads of state - to formally set out his aims. Speaking after it, he said he was delighted the process of "reform and renegotiation" of the UK's membership of the EU was "properly under way".  A new group charged with handling issues relating to the EU referendum began its work. Headed by British official Jonathan Faull, it reports to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  Some thought this would be the summit that Mr Cameron sealed the deal with his EU counterparts, but that turned out to be a bit premature. Instead EU leaders had their first "frank" discussions about the UK requests including Mr Cameron's attempts to convince sceptical EU leaders to accept his plans to limit benefits for migrants - one of the key sticking points in the renegotiations. European Council President Donald Tusk said the discussions should "pave the way" for a deal by February.  David Cameron says Conservative ministers will be able to campaign to leave the EU while remaining in the government. However, he says this suspension of the normal rules of collective ministerial responsibility will only apply once agreement on a deal with the rest of the EU is reached.  A landmark moment as the European Council publishes a draft blueprint for the proposed changes to the UK's membership of the EU. The document includes a so-called emergency brake on the payment of in-work benefits and powers for the UK Parliament to join with other countries to block EU regulations. David Cameron says the detail needs to be ironed out but the settlement is the best he could have achieved from a "standing start" and is worth "fighting for". Home Secretary Theresa May says the package offers the "basis for a deal" but many Tory colleagues disagree, saying the PM failed to get nearly all the objectives he originally set out in his 2013 Bloomberg speech.  Defending the package in the House of Commons, the prime minister insists it will see powers returned to the UK Parliament in a string of areas and will leave Britain "better and stronger". But the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who Out campaigners are looking to join their side, says that the PM is making "the best of a bad job" and more guarantees are needed over enhanced sovereignty.  After round-the-clock negotiations in Brussels, David Cameron gets the 27 other EU member states to sign up to a package of reforms. He does not get everything he wanted - he has to water down some of the welfare curbs at the insistence of Eastern European members - but he does get an exemption from "ever closer union" and the four year ban on in-work benefits for new arrivals. He claims the deal tackles the British public's "frustrations" with the EU and ensures the country will never be part of an EU "superstate" - but critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration and take powers back from Brussels.  David Cameron says the UK's in/out referendum will be held on 23 June this year - as widely predicted. If he had not got a deal on 18-19 February he would have had to to return to Brussels at the end of February for a special summit or wait until the next scheduled gathering at the start of March.  His cabinet colleagues start to come out in favour or against Britain's membership as the rival campaigns kick into top gear.  David Cameron makes a statement to Parliament, allowing MPs to debate the deal he has reached in Brussels and the choice facing the British people in the referendum.  Secondary legislation is due to be laid before Parliament paving the way for a referendum. The Electoral Commission will designate the official Leave and Remain campaigns, which will get access to public funds, a £7m spending limit and TV broadcasts.  The government ruled out holding the EU referendum on on 5 May, the same day as elections to devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and for London's mayor.  But the SNP has argued that holding the EU vote at the end of June will still conflict with Scottish election campaign. Voters in many English local authorities will also go to the polls, making 5 May the biggest set of elections - outside of a general election - for some years.  Britain goes to the polls to answer the question: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"  In the event of a Leave vote, a country can withdraw from the EU two years after notifying the European Council of its intention to leave. However, leaving would still involve "complex and probably lengthy negotiations", a Parliamentary briefing paper concluded. Talks would be held on the future of the UK's relationship with the EU, including whether it could still have access to the single market. Resolving all this could take some time. David Cameron has promised to step down as Conservative leader before the next general election in 2020, meaning that - whatever the outcome of the referendum - this period is likely to be dominated by the race to succeed him.  French presidential elections take place in May 2017. The UK government had been keen to get its EU negotiations wrapped up by this time for fear of Mr Cameron's demands being trumped by French domestic politics, with candidates seeking to win favour at home with a tough stance against the UK. German parliamentary elections take place in September 2017. This was also close to the final date Mr Cameron could have held a referendum - having promised one by the end of 2017	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35620627	EU summit: High stakes and missed meals	Marathon talks have concluded in Brussels between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and 27 other European Union leaders nailing down a renegotiated UK-EU relationship. Mr Cameron will now use the deal to campaign in the UK's forthcoming referendum on whether to stay in the union.  We look at how the talks unfolded.  Arriving at the summit, Mr Cameron tells reporters: "I'll be battling for Britain. If we can get a good deal, I'll take that deal - but I will not take a deal that doesn't meet what we need. I think it's much more important to get this right than to do anything in a rush."  He is reported to have packed three shirts for the conference and to have told his wife and the children that he might not be back for the weekend.  But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is upbeat, describing himself as "quite confident" of a deal.  The mood in Brussels is that this is a "now or never" summit - "The mood around town is that people think that if we don't get it solved now, we're never going to solve it," a senior EU diplomat tells reporters.  EU Council President Donald Tusk, chair of the summit, meets Mr Cameron before the official start, warning "this is a make or break summit".  Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite predicts there will be a squall but no fatal storm. "I think everybody will have their own drama and then we'll agree," she tells reporters.  Mr Tusk schedules wrap-up talks over an "English breakfast" for Friday morning and the meeting begins at 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT).  The breakfast triumph looks unlikely after officials confess little or no progress has been made in the first round of talks, which lasted two and a half hours.  "Sometimes, some issues and details that come up at sherpa [preparation] meetings, then disappear. This was not the case: everybody asked about everything," the BBC's Simon Wilson reports.  Downing Street officials say there remain five key areas of difference, including whether child benefit cuts can be applied retroactively and how long any restrictions on in work benefits can last.  Britain and France also push for any deal to include an assurance that this would be a final offer and could not be revisited. One official says there's no "sense that gaps in key issues have narrowed... there's a lot of hard work to do overnight".  A series of bilateral talks begins just before 03:00. Mr Cameron and Mr Tusk continue the talks until 05:30 local time (04:30 GMT).  Proceedings take a surreal turn when one EU official tries to explain the linguistic vagaries of one particular sticking point - the issue of "ever closer union", an EU principle which Mr Cameron questions.  "Every lawyer in Europe agrees 'ever closer union' doesn't mean anything. It's just a nice phrase.  "Only two places share an opposite interpretation - Britain and Belgium. But politically they look at it in opposite ways."  Reuters reports that a senior EU negotiator explains the dilemma is like Renee Magritte's surreal painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe.  "We need to find a common understanding... which reflects on the one hand the legal dimension of it - Ceci n'est past une pipe, you cannot really smoke it... - but it's true, when you look at it, you see a pipe."  Mr Tusk says talks have made "some progress, but a lot remains to be done".  The triumphant breakfast announcement is shelved, with talks resuming at 11:00 local time. For Mr Cameron, this means only three hours' sleep.  Several countries are taking issue with his demand that an emergency brake on in-work benefits for migrants should be in place for 13 years. The emergency brake is to be used when migration reaches "exceptional" levels.  "Eastern European countries, southern European countries, if they come home as prime ministers and tell their parliament that their citizens in Britain are for a long time citizens second class [sic], then they will have difficulties to explain that," says German MEP Elmar Brok.  Summit meals are scheduled and rescheduled as time ticks on with no final agreement.  "The situation is critical," one official says. "The session scheduled for 4pm [15:00 GMT] has just been cancelled and the meeting of leaders has been postponed to dinner at the earliest, and they have been asked to book hotels for tomorrow."  Greece throws a last-minute spanner in the works, saying it wants a curb on migrants over its border with Macedonia or it will not sign any deal.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is spotted nipping out for chips.  The EU leaders sit down to a 19:00 meal and a draft deal, which finally gets pushed through.  "Agreement #UKinEU done. Drama over," the Lithuanian president tweets moments after the dinner begins. The curtain has come down on the drama she predicted at the start. Mr Cameron is free to return home, where the next stage begins.	politics

At that time, 100,000 ballot papers were sent out, and of the 14,000 which were returned, 81% people voted to leave the European Union.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35616768	EU deal gives UK special status, says David Cameron	David Cameron says a deal struck with EU leaders will give the UK "special status" and he will campaign with his "heart and soul" to stay in the union.  The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits.  It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to "ever closer union" with other EU member states, he said.  EU exit campaigners said the "hollow" deal offered only "very minor changes".  Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June.  Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump.  The key points of the deal are:  The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members.  Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.  On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.  The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: "Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU."  German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would "elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU".  Mr Tusk said it "strengthens Britain's special status", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as "fair".  Mr Tusk added: "We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity.  "I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people."  The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him.  The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement.  The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK.  The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto.  But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing.  Mr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK "in the driving seat" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a "more flexible" EU.  "We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it," he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU "has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency".  The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: "Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate."  Outlining his case to remain "in a reformed Europe", Mr Cameron said "turning our back on the EU is no solution at all".  "We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey," he added.  "The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country."  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a "sideshow" designed to "appease his opponents in the Conservative Party," adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay.  "We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers," he said.  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now "more important than ever" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case "as strongly as possible".  Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration.  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron "will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one".  UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: "This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing £55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity."  As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster.  Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain "to take control of its own destiny", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was "absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy".  Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a "special guest" at the rally, describing him as a "towering figure on the left of British politics".

Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health president Prof Neena Modi said the system was unfair on call handlers, who are not medically trained.  She said even clinicians would find it hard to assess small children by phone.  NHS England acknowledged the importance of thorough training but said the royal colleges helped produce the protocols.  A report last month by NHS England described how NHS 111 missed chances to save 12-month-old William Mead, from Cornwall, who died in 2014 from blood poisoning following a chest infection after staff failed to recognise the seriousness of his condition.  NHS England has said call handlers for the 111 service should be trained on how to recognise a complex call and when to call in clinical advice earlier.  The government has said this will happen as soon as possible.  But the NHS England report concluded that if a medic had taken the final phone call, instead of an NHS 111 adviser using a computer system, they probably would have realised William's "cries as a child in distress" meant he needed urgent medical attention.  In an interview with the Press Association, Prof Modi said: "It is uncertain - because studies have not been adequately conducted - whether or not the telephone triage service, such as NHS 111, is really going to be safe and effective for very small children.  "Even a clinician trying to make an assessment over the telephone would find it much more difficult in a smaller child than in an older child.  "Then when you add in the lack of clinical expertise, it's going to be even more difficult.  "I feel really sorry for the call handlers because they are being placed in a position that really it's questionable that they should be placed in."  The RCPCH president said 111 had been brought in at huge cost without proper evaluation of whether it was a safe service.  "We are saying that the time to do an evaluation is not after you've spent millions of pounds in introducing a system. You want to do that up front, beforehand."  She said patients were better cared for when they could contact a family doctor.  "If you were to be able to speak to a general practitioner who knew your family, knew you and your kids, they would have a much better understanding and insight into the seriousness of the condition that you were phoning up about.  "If you phone up a GP surgery and you either get directed to NHS 111 or you get directed to a deputising [out-of-hours] service, and you speak to, or see, someone who doesn't know you, doesn't know your family and your children, it's going to be much more difficult for that person to make a judgement."  William's mother, Melissa, called 111 on the day before William's death and also spoke to an out-of-hours GP who had no access to his medical records.  She has welcomed Prof Modi's comments and said: "I found the out-of-hours system that I used with William on the Saturday (the day before he died) to be chaotic.  "At the time I did not know that the call handler that I was talking to wasn't assessing my call properly. So when I called at the time, I assume I'm ringing a safe helpline that will signpost me in the right direction of care required based upon my conversation with that person."  "If I had been able to take William to the GP that I saw the previous evening I would have done that.  "Knowing that he had seen William within the last 18 hours, that would have been more efficient, and the GP would have been better placed to make an informed judgement and more decisive action in William's care."  NHS England said in a statement that Prof Modi was entitled to her opinion but pointed out that the 111 clinical protocols had been designed "with and by the medical royal colleges, including her own".  It added: "It's important all staff working in children's services, primary care, NHS 111 and out-of-hours GP services are trained in the latest sepsis guidance regularly.  "We're also ensuring when people call NHS 111 they are supported by a wider range of doctors, nurses and other clinical staff, thereby improving around-the-clock care."	health

But, up and down the country, there are also charities and voluntary organisations dedicated to helping those who have developed mental health problems.  One in that army of volunteers is Tom McAlpine, who set-up the MoodSwings charity in Manchester in 1999 with a belief that it is possible for those suffering even severe mental health issues to make a good recovery.  Tom and his group have helped thousands over the years and some say he has literally save their lives.  Explained: What is mental health and where can I go for help?

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35608992	Virtually all hospitals now in deficit	Nearly every hospital in England is now in deficit as financial problems in the NHS threaten to spiral out of control.  Of the 138 hospital trusts, just seven are still in surplus according to the 2015-16 third quarter accounts, which cover April to December.  The figures also showed a total NHS trust overspend of £2.26bn once ambulance, mental health and community services were taken into account.  Experts said performance was deteriorating at an "alarming rate".  The deficit is already nearly triple what it was for the whole of the 2014-15 - and means the NHS is on track for one of its largest ever overspends.  The figures - released by NHS regulators Monitor and the Trust Development Authority - cover 240 trusts in total, which between them they account for about two-thirds of the NHS's £116bn budget.  The rest is spent on other areas including GPs, drug prescribing, public health and training.  Adam Roberts, of the Health Foundation think tank, said: "These figures are beyond dire. A comprehensive national plan is urgently needed."  The situation raises the prospect of the Department of Health failing to balance the overall books, which would be a huge embarrassment given the extra money the NHS is getting.  In autumn's spending review the government announced the NHS would get an extra £8.4bn this Parliament. A big chunk of that, £3.8bn, is being put in next year.  Hospitals and other health services are not like a businesses. They're not going to just go bust as the government can always step in.  But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to the early 1950s to find a similar scale of overspending - and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.  This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The government has promised the NHS extra money in the coming years to help it cope with demand and transform itself to become fit for the 21st century.  But if that goes on paying off debts, the NHS will be on the back foot straight away. The risk then is that a vicious circle develops with the service never quite being able to catch up. If that happens, the choices are stark: spend even more or cut back.  Last year the NHS finished over £800m in the red - with the health service as a whole balancing the books only after a cash injection from the Treasury and by raiding the capital budget earmarked for buildings.  The financial report released said the NHS was on track for a £2.8bn deficit which, if savings could be made in the final three months, could be brought down to under £2.4bn.  Overspending on agency staff has been highlighted as one of the major problems as well as rising demand for services.  The news comes at a difficult time for the NHS. Performance is already suffering with many of the major targets, including ones for A&E, ambulances, routine operations and cancer care, being missed.  Jim Mackey, from the regulators, said the figures were "disappointing" but maintained there were signs trusts were beginning make savings.  But Paul Healy, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said there was a limit to how much individual organisations could do.  He said transforming the system to reduce the demand on hospitals by keeping people well in the community was now an "absolute necessity".	health

The Lib Dems went from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight in May, triggering the resignation of leader Nick Clegg.  The party's election review said its move into coalition with the Tories had not been "well understood".  It also blamed a "confusing" campaign.  After the Lib Dems joined the Tory-led coalition in 2010, Mr Clegg was made deputy prime minister, with several high-profile ministerial roles taken by Lib Dems.  The review said Lib Dem members agreed the party was right to join the coalition "in the national interest" but said it had "singularly failed at using our new position to garner support, retain and communicate our vision, or maintain a unique offer".  Ditching the party's key pledge to scrap tuition fees "significantly damaged" the Lib Dems' reputation and credibility, the review concluded, saying it was "almost incomprehensible" that 27 MPs voted in favour of an increase despite the "carefully-negotiated" coalition agreement allowing them to abstain.  Other factors blamed for the loss of support were a lack of financial resources and campaigns with differing messages in different parts of the country as well as "ageing members and deflated morale" among activists.  "For some MPs, local leadership took a back seat to the demands of Westminster," it added.  When it came to the general election, the review said no party had a response to the Tories' message warning of a Labour alliance with the SNP, and criticised the Lib Dems' "fast-changing, complicated messages".  The review - carried out by members of the party's Campaigns and Communications Committee - made a string of recommendations to help the party fare better in any future coalition.  These include that Lib Dems should make it clear they will only automatically vote for legislation covered by the coalition agreement, and that the "wider party" should be represented in the negotiations.  Tim Farron, who replaced Mr Clegg as leader, said: "Blame and criticism can provide short term satisfaction, but do nothing for a future vision.  "This report is about setting a way forward, recognising the mistakes we made, and learning from them."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35607317	New blood test to detect inherited heart conditions	A new blood test could help diagnose people with inherited heart conditions, the British Heart Foundation has said.  Researchers funded by the charity found that by looking at a specific group of genes they were able to reliably detect underlying problems.  It follows the death of Sir David Frost's son Miles, who died suddenly from a condition thought to have been inherited from his father.  His family aims to raise £1.5m to make genetic testing available in the UK.  The eldest son of the late presenter and broadcaster died last year, aged 31, when he was out jogging near his family's home in Oxfordshire.  He was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Previous genetic tests looked at a small number of genes and were only able to identify specific conditions, leading to higher costs and longer diagnosis time - a major barrier to rolling the test out across the NHS.  But researchers from Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre say the new test, which looks at 147 genes, is quicker and more reliable.  It has already been rolled out at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust in Middlesex, with around 40 patients per month being successfully tested.  Dr James Ware, a consultant cardiologist specialising in inherited heart conditions, said: "Without a genetic test we often have to keep the whole family under regular surveillance for many years. This is hugely costly for both the families and the health system.  "By contrast, when a genetic test reveals the precise genetic abnormality causing the condition in one member of the family, it becomes simple to test other family members. Those who do not carry the faulty gene copy can be reassured and spared countless hospital visits."  The research has been funded by the British Heart Foundation and the findings published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research.	health

From listening to music and running, to colouring a picture and spending time with your family, you have sent us your photos and messages of your personal stories and how you manage day-to-day.  To bring more awareness of mental health issues, Josh recorded a video on YouTube about suffering from depression.  "I wouldn't wish depression on my worst enemy," he says.  "You shouldn't be ashamed to say you have depression - you are not alone."  But she gives a tongue-in-cheek warning. "Running can be addictive," says the 36-year-old.  "Competitiveness can take hold and once you enter races, you are at risk of developing an awesome sense of fun, and a sense of achievement, as well as building camaraderie, determination and resilience."  Megan says her illness is "debilitating".  "There are good and bad periods. It's like there is someone living in your brain constantly telling you how useless you are.  "Colouring and baking have helped me to relax and distract my brain from negative thoughts."  Jennifer Rowland, Crewe: "Make sure you eat at least two meals a day - meals, not junk food. Look out of the window, got outside, remember the world outside your own head. Talk to your friends. Don't tell just one person everything, tell a few people some things that are on your mind. Smile at a stranger."  Laura, London: "At the end of each day, write a list of positive things from the day. Maybe something you've enjoyed, a compliment, something you achieved, or something beautiful you saw. Try to think of three, or more if you can. I write them on my phone - I've downloaded a diary app that reminds me."  Gemma Wilson, Tameside: "I keep a box that holds positive memories like a favourite perfume or body spray, a song or album, maybe even a good book/DVD that helps escape from reality for a little while. The slightest break gives you time to try and readjust enough to maybe think a little clearer."  Nineteen-year-old George Hodgson describes how his anxiety affected him.  "I couldn't leave my bedroom let alone the house, until I became so mentally ill, I had to go and see a specialist.  "Eventually after months and months of seeing a psychiatrist and a cognitive behavioural therapist, there was light at the end of the tunnel and I started my recovery.  "During this period I had the idea of Maison de Choup, my fashion label born out of my anxiety."  Rachel, Sandy, Bedfordshire: "Break things down into small, manageable chunks, with a reward for yourself for each thing you complete, even if that is just getting out of bed."  "I struggle with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder," says Charlotte.

Cancer Research UK and the UK Health Forum worked out the likely impact of the tax on eating habits and, ultimately, the nation's waistlines.  Their report said such a tax would also save the NHS £10m a year by 2025.  The government is considering the measure, but soft drinks companies say other options would be more effective.  People get between 12% and 15% of their energy from sugar, but official recommendations say it should be less than 5%.  The statisticians modelled the impact of the tax and predicted a 16% reduction in the number of cans of pop consumed.  Their figures were then adjusted to account for the food and drink people might turn to instead.  They concluded a tax would lead to people consuming on average 15 fewer calories per day.  While the difference sounds tiny, the model predicts a large impact on waistlines.  Currently, 29% of people are obese and trends suggest that figure will reach 34% in 2025.  Rather than reverse the obesity epidemic, the forecast predicts the tax would lead to obesity rates levelling off at around 29% - preventing 3.7 million people from becoming obese.  Alison Cox, from Cancer Research UK, said: "The ripple effect of a small tax on sugary drinks is enormous.  "These numbers make it clear why we need to act now before obesity becomes an even greater problem."  And Jane Landon, from the UK Health Forum, argued: "Countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks have not only reduced consumption, they have raised much-needed revenues for public health measures."  The report has come out as the government is preparing its obesity strategy, which is due in the next few weeks.  Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have indicated all options are on the table, including a sugar tax.  A report by Public Health England said a sugary drinks tax would cut sugar consumption "at least in the short term".  And TV chef Jamie Oliver has campaigned for the tax saying it was the "single most important" change that could be made.  The director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, said: "The hypothetical claims made in this modelling study run contrary to real-world evidence.  "In fact, the soft drinks tax in Mexico has reduced average calorie intake by six calories per person per day, with no evidence that it has reduced levels of obesity."  He added that other options such as reducing portion sizes or changing ingredients would be more effective.  Why is sugar so addictive?  Michael Mosley on how much sugar is in food	health

The claims - made by Channel 4 - allege that some bills were wrongly declared in the party's spending returns.  The commission said it would look at bills for two hotels in the Kent constituency.  A Conservative spokesman said spending was all legal and "correctly recorded".  During last year's election UKIP's Nigel Farage lost out in the race for South Thanet seat to the Conservative Party's Craig Mackinlay.  The rules around candidate spending and any potential criminal offence can only be investigated by the police under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 - not the Electoral Commission.  But while the commission has no powers to investigate or sanction alleged candidate spending offences, it does have powers in relation to national campaign spending.  Kent Police says it will not pursue an investigation over individual candidate spending in Thanet South during the commission's review.  "At this stage the matter will sit with the Electoral Commission. Kent Police officers will liaise closely with the Electoral Commission and investigate if appropriate," a spokeswoman said.  The commission said it would specifically consider whether stays at the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate and the Premier Inn in Margate, should have been included in national campaign spending or not.  "The investigation opened by the commission today focuses on whether the Conservative Party met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act," a statement said.  The commission's sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000.  The allegations were first made by on 20 January and relate to how much an individual can spend on their campaign during an election.  The commission said that during what was defined as the "short campaign" - which ran from 30 March to 7 May - £8,700 could be spent, plus 6p for every "registered parliamentary elector".  In his blog Michael Crick - the political correspondent for Channel 4 - said the legal expense limit in Thanet South for that period was £15,016.	politics

The so-called never events included the case of a man who had a whole testicle removed rather than just a cyst.  In another, a woman's fallopian tubes were taken out instead of her appendix.  NHS England insisted such events were rare, but the Patients Association said they were a "disgrace".  Other "never events" included the wrong legs, eyes or knees being operated on and hundreds of cases of foreign objects such as scalpels being left inside bodies after operations.  The Press Association analysis also found that patients' lives were put in danger when feeding tubes were put into their lungs instead of their stomachs.  Patients were given the wrong type of blood during transfusions and others were given the wrong drugs or doses of drugs.  The analysis showed there were:  Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: "It is a disgrace that such supposed 'never' incidents are still so prevalent.  "How are such basic, avoidable mistakes still happening? There is clearly a lack of learning in the NHS.  "It is especially unforgivable to operate on the wrong organ, and many such mistakes can never be rectified."  NHS England insisted never events were rare - affecting one in every 20,000 procedures - and that the majority of the 4.6 million hospital operations each year were safe.  A spokeswoman said: "One never event is too many and we mustn't underestimate the effect on the patients concerned.  "To better understand the reasons why, in 2013 we commissioned a taskforce to investigate, leading to a new set of national standards being published last year specifically to support doctors, nurses and hospitals to prevent these mistakes.  "Any organisation that reports a serious incident is also expected to conduct its own investigation so it can learn and take action to prevent similar incidents from being repeated."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35596475	Under-18 models may be banned from catwalk	A ban on models aged under 18 from the catwalk is expected to be recommended by MPs later this month, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. But will this protect models, and the people who admire them, from problems like eating disorders?  Model Rosie Nelson was a size eight when she says she was told by a top agency to get thinner. So she dieted and exercised until her ribs were sticking out.  "I went back four months later and they said, 'We just want you to get down to the bone.' I just sat there and thought, 'I can't lose any more weight, I've lost pretty much everything.' I was skin and bone at that point," she says.  Ms Nelson started a petition calling for better healthcare in the modelling industry, which attracted 119,000-signatures. In December, she presented it to Parliament with Caroline Nokes, a Conservative MP who is leading an inquiry into body image.  Very thin models concern many people both in and out of the fashion industry because of the health implications for the girls and women and the message it sends to those who admire them.  The MPs' inquiry followed the collapse of a voluntary code of conduct introduced a decade ago to keep young teens off the catwalk. But models as young as 14 have continued to appear at London Fashion Week.  The inquiry team is expected to recommend at the end of the month that under-18s should be barred.  "Legislation is what would, at a stroke, make sure that you weren't seeing 15 to 18-year-olds with a BMI of 15.6 being told they had to lose weight," Ms Nokes told the BBC in December.  Ms Nelson says the move would change designers' approaches: "I think on the catwalk especially, under-18 is too young, it does encourage a boyish look - a boy's body is quite straight and women do have hips, it's just how we naturally are.  "Having a girl who is underdeveloped and skinny, when we're modelling womenswear, it's not representing women."  Other countries including France and Italy have already legislated in this area, with France creating rules about a minimum body mass index for models and Italy demanding health certificates.  A minimum body mass index had been suggested for the UK - but Ms Nelson and others do not think that would work.  "You can stick numbers on anyone but it doesn't represent their body type, how tall they are really, what their body looks like. So I have a very low BMI but I am still told I am too heavy for some jobs," she says.  It was ultra-skinny models that made British designers Rose and Willard make their own rules for photoshoots. They have added a clause to contracts that says models have to eat when working for them.  Heidy Rehman, founder and managing director said: "We had one model come in for a test shoot - she was hungry - but about three in the afternoon she was delirious, holding on to something. We had to send her home.  "The demand for how a model looks comes from the designer so what we're saying is we're not going to be part of that demand."  But she does not necessarily agree that banning under-18s from the catwalk will work.  "It's good that this is being talked about at a high level, but over 50% of models start between 13-15. The industry will argue that it's being discriminated against because under-18s can work in other industries."  Melanie Rickey, a former model and fashion journalist also disagrees.  "The fashion industry is a very visible industry, it represents beauty, money, success. It's an easy fall guy for any of the issues that face young women today. There are pressures but it's the responsibility of the agent or the parent to keep an eye, no legislation is going to take that place."  She think changes will happen as the consumers for the shows themselves change.  "In the old days, pre-digital, fashion shows were for the industry. Since the digital age, with blogs and Instagram you can see any show instantly. The general public are much more aware, are watching them, and what they want is to see the clothes they're seeing on the catwalk in the shop tomorrow.  "If you look at the supermodels of now, the ones with the biggest Instagram accounts, like Gigi Hadid and they are 'normal'."  "I have a very strong suspicion when these shows become more commonplace, you and I won't want to see a 17-year old size six model wearing those clothes, we want to see a woman like us. This question is coming to the end of an era."  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

The research confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of two women who had had Zika-like symptoms during their pregnancies.  Brazilian experts say this suggests the virus can infect the foetus.  But WHO experts caution the link is not proven and expect to release more information in the next few weeks.  Brazil has seen a rise in microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads and, in some cases, problems with brain development - in the last year, at the same time as a rise in the number of people infected with Zika virus.  This has led to a number of studies investigating whether the virus is behind the rise.  The research, published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases, involved two women who had fever, rash and muscle aches during their pregnancies.  After ultrasound scans revealed their developing foetuses had microcephaly, scientists ran further amniocentesis checks.  This involved taking a small sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the foetus in the womb.  Genetic analysis of this fluid confirmed the presence of Zika virus - discounting similar viruses that may have been responsible.  Lead scientist, Dr Ana de Filippis, from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, said: "This study reports details of the Zika virus being identified directly in the amniotic fluid of a woman during her pregnancy, suggesting the virus could cross the placental barrier and potentially infect the foetus."  She added: "This study cannot determine whether the Zika virus identified in these two cases was the cause of microcephaly in the babies.  "Until we understand the biological mechanism linking Zika to microcephaly we cannot be certain that one causes the other, and further research is urgently needed."  Prof Jimmy Whitworth, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine added that while the research cannot prove the link: "This study does strengthen the body of evidence that Zika virus is the cause of foetal microcephaly in Brazil."  Separately the paper suggests that the virus looks genetically very similar to the Zika virus circulating in French Polynesia in 2013.  But scientists say despite growing research, a lot remains unknown and a number of questions still need urgent answers - including how big the risk of microcephaly is if a woman has Zika virus infection in pregnancy and whether the timing of the infection makes a difference.  Brazil, the country hardest-hit by Zika, has about 508 confirmed cases of microcephaly and is investigating about 3,935 suspected cases.  The ministry said last week that 41 of the confirmed cases of microcephaly had shown links to Zika infection.  Microcephaly can be caused by a range of factors, including genetic conditions, infections and drugs.  Experts say women who are pregnant are most at risk from mosquito-borne Zika and should try to protect themselves from mosquito bites.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32695399	Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe	David Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.  Mr Cameron said he did not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand before serious discussions get under way.  Through a series of speeches and newspaper articles, he has given an overview of his priorities but, and in November, he set down his objectives on paper for the first time in a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council.  His four key objectives are:  The Conservatives want to free business from red tape and "excessive interference" from Brussels and to provide access to new markets through "turbo charging" free trade deals with America and Asia.  They also want trade barriers in the services and digital sectors to be removed to create a truly single market as well as specific protections for the City of London.  They support continued enlargement of the EU to new members but with new mechanisms in place to "prevent vast migrations across the Continent".  The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.  But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules - amid pressure from trade unions to leave such protections intact.  The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: "If we can do it earlier we will." it is widely expected to be held in June or July if a deal is reached at the EU summit in February.  The Conservatives will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights.  The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.  David Cameron says that if necessary he would back a new law reasserting the power of the UK Parliament over the EU.  The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services. It is a "red line" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.  Mr Cameron's decision to seek the four year ban on some UK benefits for EU migrants was a way round it, but a number of EU countries - including Hungary and Poland - say they will not accept anything which discriminates against their nationals.  This has led to reports that the idea of an "emergency brake" to limit numbers when there has been a surge of migrants, might be back on the agenda.  In a speech in November 2014, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.  Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to "strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU".  But his spokesman reacted to the publication of Mr Cameron's negotiation objectives by warning that restrictions on benefits for new arrivals to the UK would be "highly problematic" as they affected the "fundamental freedoms of our internal market" and amounted to "direct discrimination between EU citizens".  The main sticking point has been opposition from countries including Hungary and Poland to the idea of the four year ban on claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU is that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals.  However David Cameron has said he is willing to consider alternatives that have the same impact on migration flows, while his EU colleagues have also said they want to come up with a deal which achieves the UK's aims.  Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will "rule nothing out" and he has no "emotional attachment" to the EU.  Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.  Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an "opt-out" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be "impossible" without Britain leaving the EU.  Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.  Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, had urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum despite Mr Cameron warning in January 2015 that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU - if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.  That position has now changed with Mr Cameron agreeing to allow cabinet ministers to campaign - in a personal capacity - on either side of the EU referendum campaign, once his renegotiation is over.  In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue.  Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum	politics

Action on Sugar analysed 131 hot drinks and found a third contained at least as much sugar as a can of Pepsi or Coca-Cola, which contains nine teaspoons.  The charity said in some of the worst cases the drinks contained 20 or more teaspoons of sugar.  Coffee shop chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffe Nero said they were committed to reducing sugar content in their drinks.  The drinks assessed included flavoured coffees such as mochas and lattes, hot fruit drinks and hot chocolates from coffee shops and fast food chains.  The charity found that 98% of the drinks tested would receive a red nutritional value label for high sugar content.  The recommended maximum intake of added sugar per day for those aged 11 and over is about 30g or seven teaspoons, the NHS says.  Starbucks' venti Grape with Chai, Orange and Cinnamon Hot Mulled Fruit was found to have the highest sugar content of the drinks tested, with 25 teaspoons of sugar per serving, the campaign group said.  Costa's massimo eat-in Chai Latte was found to contain 20 teaspoons of sugar and Starbucks' venti White Chocolate Mocha with Whipped Cream was found to have 18.  KFC's mocha and Starbucks' Signature Hot Chocolate both had 15 teaspoons of sugar per serving while Caffe Nero's drink-in Caramelatte had 13.  The group's researcher Kawther Hashem called on coffee shop chains to reduce the amount of sugar in their drinks, improve their labelling and scrap extra-large serving sizes.  "These hot flavoured drinks should be an occasional treat, not an everyday drink," she said.  "They are laden with an unbelievable amount of sugar and calories and are often accompanied by a high sugar and fat snack."  She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was "surprised" by the results, and said the campaign group had tested only the larger portion sizes on offer.  "I used to drink a large white cafe mocha with caramel and vanilla syrup, cream on top, caramel and chocolate drizzle at Starbucks - approximately three times a day, seven days a week.  "I did this for about a year. At the time, I knew this drink had lots of sugar and fat, but I wasn't aware of just how much.  "At one point the assistant manager refused to serve me because they were concerned of the health impact. The rest of the staff continued to serve me.  "I drastically cut back on these sugary drinks after I was diagnosed with a very high cholesterol level and liver problems three years ago.  "I still have high cholesterol now and was recently diagnosed with a fatty liver - which means it is not working properly - not from alcohol but from sugar.  "While I believe we should all take responsibility for our health, I do feel that coffee shops which allow their customers to customise their drinks to extreme levels are not helping."  Professor Graham MacGregor, Action on Sugar chairman, said the group's report highlighted "yet again another example of scandalous amounts of sugar added to our food and drink".  "No wonder we have the highest rates of obesity in Europe," he said.  A Starbucks spokeswoman said the chain had "committed to reduce added sugar" by 25% by the end of 2020 in its "indulgent drinks".  "We also offer a wide variety of lighter options, sugar-free syrups and sugar-free natural sweetener and we display all nutritional information in-store and online," she said.  Kerry Parkin, Costa's head of communications, said the chain had already taken "significant steps" to reduce the sugar content of its drinks.  The company would be setting salt and sugar reduction targets for 2020, she said.  A Caffe Nero spokeswoman said: "We have already made changes to reduce the sugar content of some of our iced drinks for summer 2016 by over 10%.  "In addition, we offer sugar free syrups for many drinks, and all nutritional information is available on our website so that customers can make an informed choice. This will remain a focus as we look at the sugar content in all our drinks over the coming years."  Do you regularly consume sugary drinks from High Street cafes?

In 2011-13 there were 603 cases diagnosed for every 100,000 Britons, compared with 540 in 1993-95 - when there were 253,000 diagnoses a year.  Experts say the rise is manly due to the ageing and growing population.  And while the chances of getting cancer have increased, they say the chance of surviving it has also improved.  But the charity warns despite more accurate tests, better treatments and many cancers being spotted earlier, there are some cancers where survival rates are still low.  More needs to be done to tackle survival rates for lung, pancreatic and oesophageal cancer as they tend to be diagnosed at a later stage when they are harder to treat, the report says.  Nick Ormiston-Smith, Cancer Research UK's head of statistical information, said: "People are living longer so more people are getting cancer.  "But the good news is more people are surviving their cancer.  "There is still a huge variation in survival between different cancer types and there's a lot of work to do to reach Cancer Research UK's ambition for three in four patients to survive their disease by 2034."  Prof Peter Johnson, also from the charity, added: "People often think cancer is down to their genes or just bad luck.  "Although genes do play a role there are still many things people can do to reduce their cancer risk.  "The most important is not to smoke. Most people know smoking causes lung cancer, but it is also linked to at least 13 other types.  "We also know that maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising and eating a healthy balanced diet is important."	health

Here he shares some facts and figures about what makes the human brain one of the most complex structures in the world.  The report contains detailed shots of the human brain from the start.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35552030	Why brains are beautiful	When I picked up the human brain in my hands, several things ran through my mind. My immediate concern was I might drop it or that it would fall apart in my hands - fortunately neither happened.  Second, I was struck by how light the human brain is. I should say this was half a brain - the right hemisphere - the left had already been sent for dissection. The intact human brain weighs only around 3lbs (1.5kg) - just 2% of body-weight, and yet it consumes 20% of its energy.  The brain I was holding had been steeped in formalin, a preserving fluid, for about three weeks and is one of several hundred brains donated every year for medical research.  It was only after I'd got used to the feel of the brain in my hands that I could then start to wonder about how such a simple-looking structure could be capable of so much.  This brain had experienced, processed, interpreted an entire human life - the thoughts, emotions, language, memory, emotion, cognition, awareness, and consciousness - all the things that make us human and each of us unique.  You may think yuck, but I'm with the scientists and surgeon who declare: "Brains are beautiful".  The pathology team at the Bristol Brain Bank had kindly allowed us to film as part of the BBC "In the Mind" season, looking at many aspects of mental health.  My brief was to examine some of the latest advances in neuroscience.  There is a genuine sense of excitement among researchers about the direction and progress being made in our knowledge of the brain.  Fifteen years ago scientists knew that there were strong familial, inherited elements to some types of mental illness.  They also could see that some medications for mental illness were effective, but could not explain the mechanisms involved.  Now, in schizophrenia alone, more than 100 genes have been implicated and the language of brain circuits has arrived.  Several distinct conditions of the mind - autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia - have been found to share some of the same genetic risk factors.  Prof Shitij Kapur, Dean of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London told me: "The brain used to be like a black box. Now we can explain why treatments work, and when you know that you can begin to design better ones."  Although many genes are known to increase a person's vulnerability to mental illness, what actually causes it is everything else - the experiences of life.  Prof Kapur put it like this: "It is humbling to know that genetics do not determine the outcome. You can have many of the genes of risk and not get the disorder and have none of them yet succumb to it."  Just as the Human Genome Project transformed knowledge of biology and genetics, a similar revolution is underway in scientific understanding of the brain.  The international Human Connectome Project (HCP) aims to unravel how the brain is wired and the function of neural networks.  Ed Bullmore, Prof of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, who is on the HCP advisory panel told me: "Connectome is a word that has only existed for about 10 years, and summarises the ambition that we might be able to map the entire network of the human brain; it is exciting to see that suddenly it looks like it might be possible."  The images produced by improved brain scanning techniques are stunning.  Thousands of thin coloured wires, like spaghetti, show the cabling of the human brain - with each wire representing a bundle of axons or nerve fibres.  The image is reminiscent of one of those depicting flight paths across the planet - all linked by a number of key airport hubs.  The brain also has several hubs - regions that are highly connected. Prof Bullmore explained that people with schizophrenia tend to have fewer brain hubs so their neural networks are somewhat less connected than would be found in a healthy brain.  By studying the development of brain networks in adolescence, when brain hubs are becoming strengthened and consolidated, Prof Bullmore and his team are hoping to unravel the developmental changes that contribute to mental illness.  He said: "If we can understand the genetic mechanisms that drive network development to go off on a different path that leads to schizophrenia, then we can design new drugs - not just those that damp down the symptoms of hallucinations and delusions, but we may be able to identify treatments that prevent an individual at risk of schizophrenia from developing the condition or to improve the long term prognosis of patients."  In another part of Cambridge, being gentled rocked inside an incubator at body temperature, I was able to see dozens of so-called organoids - miniature developing human brains.  These balls of tissue strongly mimic the early stages of foetal brain development - so represent another important approach towards enhancing our understanding of the most complex biological structure on the planet.  The technique for growing organoids was discovered by Madeline Lancaster, a developmental biologist, now based at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology.  Skin cells are taken from an adult donor and then reprogrammed to become early stage neurons. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are widely used in research to create patient-specific models of disease.  Madeline Lancaster devised the means to coax the cells to develop in 3D and, as a result, to become mini-brains.  When taken from patients with mental illness, they can be used to investigate the origins of their disease.  She told me: "The human brain is the organ which is most different from other forms of life and so some questions about how it functions and why it goes wrong just can't be answered in animal models such as rodents. We have high hopes that organoids can give us real insights into how mental illness develops.  "I think it is a really huge step towards some hopefully amazing breakthroughs in what has been a desert in the field of biomedicine. Mental health disorders have been really lacking in terms of new treatments to treat these really devastating disorders"  So when will this research lead to better treatments? Prof Kapur of King's College London urges patience.  He reminds me that the "war on cancer" was declared in 1971 (in a speech by President Nixon), and that it took three decades for major advances to reach most patients.  "In the next five to 10 years we'll be able to use genetics and neuroscience to target treatments better to patients. Based on the knowledge we have now we could also have new medications, not for an entire illness for a subset of autism or schizophrenia."  He also stressed that there is not a drug for everything: any new medications would be just part of the answer with psychological treatments playing a vital role in improving outcomes.  It was a privilege to be allowed to hold a human brain. The experience increased my respect for this piece of tissue, which can be so easily damaged with catastrophic consequences.  It also reinforced my sense of wonder at this masterpiece of evolution. Brains really are beautiful.	health

White blood cells were taken from patients with leukaemia, modified in the lab and then put back.  But the data has not been published or reviewed and two patients are said to have died from an extreme immune response.  Experts said the trial was exciting, but still only "a baby step."  The news bubbled out of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in Washington DC.  The lead scientist, Prof Stanley Riddell from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle, said all other treatments had failed in these patients and they had only two-to-five months to live.  He told the conference that: "The early data is unprecedented."  In the trial, cells from the immune system called killer t-cells were taken out of dozens of patients. The cells normally act like bombs destroying infected tissue.  The researchers genetically modified the t-cells to engineer a new targeting mechanism - with the technical name of chimeric antigen receptors - to target acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.  Prof Riddell told the BBC: "Essentially what this process does is, it genetically reprograms the T-cell to seek out and recognise and destroy the patient's tumour cells.  "[The patients] were really at the end of the line in terms of treatment options and yet a single dose of this therapy put more than ninety percent of these patients in complete remission where we can't detect any of these leukaemia cells."  But one cancer expert told me they still felt in the dark on the full significance of the study, as the data is not available.  Also seven of the patients developed cytokine release syndrome so severe that they required intensive care, and a further two patients died.  While those odds may be acceptable if facing terminal cancer, the side-effects are much greater than conventional leukaemia treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which work in the majority of patients.  The field of immunotherapy - harnessing the immune system to attack cancer - is coming of age.  The significance of today's development is hard to ascertain while the data is unpublished - but the field is undoubtedly making giant strides.  Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, take the brakes off the immune system so it attacks cancer.  They are already being used by doctors.  And other experimental techniques are coming to fruition to allow doctors to change a patient's own cells to engineer a designer immune system to kill cancer.  It's an exciting time that is likely to see immunotherapy soon join chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery as major weapons in the fight against cancer.  There is also a big difference between using such approaches on a blood cancer like leukaemia and "solid" tumours such as breast cancer.  Dr Alan Worsley, from Cancer Research UK, said that while the field was incredibly exciting, "this is a baby step".  He told the BBC: "We've been working for a while using this type of technology, genetically engineering cells. So far it's really shown some promise in this type of blood cancer.  "We should say that in most cases standard treatment for blood cancer is quite effective, so this is for those rare patients where that hasn't worked.  "The real challenge now is how do we get this to work for other cancers, how do we get it to work for what's known as solid cancers, cancers in the tissue?"  Are you a leukaemia patient? Do you have a family member who is terminally ill with leukaemia? What are your thoughts about the proposed new cancer therapy?

The Times reported that Mr O'Carroll joined the party in Barrow-in-Furness after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.  The constituency MP, John Woodcock, and deputy leader Tom Watson were among those to say he was not welcome.  A Labour spokesman said: "Tom O'Carroll has been suspended from the Labour Party."  Mr Woodcock had tweeted on Tuesday that he was "dismayed" Mr O'Carroll had joined the party, and said he had written to Labour's general secretary, Iian McNicol to ask for him to be banned for life.  Meanwhile, Mr Watson, Labour's deputy leader, said in a tweet: "Just picking up on the Tom O'Carroll story. Have to verify the facts but he is not welcome in the Labour Party and nor are his views."  Formed in 1974, the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) campaigned for "children's sexuality". It wanted the government to scrap or lower the age of consent.  In 1981, Mr O'Carroll, then PIE's chairman, was sentenced to two years in jail for "conspiracy to corrupt public morals". PIE was disbanded in 1984.  O'Carroll was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in 2006 for distributing child pornography images.	politics

But the mental-health impact of gang violence is much less understood.  Lucy is 26 and already she has lost 10 friends and relatives from gang violence.  She saw her first murder when she was playing in a park on a Sunday afternoon. Three gang members appeared and a fight broke out.  "I see my cousin on the floor with a screwdriver in his head and he died later on in hospital," she tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme.  Explained: What is mental health and where can I go for help?  In The Mind: BBC News special report (or follow "Mental health" tag in the BBC News app)  Lucy had thought she was growing up on a nice, quiet estate in Brixton, south London.  "Suddenly I learned about this life I never knew existed - always getting a call, or just hearing months later or sometimes immediately... that someone else has been killed that I know. It just made me more and more sad. That's when I started to get depression.  "If a year went by that someone didn't die, that was a good year, cos you ain't lost someone."  The most recent figures from the London Ambulance Service show 167 people were injured in knife incidents in the capital in October last year, while nine were injured by guns.  Metropolitan Police figures show there were 292 incidents of knife crime causing injury last December, and 302 in November.  Lucy says the incident that sticks in her mind is the murder of Zac Olumegbon, who was stabbed to death in front of his school in West Norwood, south London, when he was 15. Four teenagers were jailed for life for his murder.  "I got a ping on my BB [phone] to say he'd been killed. That had a really bad effect on me for at least a year. I was just so upset, depressed, couldn't sleep," Lucy says.  "I was thinking of what he must have been going through at the time of being chased and going to school and ending up being killed. It was just really sad for me."  There is very little research on the mental-health impact of gang violence, but a 2013 study of 108 gang members found half had an anxiety disorder, more than 85% a personality disorder and 25% screened positive for psychosis.  Prof Jeremy Coid, lead study author, said exposure to violence was the likely cause of their mental-health problems.  Lucy says gang violence affects particularly the young, black, inner-city community. For her it sparked symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  This can include flashbacks, nightmares or physical sensations such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling.  "Something could trigger off a memory. Even going past an area, someone saying something, just brings flashbacks. I've had sleep problems ever since [Zac's death] for the past five years, to the point I've had to take medication," she explains.  "I'm definitely anxious, for example, when I go to nightclubs and see people getting into an argument. Straight away I think: danger, someone has a gun, a knife. And immediately I will leave."  Her first encounter with mental-health services was when she was 14 or 15. She was given tablets and one counselling session. "Then it's like you get lost in the system."  She adds: "Then another death happens, then you feel worse so you carry on drinking, getting into more trouble. And then the killings just keep going on and in the end I just felt like I was going to have a breakdown."  Lucy says the authorities need to acknowledge that gang violence creates a lot of mental, as well as physical, trauma, and counselling should be much easier to access.  She would like to have "someone to talk to, often."  "When it's your family, it's such a hard thing to sit there and talk about. Someone giving you the time, and showing you that they're there to listen, and care what you have to say. When people feel that no-one cares, that's when people get angry and just make bad decisions," she explains.  Lucy says she is offered only tablets, and the waiting list for help is four months long.  "I just feel in that four months, anything could happen. You could end up killing yourself or being killed, especially these young men who need help, but they're too ashamed to ask for the help," she says.

The sections of bone, muscle and cartilage all functioned normally when implanted into animals.  The breakthrough, published in Nature Biotechnology, raises the hope of using living tissues to repair the body.  Experts described the technology, developed in the US, as a "goose that really does lay golden eggs".  The idea of placing individual human cells in a precise pattern to replace a damaged jaw, missing ear or scarred heart muscle holds much promise.  But the field has been limited by the huge challenge of keeping the cells alive - they become starved of oxygen and nutrients in tissues thicker than 0.2 millimetres.  The team at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre developed a new technique that 3D-prints a tissue riddled with micro-channels, rather like a sponge, to allow nutrients to penetrate the tissue.  The Integrated Tissue and Organ Printing System - or Itop - combines a bio-degradeable plastic which gives the structure and a water-based gel which contains the cells and encourages them to grow.  When the structures were implanted into animals, the plastic broke down as it was replaced by a natural, structural "matrix" of proteins produced by the cells.  Meanwhile, blood vessels and nerves grew into the implants.  Prof Anthony Atala, the lead researcher, said tissues could now be printed on a human scale.  While the implants have the same strength as human tissues, the researchers are now waiting to see how durable they are.  But Prof Atala said 3D printing was opening new doors for medicine.  He told the BBC News website: "Let's say a patient presented with an injury to their jaw bone and there's a segment missing.  "We'd bring the patient in, do the imaging and then we would take the imaging data and transfer it through our software to drive the printer to create a piece of jawbone that would fit precisely in the patient."  Similar techniques in which the biodegradable scaffolding is built first and then soaked in cells are already being used in patients.  Women were given lab-grown vaginas at the Wake Forest centre two years ago, but the range of treatments is again limited by keeping the cells alive.  Prof Atala added: "In this study we printed a wide range of tissue strengths - from muscles as a soft tissue to cartilage and bone as a hard tissue showing a whole range of tissue strengths is possible.  "The hope is to continue work on these technologies to target other humans tissues as well."  And ultimately they aim to print directly into a patient.  Prof Martin Birchall, a surgeon at University College London, said the results were "striking".  He told the BBC: "The prospect of printing human tissues and organs for implantation has been a real one for some time, but I confess I did not expect to see such rapid progress.  "They have managed to create what appears to be the goose that really does lay golden eggs!"  He cautioned there was still more research to be done before the printer could be used in patients.  But he concluded: "Given the scale of this breakthrough, progress in other fields, the resources available to the researchers at Wake Forest and the imperatives for human health, I think it will be less than a decade before surgeons like me are trialling customised printed organs and tissues. I can't wait!"	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35504768	Drivers 'exposed to highest levels of pollution'	What's the best way to avoid air pollution travelling in a city? Walking, cycling or in a vehicle?  It's a question I put a few months ago when testing some mobile pollution monitors along the busy Brompton Road in London's Knightsbridge.  The answer then was pretty categorical: being a car driver was best.  Not exactly the most environmentally friendly message - to avoid air pollution just stay in your polluting vehicle.  Environmental health experts at King's College London told me the low readings of pollution in my car were probably due to it having good air filters and were at odds with their usual findings - that pollution inside vehicles was more often worse than that outside.  The handheld monitors I used could test only for particulates - the sooty debris that is emitted from vehicle exhausts.  They could not detect nitrogen dioxide - NO2. Within cities, diesel vehicles are the main culprits for this invisible toxic gas.  For the first time NO2 can be measured while on the move - in a mobile air quality monitoring vehicle dubbed the 'smogmobile'.  Operated by UK firm Enviro Technology Services - the electric no-emissions vehicle can monitor NO2, particulates, ozone, carbon dioxide and methane.  Furthermore, it can switch every minute between measuring NO2 levels outside the vehicle, to those inside.  On a recent trip from Reading to central London, the smogmobile found levels of nitrogen dioxide were on average 21% higher inside - with the windows shut - than outside the vehicle.  I went for a drive in the smogmobile - in very heavy London traffic - from Broadcasting House, to Parliament Square and finally over the river to the South Bank.  The smogmobile is a two-seater van - with inlets on the roof, which 'sniff' the air for pollutants, and a lot of gadgetry and recording equipment in the rear.  In the front cabin there is a second NO2 inlet as well as a hand-held particulates monitor.  On our journey the levels of NO2 and particulates were roughly similar inside and out, but there were several pollution peaks within the vehicle.  One of these occurred when we were stuck behind an old-looking London tour bus.  I couldn't smell or see any pollution, but the levels of NO2 shot up, shown clearly on a tablet screen recording the levels in real time.  David Mounsor, the MD of Enviro Technology Services who was driving the smogmobile told me: "People don't realise the dangers of air pollution these days, because you can't smell it, taste it or touch it. But it is still damaging for your health."  Recent research suggests that NO2 is thought to contribute to 23,500 deaths a year in the UK, with all but five regions in the UK breaching EU safety limits.  Remarkably, parts of London breached the entire annual EU safety limit for NO2 after just eight days of January 2016.  Particulates, which can lodge in the lungs, are thought to contribute to around 29,000 deaths a year.  These figures are simply estimates, and can't simply be added together, but air quality experts believe that pollution does lead to tens of thousands of excess deaths a year in the UK.  It is worth pointing out that air quality now is vastly better than the 1950s when pea-souper smogs were common.  Smog - a mixture of smoke and fog - was responsible for thousands of deaths a week.  But reductions in air pollution have stalled. In September 2015 the government released a draft air quality strategy saying it expected eight regions of the UK - including London, Birmingham, Leeds and Southampton - to still be in breach of EU limits for NO2 by 2020.  The government's proposals for improving air quality include restrictions on diesel cars, including charging drivers for entering "clean air zones" or even banning them.  At the end my journey I visited Dr Ben Barratt, lecturer in Air Quality Science at King's College London.  He told me: "There is a growing awareness of the dangers of air pollution. As well as respiratory problems it can have effects on mental health, cardiovascular conditions and child development. So the urgency behind this issue is becoming much greater".  The UK has a network of 133 static air quality monitoring stations, whose data are modelled to estimate pollution levels across the country.  They can show trends in pollutions levels over time. But their lack of mobility means that pollution levels can be very different just a few metres from their location.  By contrast the smogmobile can reflect the pollution exposure of commuters.  David Mounsor said the smogmobile would give local authorities a "powerful tool to plan action to clean up our air and tackle one of the greatest public health challenges."  The NO2 measurements from inside the smogmobile promote green commuting with the message that if you drive your polluting car into the city, not only are you harming the environment but you maybe damaging your health.  Ben Barratt put it like this: "It's better for the environment if you leave your car at home and better for your health. It exposes you to less air pollution, you're not contributing to the problem, and you are getting the benefits of exercise."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35580758	Councils warned of penalties over political boycotts	Councils are being warned of "severe penalties" if they impose political boycotts on products from overseas.  New government guidance suggests boycotts could breach an existing World Trade Organization agreement and weaken community relationships.  Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock will make a speech later, warning that such "divisive" action can also undermine national security.  Labour said the Conservatives were attacking local democracy.  But a government source said foreign policy was a matter for national government, not local councils.  The guidance will specify that locally imposed boycotts by public bodies - including councils - are "inappropriate" unless formal legal sanctions or embargoes have been put in place by the government.  It will warn such action risks breaching a World Trade Organization agreement signed by both the EU and Israel, which requires equal treatment for suppliers from all signatory nations.  The Cabinet Office said town hall boycotts could also "undermine good community relations, poisoning and polarising debate, weakening integration and fuelling anti-Semitism", as well as hindering Britain's export trade and harming international relationships.  Mr Hancock is making the announcement in Israel, which has often been the subject of boycotts in the past.  He is expected to say the guidelines, and new rules on investing pensions funds, will "help prevent damaging and counter-productive local foreign policies undermining our national security".  A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa.  He said: "People have the right to elect local representatives able to make decisions free of central government political control. That includes withdrawal of investments or procurement on ethical and human rights grounds."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35577458	Centuries-old vellum tradition 'to be saved'	A centuries-old tradition of recording copies of Parliament's laws on calf skin will continue, a minister has said, after peers signalled its end.  Matt Hancock said the technique was "cost-effective" and the Cabinet Office would look at how to pick up the bill.  The Lords had said switching from a parchment called vellum to archival paper could save about £80,000 a year.  It said it had not received an offer from the government department and so would proceed with the original plans.  "If the Cabinet Office write offering to take on the responsibility for printing Acts of Parliament on vellum, it would of course be considered.  "As of yet, that offer has not been made," a spokesman said.  Two copies are made of Acts of Parliament. One is stored in the National Archives and the other in the Parliamentary Archives.  Significant state documents - such as Magna Carta and thousands of Acts of Parliament - have traditionally been recorded on goat or calf skin.  MPs had handed the decision to end the practice to the House of Lords, which is responsible for the cost of vellums for Parliament, and peers decided to push ahead with the cost-cutting measure.  The House of Lords said vellum was "extremely expensive" and the cost of printing copies of laws on it - which it put at £100,000 a year "cannot be justified".  "Archival quality paper is an extremely high quality and durable alternative," said chairman of committees Lord Laming.  The Commons Administration Committee backed the Lords' proposal, saying it was "convinced by the arguments".  However, it encountered criticism from MPs, with Conservative James Gray calling for the "retrograde decision" to be reversed.  Mr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph: "Recording laws on vellum is a millennium-long traditions and surprisingly cost-effective.  "While the world constantly changes, we should safeguard some of our great traditions."  In 1999, the House of Lords decided in favour of scrapping the use of vellum - but the move was rejected in the Commons by 121 votes to 53, a majority of 68.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35575457	Mental health care provision	You don't need to go further than the first paragraph in the foreword of the mental health taskforce report to find a bleak assessment of the current state of services.  People with mental health problems have been "stigmatised and marginalised", it says, and services have been "underfunded for decades".  The report, compiled by a panel of NHS and independent experts and due to be published on Monday, does acknowledge that the picture has started to change.  It points out that attitudes are improving and there is now a cross-society consensus on achieving change.  But it says the the transformation of care will take ten years - and the report marks just the beginning of the process.  The 59 recommendations of the report, all of which have been accepted by the NHS England leadership, suggest a determination to shake up all aspects of mental health care.  The aim is to have most of the implementation in place by 2020/21, but even by then the report authors admit that parity of esteem between mental and physical health will not have been achieved, though the process will be some way down the track.  The report does not always make comfortable reading for ministers in the coalition government.  A mental health strategy in 2011, says the report, was widely welcomed at the time but it did not successfully address inadequate provision and worsening outcomes.  There has been "chronic underinvestment in mental health care across the NHS in recent years".  The extent of the financial squeeze and divergence of mental and physical health budgets is underlined by findings from BBC Freedom of Information requests.  These show that the income of mental health trusts in England fell by 2% in 2014/15 after taking account of inflation.  The Health Foundation think tank says that in the same year the income of acute trusts - hospitals dealing mainly with physical health conditions - rose by 2.6% in real terms.  In the current financial year, the BBC research shows mental health trust total income is set to rise just 0.3%.  Some 29 out of 53 trusts which responded expect that by the end of the financial year their budgets will be lower than the previous year.  The Department of Health points out that local councils and other organisations also provide mental health services and these are not covered in the BBC Research.  But mental health trusts account for at least 80% of spending in this area.  Ministers and the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, will argue there will be a real annual funding increase of £1bn for mental health by 2020/21.  This will be in addition to the £280m per year already pledged to children and adolescent and perinatal services.  Even so, the £1bn is not "new" - it comes from the £8.4bn extra already awarded to NHS England for 2020/21 by Chancellor George Osborne.  Another problem identified by the report is keeping track of money spent on care of patients with mental illnesses in England.  There is said to be "little or no national data" for how much of the money is used at local level.  Mr Stevens talked of a "black box" with regard to data and has demanded more transparency.  He knows that if light is not shed in this area it will not be possible to assess progress.  The ambitions for the next few years are impressively set out, including the provision of liaison mental health services in all A&E units.  The report is honest in cataloguing the failings of the past.  But it is interesting to note that the year for delivering the targets is 2020/21 which is after the next general election.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35559629	NHS mental health funding 'falls'	Funding levels for NHS mental health care in England have fallen in recent years, the BBC has learned.  Figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request showed the budgets for mental health trusts fell by 2% from 2013/14 to 2014/15.  This compares to a rise of 2.6% in hospital trusts' operating budgets, according to analysis by the Health Foundation think-tank.  The Department of Health said mental health care funding overall was rising.  In the year to April 2016 the budget for mental health trusts was projected to rise just 0.3%.  Of the 53 out of 59 mental health trusts in England which responded to the FOI request, 29 said their budget would be lower this year than last.  The Health and Social Care Bill, which became law in the last parliament, included a demand for parity of esteem - meaning mental and physical health services should be treated equally.  But the BBC's investigation has found that for England's mental health trusts and health boards in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which provide about £12bn worth of mental health care in the UK, funding is not keeping pace - and many are facing cuts.  In Scotland, mental health spending was up just 0.1% last year, and down a projected 0.4% this year. In Wales, spending was down 1.1% in 2014-15 and up a likely 1.2% in 2015/16.  Northern Ireland was the only country to see an increase in both years, with 1% additional spending last year, and 2.6% more this year.  Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation, said: "Mental health hasn't increased as a share of NHS funding, despite the fact that there are huge demands on the system, and access to care for mental health still falls way below that for physical health.  "The NHS clearly sees parity of esteem as a key priority and want to prioritise improving mental health. But problems in our hospital sector means that money increasingly is getting sucked in to meet their rising costs, and the NHS is struggling to actually commit resources to fund mental health providers"  A Department of Health spokesman said: "These figures do not show the full picture for mental health spend - councils, third-sector organisations and NHS England all play a role in providing services, and all receive government funding.  "We have made more money available than ever before for mental health, increasing our investment every year since 2010 to a record £11.7bn last year."  It also argues community schemes like crisis cafes are on the rise, though many campaigners say these simply are not filling the gap in effective care.  The government is set to unveil its mental health taskforce report on Monday, the biggest ever study of mental health services in the England, with a five-year national strategy to improve services.  The Scottish government said extra investment in mental health had been promised.  A Welsh government spokesman said: "Spending on mental health services in Wales is rising. Indeed, we spend more on mental health services than on any other part of the Welsh NHS.  "The Welsh government has also made a significant new investment of £7.65m in child and adolescent mental health services this year - a 17% increase compared to 2013-14."  A spokesman for the Northern Ireland executive said: "In Northern Ireland...there has been increased investment in the development of psychological therapies hubs, which are locally-based groups of GPs and voluntary sector partners, who arrange for bespoke referral to and delivery of talking therapies to patients with low-to-moderate intensity mental health problems."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11483334	Obituary: Lord Avebury	Eric Lubbock, later Lord Avebury, caused one of the most sensational by-election victories in British political history when he took Orpington for the Liberals in 1962.  The poll was hailed as the beginning of a Liberal revival, and the end of the two party domination of British politics.  In the event it turned out to be no more than a freak result and Liberal hopes were, as would happen so often in the future, doomed to disappointment.  After losing his seat Lubbock continued his political career in the Lords becoming a doughty campaigner for human rights.  Eric Reginald Lubbock was born on 29 September 1928 in the Kentish village of Dene, part of the Orpington constituency, a grandson of the first Baron Avebury,  He was educated at Harrow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took an engineering degree and won a Blue for boxing.  Lubbock did his National Service in the Welsh Guards, first as a Guardsman and later as a junior officer before joining Rolls Royce where he worked as an engineer.  He became a Liberal councillor in 1960 and was selected to fight the by-election in what was seen as the safe Conservative seat of Orpington following the appointment of the sitting Conservative MP, Donald Sumner, as a High Court judge.  Lubbock had a mountain to climb. The Conservatives were sitting on a majority of nearly 15,000 and, in the 1959 general election, the Liberals had trailed in third.  But he fought a tenacious campaign highlighting the perceived shortcomings of Harold Macmillan's government. "We must not stop in our efforts to overthrow Tory blunder," he told his enthusiastic supporters.  Cracks began to appear in the Conservative campaign when their candidate Peter Goldman, who came from outside the seat, announced he had no intention of moving to live there if he became the MP.  At the same time the government announced a public-sector pay freeze that badly hit commuter areas like Orpington and impacted most severely on nurses, a move that was deemed highly unpopular.  Despite this, few political analysts predicted anything other than a Conservative win and there was general astonishment when Lubbock overturned the 1959 result - leaving the Conservatives with a deficit of nearly 7,000.  The result helped hasten the end of the Macmillan government and raised hopes within the Liberal Party that were never in fact realised.  During the next eight years, Lubbock earned a reputation in the House of Commons, not only for a conscientious devotion to the interests of his suburban constituents, but also by his tenacity in cases involving civil liberties and his grasp of technological affairs.  For good measure, he also served during most of this period as Liberal Chief Whip.  Lubbock held Orpington against fierce Conservative opposition at both the 1964 and 1966 general elections, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate in 1970.  "In 1962 the wise, far-seeing people of Orpington elected me as their Member," he said. "In 1970 the fools threw me out."  A year later he succeeded to the Avebury peerage on the death of his cousin, the third Baron; it seemed likely at first that he would renounce the title so as to contest Orpington again, but after consultation with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he decided to accept his inheritance.  Before taking his seat in the House of Lords he visited Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, on behalf of Amnesty International to report on political detentions in the island. The government of Ceylon did not encourage his inquiries and eventually expelled him.  In the Lords he continued to fight for civil liberties, often taking up immigrant cases and speaking out against racism. And, as chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, he campaigned for better treatment for prisoners in the UK and abroad.  He became part of the Liberal Democrats Foreign Affairs team in the Lords, cycling to sittings from his home in Camberwell.  Avebury was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Humanist Association and, in 2009, won a National Secular Society award for his part in the abolition of the law on Blasphemous Libel.  He also caused controversy in 2011 when he came out strongly in support of traveller families facing eviction from the Dale Farm site in Essex  In his later years he was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer and became an advocate for assisted dying.  "It is unthinkable that we should not take measures to enable people to alleviate their own suffering," he said.  A convert to Buddhism, he was passionate about recycling and once declared that he intended to leave his body to Battersea Dogs' Home. The offer was gracefully declined.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35542678	The pigeon will see you now	A rat or pigeon might not be the obvious choice to tend to someone who is sick, but these creatures have some superior skills that could help the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.  Pigeons are often seen as dirty and an urban nuisance, but they are just the latest in a long line of animals that have been found to have abilities to help humans.  Despite having a brain no bigger than the tip of your index finger, pigeons have an impressive visual memory.  Recently it was shown that they could be trained to be as accurate as humans at detecting breast cancer in images.  Here are three more of our feathered and furry friends who could have a big impact in medicine.  Rats are often associated with spreading disease rather than preventing it, but this long-tailed rodent is a highly sensitive detector that can save lives.  Inside a rodent's nose are up to 1,000 different types of olfactory receptors, whereas humans only have a feeble 100 to 200 types. This gives rodents, such as rats, the ability to sniff out subtle scents.  As a result, African-pouched rats - commonly described as "kitten-sized rodents" - are being put to work in Mozambique to detect tuberculosis.  Their abilities are being studied at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo, where trained rats can detect a specific scent produced by TB bacteria in human mucus samples.  When the rats detect the scent, they stop and rub their legs to indicate a sample is infected.  Traditionally, lab technicians prepare slides and examine each sample using microscopy. A hundred samples would take them more than two days, but for a rat it takes less than 20 minutes.  This rat detection method is affordable and doesn't rely on specialist equipment, which is often lacking in countries where TB is prevalent.  It is also more accurate - the rats are able to find more TB infections and, therefore, save more lives.  Dogs have long been considered a human's best friend - but over the years they've really proved how skilful they can be.  Recently, there has also been a focus on dogs that seem to have the extraordinary ability to detect when people with epilepsy are about to have a seizure - even when the person has no idea themselves.  Sally Burton's epilepsy began as a child and affected every aspect of her life from a young age.  "I could never be left alone," she says. "I had to be home taught and making friends or meeting new people was difficult. I often felt very lonely."  Thirteen years ago she got her first seizure alert dog, Star.  "One of the first things I did when I first had Star was to make myself a cup of tea, something I had not been able to do in 30 years because of the risks of having a seizure when holding boiling water. I then went into town on my own - again a life-time first."  It is still not known how dogs can sense a seizure. It has been suggested that minute changes in a person's gestures or posturing could alert the dog, but people have also thought that a scent or auditory cue might also be involved.  After Star passed away, Sally teamed up with her second dog Robbie. Like Star, he was trained by a British charity, Support Dogs.  The charity has shown they are able to train dogs that are able to provide signals, such as persistently nudging someone's leg, between 15 and 45 minutes before their owner had a seizure.  Although there is still little other published evidence to back up their effectiveness, the anecdotal evidence for seizure dogs like Robbie is strong.  "When I am out it is reassuring to know that Robbie will give me a 100% reliable 50-minute warning prior to every oncoming seizure I have - so plenty of time to get somewhere safe," Sally says.  Drool, dribble, or spit. Whatever you call it, saliva can be thought of as disgusting. But many animals lick their wounds, applying liberal amounts of the stuff to try and prevent infection.  Saliva across the animal kingdom can have antimicrobial properties - including saliva from the humble cow.  Studies have shown that there are proteins in a cow's bodily fluids, including its saliva and milk, that have bug-fighting properties.  Salvia also contains proteins - called mucins - that can work to prevent further bacteria entering the wound.  Experts don't recommend letting an animal lick your wounds as they could introduce other bacteria, but if you don't fancy that then, luckily, your own spit also contains antibacterial properties.	health

Unison's Christina McAnea said imposing the contract "sends a very worrying message to other members of staff".  "Everybody else is really worried that if they can do this to doctors, what does that mean for us?" said Ms McAnea.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the contract will improve patient care.  He has criticised the British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, for failing to reach a deal over the past three years and said the contract is an "important step" in improving care at weekends.  Ms McAnea told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Our feeling is the government wants to extend seven-day services but they don't want to fund it.  "They want staff to fund it through accepting cuts to pay and conditions."  Asked if she thought more strikes were likely from other categories of NHS staff if contracts were imposed on them, she said: "Yes, if there is a cut to unsocial hours payments or an imposition [of a new contract] then I think they would look to take some kind of action."  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  A petition on a government website calling for a vote of no confidence in Mr Hunt has gained more than 180,000 signatures - above the 100,000 threshold for a Commons debate to be considered.  The office of the Conservatives in Fareham said it had cancelled a public event with the health secretary on Friday evening "on security grounds" after critics of the government's reforms began circulating details of the reception online.  A smaller private event went ahead at a different venue.  Paul Brooks, who runs an agency placing doctors in jobs abroad, told the BBC he had seen only "a few" more enquiries from junior doctors.  "Most, though, do not seem to be wanting to go overseas yet, as juniors. It's the doctors who have got their specialisation who are looking to move overseas - GPs or A&E doctors," said Mr Brooks.  "In the traditional places like Australia and New Zealand, there are many fewer jobs now than there were. They've trained quite a lot of their own doctors - there are already more doctors in Australia per head of population than we have here by quite a significant number.  "And I just don't think the opportunities are there for doctors without a specialisation."  However, he said the opportunities for GPs in Australia were "definitely better".  "It's fairly clear cut that they're getting a better quality of life," he said.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35563301	Was a deal over doctors' contracts ever possible?	On Tuesday, the eve of this week's strike by junior doctors in England, the government's negotiating team made a last ditch attempt to break the deadlock with the British Medical Association.  Sir David Dalton, the highly respected boss of Salford Royal Hospital, who was brought in last month by ministers to try to arrange a deal, was accompanied by NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer and Clare Panniker, the chief executive of Basildon and Thurrock NHS Trust.  They met the British Medical Association (BMA) leadership at their London headquarters.  Afterwards they left and put together a final "take it or leave it" offer which they, and ministers, hoped would win the doctors round.  It didn't. Almost exactly 24 hours later with the strike in full swing the BMA responded by letter, turning the offer down.  The following day, Thursday, the government took the step that the wider health service had been dreading: imposition.  The move looks as if it will spark a long and bitter dispute between ministers and the medical profession.  More strikes could be called. Doctors are threatening to walk away from the NHS in England.  But just how close did the sides get to an agreement?  The BMA had been adamant all along that Saturdays should not be classed as a normal working day.  They wanted any doctor working on a Saturday to get 50% extra above basic pay.  But ministers - who are keen to rota more doctors on at weekends - were clear that wasn't affordable.  In November they proposed that extra pay should only be available from 10pm.  That was then brought forward to 7pm before 5pm was proposed. There was no further change on that this week.  But recognising that this was a totemic issue, the negotiators did convince ministers to agree to a more generous deal for doctors who work regular Saturdays.  Instead of those who work at least one in three getting extra - which was the offer on the table ahead of this week - the negotiators offered to pay 30% more to those who worked at least one in four.  This was to be paid for all the Saturdays worked.  That would have meant over half the workforce would have ended up on higher pay - albeit at a rate that was less than the 50% extra the BMA was after.  It applies to 55,000 junior doctors working across a range of specialities at a variety of different grades.  There were lots of other areas where agreement had not quite been reached, such as payments for interrupted breaks, on-call allowances, safeguards on excessive hours and what exactly constitutes a night shift - to name just four.  But it's easy to look at these details and conclude the two sides were pretty close.  They weren't - and to work out why you need to look at the wider picture.  To say junior doctors are suspicious of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to state the obvious.  This week the BMA was using terms like "attacked" and "patronised". Perhaps with some justification.  There are plenty of people within the health service not associated with the BMA who privately acknowledge the health secretary could have gone about this much better.  There is also a belief among doctors that this contract is part of a wider desire to erode the terms and conditions of the entire NHS workforce to make it cheaper to increase staffing at weekends.  To, in effect, squeeze more and more from a workforce that believes it gives plenty.  And while the government has made much of its claims that some doctors will be better off, a significant number - perhaps as many as one in four - would lose out if it wasn't for the government pledge to top up their pay for three years.  In short, the profession believes if staffing is to be increased at weekends it needs to be accompanied by an increase in investment.  But ministers are trying to do this for the same money. The sums simply don't add up, doctors say.  Equally the government's side is exasperated with the BMA.  Both the health secretary and Sir David Dalton have publicly claimed the union was unwilling to compromise.  One theory is it couldn't. That is to say, the membership were so adamant that they should not give an inch that the BMA leadership felt unable to do a deal.  While on paper the two sides may not seem a million miles apart, perhaps an agreement has been out of reach for some time.	health

It has also seen an alarming number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome - which can cause devastating paralysis. Scientists are cautious of making a direct connection between the two, but on the frontline the panic is real - and growing.  Imagine losing control over the muscles in your body. It starts with pins and needles in your feet. You lose feeling in your legs. Then you can't even blink. Victims of Guillain-Barre can sometimes show the whites of their eyes, as if they are the living dead. And, in the worst cases, it can mean you can no longer breathe.  Fabian Medina, 22, should be in the prime of his life but he has the vitality of a man of 90. He's recovering from the paralysis after two weeks in intensive care.  If he hadn't been on ventilation, he would be dead. When I ask Fabian if he has children, he struggles to lift up one finger. Then, with a curling gesture, he describes the roundness of a pregnant woman's belly and starts to weep.  His wife Karen, three months pregnant, has had Zika, the symptoms were mild, the consequence yet to be known. "My fear," she explains, "is that on the news they say your baby can be deformed. I am really frightened and pray to God that nothing bad will happen to it.'  What might be seen when a baby is born is causing great anxiety in South America: terrifying birth deformities where babies are born missing the front part of their brains, known as microcephaly.  The prime suspect for the birth deformities is the Zika virus - originally from Africa, now plaguing South America. Zika, carried by the Aedes Egypti mosquito, is suspected of causing 400 confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil. Many doctors in Colombia believe that Zika is also causing the paralysis.  Others are sceptical about linking Zika with Guillain-Barre syndrome. WHO spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, said: "We must really be cautious and not mix the two too much," as the link has not yet been proven by experts.  Here in Cucuta on the frontline it's taken for granted.  No doubting that Zika is moving north. The outbreak of the creeping paralysis in Colombia started in October but it won't be until June that it will be known if there will be an increase in babies born with microcephaly. In Cucuta and the surrounding area, there are 27 cases of paralysis and 27,000 cases of Zika across the whole of Colombia.  For the moment, there is no treatment and no vaccine. The only way of not contracting the disease is prevention, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers and dousing yourself with mosquito repellent.  Terrified of catching Zika, I ended up smelling like a chemical factory and, with my trousers tucked into my socks, looked like Tintin. The contrast with the locals was comic. Everybody dresses as if they are at the beach. In the tropical heat, that makes sense. With Zika, it doesn't.  The disease was first identified in Uganda in 1947 but traditionally Zika was seen as a mild viral fever. It was then seen in South East Asia and the Pacific Islands. Now it is in South America, and there multiple reports of paralysis and birth defects.  Dr Marco Fonseca is a neuro-surgeon in Cucuta. "It looks like the virus changed in some way," he told me. "I'm afraid there is some change in the genome. This is Zika-plus. A mutation."  Dr Fonseca doesn't rule out environmental factors and is waiting for the definitive answer from the biologists and the epidemiologists.  Other scientists are considering the possibility that Zika is behaving the same as it has in the past, but that the consequences are different because it is in densely-populated areas.  Dr Fonseca suspects that the spread of the disease was fuelled by the football World Cup in 2014. Will the Brazil Olympics hasten it further, to California, to southern Europe? He said: "It's going to go to California. With the Olympics it will go a little faster."  The Colombian authorities are trying hard to raise awareness of the dangers from Zika. Next door to a school in Cucuta, a public health official found buckets of water full of wriggling mosquito larvae.

In experiments on worms, University of Cambridge researchers identified drugs which prevented the very first step towards brain cell death.  They now want to match up drugs with specific stages of the disease.  Experts said it was important to find out if these drugs could work safely in humans.  Statins are taken by people to reduce the risk of developing heart disease and the Cambridge research team says their work may have unearthed a potential "neurostatin" to ward off Alzheimer's disease.  Rather than treating the symptoms of the disease, a neurostatin could be used as a preventative measure to stop the condition appearing in the first place.  The cancer drug bexarotene, for example, was found to stop the first step which leads to the death of brain cells in worms genetically programmed to develop Alzheimer's disease.  In previous trials in humans, researchers tested the drug at a later stage of the disease to see if it would clear amyloid plaques from the brain but the trials were unsuccessful.  Dr Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said scientists must find out exactly how the drug works before any clinical trials.  "We will now need to see whether this new preventative approach could halt the earliest biological events in Alzheimer's and keep damage at bay in further animal and human studies.  "This early research in worms suggests that bexarotene could act earlier in the process to interfere with amyloid build-up."  Writing in Science Advances, Prof Michele Vendruscolo, senior study author from the University of Cambridge, said the research team wanted to find out more about the mechanics of every stage of the disease's development.  "The body has a variety of natural defences to protect itself against neurodegeneration, but as we age, these defences become progressively impaired and can get overwhelmed.  "By understanding how these natural defences work, we might be able to support them by designing drugs that behave in similar ways."  Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society, said it was still early days.  "Bexarotene has many side-effects when used to treat lymphoma, such as skin complaints, headaches, and sickness, and we would also need to be sure that it's safe for people with Alzheimer's to take.  "We haven't found any new drugs for dementia in over 10 years, and repurposing drugs that already work for other conditions could provide us with a shortcut to new dementia treatments."	health

The move follows claims by Channel 4 News that some bills were not included in local spending returns during the poll and two other by-elections.  Labour's defeated candidate in the Newark poll, which the Conservatives won, has called for an investigation.  The Conservatives say all spending was recorded in accordance with the law.  Earlier this week, Channel 4 News said it had obtained hotel bills which suggested the party broke electoral rules in the Newark, Clacton and Rochester & Strood by-elections, the first of which the Conservatives won and the other two it lost to UKIP.  Conservative MP Robert Jenrick, who won the Newark contest, told BBC News he was "very confident" his election expenses were compiled "in complete compliance with the law".  "The allegations that were on Channel 4 News are, as far as I can see, completely unfounded," he added.  Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.  But Channel 4 News' political correspondent Michael Crick said he had uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.  The programme found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.  Michael Payne, who represented Labour in the Newark by-election, wrote to Nottinghamshire Police on Tuesday asking it to look into claims of "undeclared" spending by his rivals, saying he wanted reassurance that electoral laws and procedures had been complied with.  Nottinghamshire Police confirmed it had received an e-mail on the issue, adding: "This is the first communication we have received. The force will review the content of the communication, but we should make it clear that no investigation has been launched at this time."  The BBC understands that detectives in the Fraud and Financial Crimes Unit at Nottinghamshire Constabulary are handling the case.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose party came second in Newark, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.  A Conservative spokeswoman, speaking on Wednesday, said: "All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35561719	Zika and microcephaly link confirmed "in weeks" says WHO	The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to decide within a few weeks if there is a link between the Zika virus and birth defects.  Around 4,000 cases of microcephaly - babies with underdeveloped brains - have been reported in Brazil alone.  A link with Zika has been strongly suspected for some time, but this has not been supported by rigorous scientific studies.  The WHO says large trials of Zika vaccines will take at least 18 months.  Since the first cases of Zika crept up on South America in May last year, there have been far more questions then answers.  The biggest: Is the very mild Zika virus in fact causing devastating microcephaly in the babies of infected mothers?  "It seems indeed that the link with Zika (and microcephaly) is becoming more and more probable" said Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general of the WHO.  "I think that we need a few more weeks and a few more studies to have this straight," she said.  While there have been a few cases where fragments of the Zika virus have been found in amniotic fluid and the tissue of foetuses and babies who died soon after delivery, there have not yet been any results from controlled scientific studies.  Many are now underway, and the first is due to report back in the coming weeks.  A group of pregnant women who have tested positive for Zika in Colombia are being closely monitored.  When they start giving birth and providing information about the health of their babies, scientists will able to draw some much needed conclusions.  The WHO is also expecting evidence to confirm a link between Zika and the rare nerve disorder Guillain-Barre, which can cause paralysis and, in extreme cases, be fatal.  The UN agency said a vaccine for Zika will take at least 18 months to produce.  The two most promising possibilities at the moment are being developed by the US National Institutes of Health and the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech.  But new diagnostic kits could be available "in weeks not years", according to the WHO.  It also said efforts are currently focused on finding drugs which stop people becoming infected in the first place, rather than on cures.  But as the race continues to find answers and new tools to fight Zika, it may actually end up being people's own natural defences that stop the potentially devastating effects of the virus.  In previous outbreaks of similar viruses such as chikungunya, the WHO says there has been a wave of new cases when a new virus enters a population, but then people build up their own immunity to it and new cases peter out.  "We don't know if this will be the case with Zika," said Marie-Paule Kieny.  "We have to see how this develops and how easy it will be to test new vaccines when they are ready. It depends how much of the disease is still in communities at that moment."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35558349	Tribunal rules computer hacking by GCHQ is not illegal	GCHQ is operating within the law when it hacks into computers and smart phones, a security tribunal has ruled.  Campaigners Privacy International have lost a legal challenge claiming the spying post's hacking operations are too intrusive and break European law.  The case was launched after revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of US and UK spying.  GCHQ admitted its agents hack devices, in the UK and abroad, for the first time during the hearings.  Its previous policy had been to "neither confirm nor deny" the existence of such operations.  Hackers can remotely activate cameras and microphones on devices, without the owner's knowledge, log keystrokes, install malware, copy documents and track locations among other things, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) was told.  The Home Office has now published a code of practice for hacking, or "equipment interference" as it is also known, and aims to put it on a firmer legal footing in its Investigatory Powers Bill, which is due to become law later this year.  The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a panel of senior judges, said in its ruling that the code struck the right balance between the "urgent need of the Intelligence Agencies to safeguard the public and the protection of an individual's privacy and/or freedom of expression".  But the judges were "satisfied" the agency was already operating in a lawful and proportionate way, whatever the outcome of Parliament's scrutiny of the Investigatory Powers Bill.  Privacy International, which launched the legal challenge with seven internet service providers, said it was "disappointed" by the ruling and would continue to challenge "state-sponsored hacking," which it said was "incompatible with democratic principles and human rights standards".  Scarlet Kim, Privacy International's legal officer, said: "Hacking is one of the most intrusive surveillance capabilities available to intelligence agencies.  "This case exposed not only these secret practices but also the undemocratic manner in which the government sought to backdate powers to do this under the radar.  "Just because the government magically produces guidelines for hacking should not legitimise this practice."  She added that hacking "fundamentally weakens the security of computers and the internet" by exploiting the "weaknesses in software and hardware used by millions of people".  "It is akin to unlocking a person's window without their knowledge and leaving it open for any attacker - whether GCHQ, another country's intelligence agency or a cyber criminal - to access."  "The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public," he said.  "Once again, the law and practice around our Security and Intelligence Agencies' capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.  "The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will further strengthen the safeguards for the Agencies' use of these powers, including a new double-lock authorisation process.  "It will provide our Security and Intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats our country faces, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35559447	A guide to devolution in the UK	There have long been important distinctions in the way different parts of the UK work - for example, the separate education and legal systems in Scotland. But in 1997, devolution - the transfer of some powers from central to regional bases - entered a new phase.  That year, referendums were held in Scotland and Wales, with both parts of Ireland following in 1998.  These resulted in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Another major shake-up came in the form of the 2014 Scottish referendum. Although voters said "No" to full independence for Scotland, the period leading up to the vote led to an intense debate over what Scotland should be able to decide for itself.  The debate has already resulted in more powers being offered to the Scottish Parliament - and is likely to influence how the process of devolution continues, not just in Scotland, but across the UK.  Indeed, since its election in May 2015, the Conservative government has brought forward measures to devolve more powers away from Westminster. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are to receive extra powers, and a number of "city regions", notably Greater Manchester have been granted extra control over some local spending and decisions.  The table below gives an overview of the main powers given to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, and the Scottish Parliament. The UK government's proposals for the devolution of further powers to each constituent nation are discussed further below.  * Scotland has always had its own legal system  The UK government, led by the prime minister in Downing Street, is responsible for national policy on all powers which have not been devolved - known usually as "reserved powers".  The main areas which are reserved to Westminster are:  The Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh and is made up of 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), who scrutinise and pass bills in various areas of its many devolved responsibilities.  In addition to the main devolved powers, the Parliament can legislate on planning, natural and built heritage, sport and the arts, statistics, public registers and records.  But Holyrood will soon get control over more areas of Scottish life.  In the wake of the "No" vote in the Scottish independence referendum, all parties participated in the Smith Commission, a body which undertook to look at the devolution of further powers. Its recommendations form the basis of the 2015 Scotland Bill currently making its way through the UK parliament at Westminster. If agreed to, the Scottish Parliament will be granted powers over and around:  The SNP, which currently controls the Scottish government at Holyrood, says the proposals fall short of the mark and it continues to argue for full independence.  With polls suggesting that Nicola Sturgeon's party will again form a majority government at the forthcoming Scottish Parliament elections, the powers held by Edinburgh and Scotland's place in the Union will likely continue to be the matter of considerable debate.  The National Assembly for Wales sits at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Assembly Members (AMs). The Welsh government is its executive branch.  Since 2011 the Welsh assembly has had primary law-making powers over devolved areas, and in 2014 it gained tax-raising powers including stamp duty and landfill tax.  Arrangements are also in place for some powers over income tax; these were originally to be subject to approval in a referendum. This requirement has now been removed.  In addition, the assembly can make laws relating to ancient monuments and historic buildings, public administration, sport and recreation, tourism, town and country planning, flood defences, the assembly itself, and the Welsh language.  The government is currently consulting on a draft bill that would put devolution in Wales on a similar model to that in Scotland. Whereas powers are currently "conferred" on the Welsh Assembly, the UK government wants to move to a "reserved powers framework" whereby everything is devolved to Cardiff unless specifically stated otherwise. The bill also proposes the devolution of some transport and election powers.  The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast, and is made up of 108 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).  The power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is critical to the functioning of the assembly; devolution of powers has been suspended and reinstated several times since it started in 1998.  Devolution here is slightly different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: transferred, reserved and excepted.  In addition to the main devolved powers, the assembly can also legislate on culture, arts and leisure, learning and employment and regional and social development.  In March 2010, an agreement was passed to transfer powers of justice and policing to Northern Ireland.  As devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has gathered pace, many people have argued that England's regions are being left behind.  There are two particular sources of tension.  The Treasury gives block grants to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to spend on devolved policy areas, calculated through the Barnett formula on the basis of population size.  Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs' can vote on laws that only apply in England - which some people believe should be addressed through English votes on English laws, the idea that only English MPs should be able to vote on laws which predominantly affect England.  The Barnett formula is set to be revised as Scotland gets more tax-raising powers, but it is not clear whether there will be any similar reconsideration of the way it funds Wales and Northern Ireland.  To deal with "English votes for English laws" the government has come up with a complicated set of arrangements which MPs are currently trying on a trial basis.  A new stage has been added to the parliamentary process whereby consent is needed not just from the Commons as a whole, but also from MPs who sit for the relevant part of the UK. For example, English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.  On top of that, government plans are afoot for devolution to England's cities and regions, including through the introduction of elected mayors and "city regions".	politics

The Press Association has published details of expenditure from Mr Bercow's official House account, obtained under Freedom of Information rules.  It includes £1,023 for beeswax candles and £286 to tune a grand piano.  The Speaker's office said spending was 19% lower than under his predecessor.  Mr Bercow has been Speaker since 2009, when he replaced Michael Martin - who stepped down amid the Commons expenses scandal.  He is not subject to such stringent rules on expenses as other MPs, whose claims for food and drink are capped. MPs travelling outside their constituency on parliamentary business can claim £25 a day on food and drink, excluding alcohol.  According to the Press Association, Mr Bercow spent £2,223.34 on a dinner for the "panel of chairs" - a group of MPs who chair public bill committees - in January 2010. In 2015, he spent £2,057 on a dinner to mark the retirement of former Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.  Up to £7,400 has been charged to the taxpayer, since 2012, on annual receptions for members of Parliament following the State Opening of Parliament while £3,000 was spent on a reception for new MPs in July 2015.  Spending on functions for foreign parliamentarians are also recorded in the figures. A lunch for the Romanian Speaker in December 2012 cost £1,521.37 while a similar event for the Slovenian Speaker a year later cost £1,444.74.  A dinner in honour of the Australian Speaker in May 2014 cost £1,954.38.  Other miscellaneous items of spending included £286 on tuning the grand piano in Speaker's House which is "available for members to use upon request". Official postcard-size portrait photographs of the Speaker and senior officials taken at the State Opening of Parliament, which are available "on request", cost £307 to produce in November 2014 and £210 in December 2012.  An order for "hand-finished" beeswax candles was made in July 2012, to be used for official gatherings in the State Rooms.  A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said they were not querying the figures but defended the outlay, saying every Speaker in modern times has hosted receptions for MPs after the State Opening and the cost of doing so had fallen by 77% since 2009.  She said it was "long-established practice" for the Speaker to pay for drinks ahead of the panel of chairs' annual dinner, which he did not routinely attend, while the Speaker was traditionally expected to host occasions for foreign dignitaries and to mark the departure of retiring and new MPs.  She said the Speaker was committed to cutting costs wherever possible and total spending by the Speaker's Office had fallen from £626,029 in 2009-10, the year in which he was elected, to £504,737 in 2014-15.  "These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure including, among other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office," she said.  The Press Association said the Commons was unable to supply any information prior to April 2012 since it had been "destroyed in accordance with the parliamentary records disposal policy".  Pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance said no-one "begrudged" the Speaker for footing the bill for official functions he was responsible for hosting and it was encouraging that overall spending by his office had fallen.  But it said all spending by the Speaker's office should be made public as a matter of course so it could be subject to "proper scrutiny".  Details of Mr Bercow's travel expenses are published every year. Between April 2014 and April 2015, he claimed more than £31,000 in travel and accommodation expenses, figure published last July showed.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35371246	What is mental health?	Everyone has mental health. It involves our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and it affects how we think, feel, and act.  It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.  One in four adults in the UK are likely to have a mental health problem at some stage in their lifetime, experts believe.  The overall number of people with mental health problems has not changed significantly in recent years, according to the mental health charity Mind.  In Europe, it is estimated that 83 million people experience a mental health condition every year.  According to statistics from the Royal College of Psychiatrists:  Mental health problems are defined and classified to help experts refer people for the right care and treatment. The symptoms are grouped in two broad categories - neurotic and psychotic.  Neurotic conditions are extreme forms of "normal" emotional experiences such as depression, anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  Psychotic symptoms affect around one in 100 and these interfere with a person's perception of reality, impairing their thoughts and judgments. Conditions include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  The exact cause of most mental illnesses is not known but a combination of physical, psychological and environmental factors are thought to play a role.  Many mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder can run in families, which suggests a genetic link.  Experts believe many mental illnesses are linked to abnormalities in several genes that predispose people to problems, but don't on their own directly cause them. So a person can inherit a susceptibility to a condition but may not go on to develop it.  Difficult life events can then trigger a mental illness in a person who is susceptible.  According to the charity Mind the following factors could potentially trigger a period of poor mental health:  Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health disorders in the UK, experts have recorded.  In the annual health survey for England, depression was the most frequently reported mental illness, with nearly one in five (19%) people saying they had been diagnosed with the condition.  Official data collected by the Health and Social Care Information Centre categorises common mental health disorders as phobias, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, post-natal depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.  Conversely, serious disorders are illnesses such as bipolar disorder, eating disorders, nervous breakdowns, personality disorders, psychosis and schizophrenia.  A mental illness can not be tested by checking blood or body fluids. Instead it is diagnosed, usually by an experienced psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, after studying a patient's symptoms and monitoring them over a period of time.  Many different mental illnesses can have overlapping symptoms, so it can be difficult to tell the conditions apart.  To diagnose a mental health condition, psychiatrists in the UK may refer to the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system. This lists known mental health problems and their symptoms under various sub-categories. It is updated around every 15 years.  For common problems such as depression and anxiety, your GP may be able to give you a diagnosis after one or two appointments.  Find out if you should be seeking help by answering a few short questions.  If you are having trouble understanding any of these questions, or at any point you start to feel distressed, please stop and seek the advice of a medical professional. See the links at the foot of this page for organisations that may be able to help you.  The first eight questions are taken from a measure known as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 or PHQ-9, used by doctors to assess and monitor depression severity. The PHQ-9 was developed by Dr Robert L Spitzer, Dr Janet B W Williams, Dr Kurt Kroenke and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc.  The two most common forms of treatment offered through the NHS are either talking treatments or medication.  Talking therapy involves talking about problems with a trained professional. These problems are usually linked to your mental and emotional health.  A technique known as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely available on the NHS. CBT focuses on the "here and now". CBT looks at how 'automatic' thoughts can affect how you feel, and aims to change these.  Psychotherapy is another type of talking therapy, and it typically focuses on your early relationships and experiences and how they impact on current relationships.  In terms of medication the four main groups of pills include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and mood stabilisers.  Antidepressants are usually prescribed for anxiety and depression as are benzodiazepines.  Meanwhile, antipsychotics affect a number of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters - according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists these are chemicals which brain cells need to communicate with each other. Dopamine is the main neurotransmitter affected by these medications.  Recommended treatments for different conditions usually follow official clinical guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35543194	Snowballs, handstands and famous sons	It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.  The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible.  This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.  The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead.  So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.  Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice.  "Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."  Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been "beastly to him" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was "spoil him rotten".  Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons.  His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.  Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice.  The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit "in a bespectacled eye" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days.  The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect.  Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.  At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.  MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500.  Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them.  It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands.  Randolph was heard to say: "I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35557135	Junior doctors' row: NHS chiefs speak out over letter	Some NHS bosses have distanced themselves from suggestions they backed a new junior doctors contract being imposed, after their names were linked to a letter used to justify the move.  Names of 20 chief executives appeared on a letter from the government's chief negotiator, advising it to do "whatever it deems necessary" to end the row.  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a contact would be imposed.  But ten of the letter's signatories say they do not support the decision.  Ministers took the decision to impose the contract in England after their mediator Sir David Dalton advised them a negotiated outcome "no longer seems possible".  In his letter to Mr Hunt, Sir David said the recommendation "to make sure that a new contract is in place" was supported by "chief executives across the country", and supplied 20 names.  Analysis: Where now for junior doctors' dispute?  Some half of the signatories have since stressed that they did not agree to the contract being forced on medics.  Sir Andrew Cash, head of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said he supported "the improved offer made this week as fair and reasonable", but said: "I do not support imposition."  Meanwhile, Andrew Foster, of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, said: "I have not supported contract imposition. I have supported the view that the offer made is reasonable."  Responding, Sir David told the Health Service Journal (HSJ) the statement they had agreed to "was confirming that the best and final position was considered fair and reasonable, and that they believed the NHS needed certainty and not continuation of the stalemate".  He continued that if anyone wanted to make an inference from this that they supported imposition, "then that is their inference, [but] that is not what [the signatories] have committed their names to".  "I neither want to say they do or that they don't. There is a variety of opinion on this."  The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym said the debate over whether there was wider support among NHS leaders for the government's stance could turn out "to be a storm in a teacup".  But he said it was an "unfortunate development as ministers embarked upon what may prove to be a long-haul task of finalising and pushing through the contract".  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  Junior doctor leaders have promised to fight on after the government in England announced it would impose a new contract on the profession.  It comes after junior doctors staged a second 24-hour strike over the controversial new contract.  The British Medical Association's junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said it was "flawed" and they had put forward a "fair and affordable" alternative.  Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Hunt said the contract was an "important step" in improving care at weekends.  He said the government's door had "remained open for three years" but the BMA had proved "unwilling" to show flexibility and compromise.  In theory, it is pretty easy.  Junior doctors rotate through jobs quickly so within a year of the new contract coming into force in August the majority of the 55,000-strong workforce would be on it. All new doctors graduating from medical school will also go on it.  There are some who are on longer contracts, who will not go on it straight away, while others will have completed their training before it affects them. This group represents about a fifth of the workforce, it is thought.  Between now and the summer hospitals will have to review their rotas and staffing requirements, before sending out offers to junior doctors in May.  But the big unknown is how the British Medical Association and medical workforce will react.  While in the long-term doctors have warned of "brain-drain" with medics heading abroad, to other parts of the UK or into other sectors, such as the drugs industry. This, it seems, is uncharted territory - imposing a whole new contract on doctors like this has never been done before it is believed.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35555935	Junior doctors' dispute	After weeks of uncertainty - and both sides eyeing each other suspiciously from a distance - the junior doctors' row has moved to a new level this week.  Events have moved fast. An afternoon of talks, a new offer, a strike, and a deadline - which passed followed by the dramatic planned imposition of a new contract.  Then came a row over whether there was wider support among NHS leaders over the government's stance.  So where next?  Government negotiators felt they had made a significant move late on Tuesday with a new offer to the British Medical Association. This would have extended the proposed premium payment for Saturday working from doctors doing one weekend in three to one in four.  But the BMA argued it did not cover the other 50% or so of doctors who did fewer weekends, and so would not qualify for extra payments for working on a Saturday before 17:00.  Wednesday's strike, affecting routine and non-urgent care at English hospitals, continued with no word of the offer or a BMA response.  Late in the evening, details emerged with the important revelation that the government's chief negotiator, Sir David Dalton, had given the BMA a deadline, which had passed.  The union's failure to back the offer, Sir David argued, represented the end of the road for negotiations.  The logical consequence of Sir David's statement was that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt would feel able to impose a new contract on junior doctors.  There was speculation on whether that might happen within days. In the event it happened with hours of the strike ending at 08:00 on Thursday morning.  Sir David's involvement has been very important for the health secretary.  Mr Hunt has been able to argue that a respected hospital chief executive (Sir David runs Salford Royal Foundation Trust) has done all he possibly could to reach a settlement and that his impartial judgement on ending the talks should be respected.  Sure enough, Mr Hunt could quote Sir David's advice in the House of Commons as he announced his plan to impose the contract from August.  Sir David's letter advised the government to "do whatever it deemed necessary to end uncertainty for the service and to make sure that a new contract is in place".  He said this position was supported by trust chief executives across the country and twenty of their names were added to the letter.  The involvement of a wider group of NHS leaders gave the government further comfort as ministers embarked on their controversial imposition plan.  But late on Thursday, this began to look fragile as the Health Service Journal discovered that some of the 20 named in the letter did not actually support the imposing of the contract.  A bizarre series of exchanges on Twitter flushed out more chief executives distancing themselves from the government's policy - bringing the total to 10 out of 20 according to HSJ.  One of them, Andrew Foster, of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust, even suggested he had supported a different letter to the one published.  Sir David later told the journal the statement the signatories agreed to was confirming the final position was fair and reasonable, and not signifying support for imposition of the contract.  The Department of Health said this was not a matter for them but for NHS Employers.  It all might prove to be a storm in a teacup with the Dalton letter and its supporters forgotten in a week's time.  But it is an unfortunate development as the government embarks upon what may prove a long-haul in their task of finalising and pushing through the contract.  Ministers certainly will not want to see support at senior levels in NHS management melt away as they move into uncharted waters with contract imposition.  A noisy gathering of junior doctors at Westminster on Thursday night showed that they were not winding down their campaign against the contract.  The BMA is planning its next move, which might involve further industrial action.  It may be a long, hot summer for the government as it tries to win public support for a move that has angered an important constituency in the medical profession.	health

Mr Benn highlighted global political dangers as he insisted the case for staying in is "stronger than ever".  But Vote Leave, one of the groups campaigning for an exit, accused him of resorting to scare tactics.  It comes as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK still has "issues" with a proposed EU reform package.  "There is no deal at present; there is a working draft," he said.  "We have issues, some of which have been addressed - language issues - in the latest iteration of the draft, some of which have not been addressed," Mr Hammond told reporters in Brussels.  "So the discussions continue and I do not think it is sensible to draw any conclusions about the shape of the deal until we see the final text that emerges from the European Council meeting," he added.  David Cameron is hoping to secure a deal on the proposed reforms at the EC meeting in Brussels next week, paving the way for a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU in June.  Delivering a speech at the Chatham House think-tank in London, Hilary Benn said leaving the European Union would mean the UK was less able to deal with international challenges such as the migrant crisis and climate change.  Referring to Russian action in the Crimea and Ukraine, Mr Benn said it was down to "Europe's collective response that we have been able to exert real pressure and have an impact".  "Efforts towards the creation of an EU-wide energy union will, over time, weaken Russia's dominance as an energy supplier in Europe," he added.  "Let's be clear. President Putin would shed no tears if Britain left the European Union. He would see Brexit as a sign of our weakness and of the weakness of European solidarity at the very moment when we need to maintain our collective strength."  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, hit back at Mr Benn's claims.  "Pro-EU campaigners cannot make a positive case for remaining in a political project that is incapable of dealing with the challenges of the 21st century," he said.  "Instead of accepting that we need a new relationship with the EU, they are whipping up fear about dictators and economic doom despite the fact that neither are remotely credible.  "Voting Leave is the safe option as it will allow us to make our own trade deals, end the supremacy of EU law and invest in our priorities."  Mr Benn also used his speech to restate his position on the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons, which are at odds with those of his party's leader Jeremy Corbyn.  He said other nuclear powers would not throw their missiles "in the dustbin" if the UK unilaterally disarmed.  "I think you get there by multilateral negotiation and not by unilateral action," he said.  "If we gave ours up I don't believe for a second that any one of the other nuclear powers in the world would say 'well if you're not going to keep yours any more we'll throw ours in the dustbin'."  Labour is carrying out a review of its defence policy, including whether Trident should be renewed.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35553408	Analysis: What MPs say is wrong with spy bill	Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated.  The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.  The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.  The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing.  But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page).  Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says.  Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication).  However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged.  Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern.  Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.  Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive.  It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.  There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).  A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions.  The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take "practicable" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems.  Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.  The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence.  On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information.  The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on "codes of practice" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.  The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line.  It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer.  The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.  There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush.  One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate.  The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year.	politics

It will also authorise the bulk collection of personal data and hacking of smartphones by Britain's spies.  Ministers say the changes will help to catch terrorists and tackle organised crime by updating laws to fit the new technology being used by criminals.  But civil liberties campaigners claim the measures contained in it amount to mass surveillance of UK citizens - and that the committee's report meant the home secretary needed to go "back to the drawing board".  Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: "This report shows just how much homework the government has to do on this landmark legislation."  Labour's shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has written to Mrs May to say that while Labour supports the overall aim of the bill - to give police and security services the powers they need - the government must now take time to reconsider its plans to ensure they strike "the right balance for our security and privacy".  Mrs May said the government would "carefully consider" the conclusions of three committees which have reported on the Bill before presenting its final proposals.  "This is vital legislation, and we are absolutely determined to get it right.  "Our draft Bill followed three independent reports on investigatory powers, whose authors were unanimous a new law was necessary.  "We are clear we need to introduce legislation which responds to the threats we face in the digital age, protects both the privacy and security of the public, and provides world-leading oversight and safeguards."  Communications firms - such as your broadband or mobile phone providers - will be compelled to hold a year's worth of your communications data.  In simple terms, police say they want to be able to get at these records, going back a year, so that if they get a lead on a suspect, they can establish more about their network or conspiracy.  Under existing law, agencies can already ask firms to start collecting this data - but they can't access historic information because companies don't keep it. Police argue that this means many investigations into crime with an online element go cold because they can't link activity to specific people or devices.  The Joint Committee on the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill said in a 194 page report it was satisfied the value of so-called Internet Connection Records to law enforcement agencies "could outweigh the intrusiveness involved in collecting and using them".  But it echoed concerns from tech firms about the feasibility of protecting users' privacy in the way Mrs May has promised, by only collecting the names of websites visited, rather than individual web pages.  The committee was told this might not be technically possible, but it said the Home Office was working with the industry to find a solution.  Ministers must also spell out their plans on encryption to ensure that they will not force tech firms to provide a "back door" for spies, the parliamentary committee said.  And the Home Office must also provide greater justification for the sweeping up of emails and other internet traffic passing through the UK by the security services, as revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, and other so-called "bulk" data gathering exercises.  Committee chairman Lord Murphy of Torfaen said the Home Office had a "significant amount of further work to do before Parliament can be confident that the provisions have been fully thought through".  The bill was criticised as "a dragnet approach" and "disproportionate" by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to pass spying legislation, dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, when he was in government.  The Lib Dem MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Home Office wanted to "collect everything on everyone" in order to find the information on suspected terrorists or criminals they are looking for.  "Implying that everyone may be guilty when millions of innocent people are just going about their everyday business free of any wrongdoing at all is... something which is not in keeping with long-standing British traditions," Mr Clegg said.  He asked if it was "proportionate in a liberal democracy to retain information on everything from the music you download on Spotify, to the app that you open, to the supermarket website that you visit, in order to go after the bad guys?"  He said he favoured a "narrower approach" to data retention, and that other countries concentrate on collecting data on those people who "flicker on the radar screen of security services in the first place."  Much of the vast bill is devoted to the activities of Britain's intelligence agencies, and is focused on making clear the legal basis under which they operate, following Edward Snowden's revelations.  It proposes "equipment interference" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.  Other warrants will cover the downloading of "bulk" databases of personal data, which could include medical records, and the sweeping up internet traffic passing through the UK for future analysis by GCHQ.  Some of these techniques were not known to the public until recently and were covered by disparate and obscure pieces of legislation, some of which predated the internet.	politics

A third (34%) felt their child's diagnosis was delayed and half of those felt this had an impact on prognosis.  Cancer charity CLIC Sargent is calling for the government to ensure better training and guidance for professionals who care for children before diagnosis.  NHS England said new guidance had lowered the referral threshold for GPS.  The research by CLIC Sargent, released to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, is based on a survey of 333 people - 147 young people aged 16-24 and 186 parents.  The charity says each year about 3,800 children and young people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK.  About 44% of the young people surveyed said they felt they were not taken seriously enough, making multiple trips to the GP or hospital before they were eventually diagnosed.  Over half - 53% - of the young people felt they had received a delayed diagnosis. Of these, 93% believed the perceived delay added to their emotional stress.  In 2010, I felt some lymph node lumps in my neck and became obsessive about it, I knew something was wrong.  I kept going back to the same doctor for six or seven months and he kept telling me that I was fine and there was nothing wrong, I didn't have cancer.  My family and friends kept teasing me, they thought I was being a hypochondriac.  In January 2011 I saw another GP, who told me to come back in two weeks if things hadn't changed. When they didn't, I was referred to hospital.  My diagnosis was sort of a relief more than anything - obviously I knew something was wrong and now it was getting dealt with.  Looking back at it now, doctors can't be expected to know everything. Maybe this doctor had not dealt with any young people with cancer, so maybe he just thought it was something innocent.  CLIC Sargent wants the NHS to conduct more research into the impact a delayed diagnosis has on a child or young person's health outcome, treatment and survival rate.  63% of parents said the delay had a negative effect on the emotional wellbeing of their child.  CLIC Sargent chief executive Kate Lee said: "It is simply not acceptable that so many of the parents and young people we spoke to felt their GP didn't take their concerns seriously or that their knowledge of their child's health wasn't recognised.  "It is absolutely vital that medical professionals including GPs are confident and skilled in listening and talking to children, young people and parents - and responding to their concerns. That's why we're calling for health education bodies to make this a core element of professional training."  As part of its research, the charity also commissioned a survey of 1,000 GPs. It found 46% felt more training was needed to help them identify cancer in children and young people, while 50% said more consultation time would be beneficial.  Ms Lee added: "It is striking that so many GPs feel more can be done to help them identify suspected cancer. Cancer in children and young people is thankfully rare so a GP may only have one or two cases in their whole career."  Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: "Early diagnosis must be of the highest priority for cancer patients of all ages. This report highlights the challenges of identifying cancer in children, and shows the vital need for everyone, including GPs, to be more aware of the early signs.  "NICE guidance has been recently updated to lower the referral threshold for GPs, and we have begun a major programme of work to test innovative ways to diagnose cancer more quickly in all patients."  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

Being unfit at the age of 40 is linked with a smaller brain volume at 60, according to a US study.  Fitness in middle age may be particularly important for people with early signs of heart disease, say researchers at Boston University.  The study adds to growing evidence that heart health can affect brain health in later life.  The study, published in the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, followed 1,583 people with an average age of 40.  The participants, who did not have dementia or heart disease, took a treadmill test, followed by another two decades later, along with MRI brain scans.  "We found a direct correlation in our study between poor fitness and brain volume decades later, which indicates accelerated brain ageing," said lead researcher Dr Nicole Spartano, of the Boston University School of Medicine.  "While not yet studied on a large scale, these results suggest that fitness in middle age may be particularly important for the many millions of people around the world who already have evidence of heart disease," she added.  Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "While it's hard to conclude from these kinds of studies whether one factor definitely caused the other, the findings add to a growing body of evidence that poor cardiovascular health throughout life could have a negative effect on the brain.  "Current evidence suggests the best way to maintain a healthy brain is to keep physically and mentally active, eat a balanced diet, not smoke, drink only within recommended limits and keep diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol in check."	health

Pensions scheme members reported "hardship, distress and inconvenience" caused by the late payment of pensions, the NAO said.  MyCSP said its performance was now back to a "steady state".  The PCS union said the mutualisation had been "a textbook case in how not to reform public services".  MyCSP, a joint venture between government and private sector firm Equiniti, took over civil service pensions administration from Capita in September 2014.  In a report on Thursday Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office said the mutual "did not cope with the workload and a large backlog of work built up".  "Some people were paid late and members struggled to contact MyCSP," he added.  Due to a lack of staff, a backlog of work grew, peaking at 22,000 urgent cases in January 2015, and many thousands of calls went unanswered.  Between September 2014 and March 2015, MyCSP failed to answer 99,408 calls, the NAO said.  The mutual was unable to prioritise urgent cases once a backlog had built up because of the way its system ran, NAO added.  In January 2015 the Cabinet Office told the mutual to develop a plan to tackle the backlog.  By September 2015 MyCSP had managed to re-establish previous performance levels and was not hit with any financial penalties, the NAO added.  MyCSP said: "We recognise the findings of the National Audit Office report published today.  "It has been well documented that a number of factors led to the reduction in service levels, including a communication to 1.1 million members which resulted in significantly increased call volumes and a corresponding impact on 'business as usual' workload."  It added that it had recruited new staff, increased call centre opening times, and started in-house training.  "Call handling levels have been back to normal for the past six months, with a corresponding reduction in member complaints, significantly down from their peak at the time of the service challenges," it said.  "Service to members remains our utmost priority and we will continue to work with... the Cabinet Office and employers to deliver towards that aim," MyCSP added.  The PCS union said the NAO report had "exposed the failings of the government's only mutual venture in a damning verdict on the administration of civil service pensions".  The new pension administration IT system, Compendia, was not fully ready when MyCSP took on the extra work, PCS said.  Compendia was developed by Equiniti, which took over a controlling stake in the mutual in 2014, PCS added.  PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: "The mutualisation of MyCSP has from the start been a textbook case in how not to reform public services."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35546369	Junior doctors' row: BMA rejects 'final' contract offer	Junior doctors' leaders have rejected a "final take-it-or-leave-it" offer made by the government to settle the bitter contract dispute in England.  The offer included a concession on Saturday pay, but the British Medical Association said it was not enough.  The development is expected to lead ministers to announce that they are going to impose a contract on doctors.  The news has emerged as doctors took part in their second 24-hour strike - which ended at 08:00 GMT on Thursday.  The contract offered by the government would have seen those working at least one in four Saturdays get extra pay for each of the Saturdays they work. The move represented a more generous offer than previously, when the bar for extra pay was set at one in three.  The proposal also included increasing fines levied against trusts for over-working doctors, and increasing the extra pay medics get for very long hours.  The offer was made on Tuesday evening, on the eve of the strike, and rejected by the BMA on Wednesday afternoon when the walk-out was in full swing.  During the strike doctors provided emergency cover, but the stoppage led to the cancellation of nearly 3,000 routine operations and treatments. GP care was largely unaffected.  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  The offer was made by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in by ministers last month to broker a deal in the bitter dispute.  In his letter to the British Medical Association (BMA) on Tuesday, he said it was a final offer and that if it was rejected it would mean there is "no realistic prospect of a negotiated agreement".  But the BMA rejected the offer, sticking to its stance that any Saturday working should attract higher pay.  The letter reiterated the union's proposal made previously that basic pay be increased by only about half the 11% offered by ministers to help pay for it.  The government is now waiting for Sir David to confirm that he sees no way of resolving the dispute.  It is then expected ministers will move to impose a new contract on England's 55,000 junior doctors, who represent a third of the medical workforce.  The new contracts would then come into force from August. They would apply to all new junior doctors immediately but would also be imposed as existing junior doctors changed their rotations - it is expected 80% would be on it within six months.  It is unclear at the moment how the BMA will respond to that prospect, although their mandate allows them to call more strikes.  BMA junior doctors leader Dr Johann Malawana said the government had "attacked" and "patronised" the profession.  "The health secretary can end this dispute, but he must put politics to one side and concentrate on agreeing a fair contract that delivers for patients."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35371074	Labour's tortured relationship with the nuclear deterrent it created	Clement Attlee is revered on the left as the father of the NHS and the welfare state. What is less celebrated, but no less true, is his role as the father of Britain's nuclear bomb.  It was Attlee, as Labour's post-war prime minister, who made sure Britain got its own "nuclear deterrent", committing millions to its development at a time when the country was technically bankrupt.  He did it in secret, without a debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, partly out of a desire to avoid damaging rows.  The rows would come soon enough - and are continuing to split the party more than 70 years later, as Jeremy Corbyn wrestles with the seemingly impossible task of reconciling its pro and anti-nuclear factions.  Attlee had his reasons for wanting Britain to become a nuclear-armed nation. He had just been elected prime minister when America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in August 1945.  He realised in an instant that the air raid wardens and fire engines that had fought to limit the damage done by Nazi bombs, were now useless in the face of the awesome destructive power of this new weapon. The only way to protect the population, he reasoned, was to have the ability to fight back.  "The answer to an atomic bomb on London is an atomic bomb on another great city," he wrote in a secret memo to a cabinet committee 22 days after Hiroshima.  This is the concept of a nuclear deterrent and "mutually assured destruction" in embryo.  But Attlee was no warmonger. He wanted to rid the world of the menace of nuclear war by handing control of the weapons to the United Nations, even arguing that information about the bomb should be shared with the Soviet Union.  "He immediately recognised the potential importance of nuclear weapons both for the conduct of war and for the conduct of international relations," wrote Len Scott, former professor of international history at Aberystwyth University in an essay on Labour and the bomb.  But at the same time, added Prof Scott, he believed that Britain must have its own bomb, a need that became more pressing when the Americans passed a law, in August 1946, preventing it from sharing atomic secrets with other nations, including its closest wartime allies Britain and Canada, whose scientists had worked alongside the Americans to develop the Hiroshima bomb at Los Alamos.  Debate raged in cabinet committees between those, like Chancellor Hugh Dalton, who argued that Britain could not afford a bomb, or the new V-force aircraft needed to deliver it, and those who argued that the country needed to keep its place at the top table and avoid being humiliated by the Americans.  "We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs," foreign secretary, and former trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, is reported to have told one committee.  "We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it."  A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement  Is there such a thing as a nuclear button?  How important is Trident to the UK's security and international standing?  Bevin's national prestige argument won the day - and it would surface again in 1957, when Attlee's successor as Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, hit back at growing calls from Labour MPs for Britain to get rid of it nuclear weapons by telling that year's party conference the unilateralists were gripped by an "an emotional spasm" that would send a future Labour foreign secretary "naked into the conference chamber".  Labour's leadership argued at the time that Britain should only abandon its weapons if it could persuade other countries, such as China and France, to do likewise (persuading the Soviet Union and the US to disarm was seen as a non-starter).  But the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was at the height of its influence within the party, arguing on moral grounds against weapons of mass destruction, with the Hydrogen bomb, a vastly more powerful weapon, recently tested by Britain, looming over the debate.  CND's calls for Britain to unilaterally scrap its weapons briefly became party policy, before being overturned at the 1961 conference.  Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson fought the 1964 general election questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent, declaring in Labour's manifesto that Polaris, American nuclear weapons to be fitted to British-built submarines under an agreement brokered by Tory PM Harold Macmillan, "will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter".  Attlee was even wheeled out, in a party election broadcast, to denounce the independent deterrent as a "nonsense".  But the manifesto did not include an explicit commitment to abandon Polaris, just reassess the deal with the Americans, and although Wilson reduced the number of submarines from five to four, and brokered a non-proliferation treaty, Polaris became operational in 1968, beginning the round-the-clock patrols that continue to this day.  The left felt betrayed by Wilson and when Labour unexpectedly went into opposition after the 1970 general election the party renewed its commitment to scrap Polaris and end moves towards a new generation of nuclear weapons, neither of which it did when it returned to power in 1974.  When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, the nuclear issue erupted with renewed ferocity in the Labour Party, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union.  It had now become a hugely symbolic issue for the party, a key dividing line between the left and right, who would eventually break away to form their own party, the SDP, to fight the 1983 general election.  Then Labour leader Michael Foot, a founder member of CND, was a unilateralist, who also vowed to remove US nuclear weapons from British soil. His successor Neil Kinnock, was also a unilateralist, although he would drop the policy after losing the 1987 election, arguing that the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through negotiation between nuclear-armed nations.  Kinnock had united the party behind scrapping nuclear weapons by arguing that the money spent on Trident - the replacement for Polaris - should go towards bolstering Britain's conventional forces instead, but he still faced accusations from the Conservatives that he was "soft" on defence and would make Britain a target for Soviet invasion.  There were also questions about how Labour could scrap its weapons on moral grounds yet still expect to shelter under America's "nuclear umbrella" and how it could remain a member of nuclear-armed NATO.  Tony Blair banished unilateralism from New Labour's vocabulary, along with other policies thought to be harming its credibility with centre ground voters.  But the nuclear issue still had the power to split the party - in 2006 he faced his biggest rebellion since the Iraq war over plans to push ahead with a replacement for Trident, when 88 Labour MPs voted against the government. The backing of the Conservatives ensured Blair won the vote convincingly.  His argument to MPs was that Trident was the "ultimate insurance" and that it would be "unwise and dangerous" for Britain to unilaterally give up its nuclear capability.  One of the rebels who spoke against Blair that night was veteran backbencher and CND stalwart Jeremy Corbyn, who quoted the mayor of Hiroshima in his speech, who had "pleaded" with Britain not to "develop a new generation of nuclear missiles".  "We face an important decision tonight," said the Islington North MP.  "Either we endorse this vast expenditure, or we encourage a public debate that I believe will come down on the side of sanity, sense and peace in the world, and we do not go ahead with this vast expenditure that can lead only to a more dangerous world."  The idea that Corbyn would one day succeed Blair as Labour leader, and re-open the party's debate about unilateral disarmament, would have seemed pretty far-fetched to the MPs in the Commons chamber that night, including Corbyn himself. But he has now has the chance he has long craved to persuade the public of the "sanity" of his case.  Labour has tended to be gripped by internal rows about scrapping nuclear weapons when it has been in opposition for some years, only to maintain the deterrent when it returns to power.  But, as the party's resurgent unilateralists point out, this is the first time Labour has seriously debated the issue in a post-Cold War context. It is a very different world to the one facing Attlee in 1945.  The challenge for Labour's defence review, headed by Emily Thornberry, is to avoid the Cold War thinking that still tends dominates both sides of the debate and see the issue with fresh eyes.  Given the party's tortured history, that will not be easy.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35543870	English votes system 'unstable' warn MPs	The new system of "English Votes for English Laws" is overly complicated and may not last long, MPs have warned.  The Public Administration Select Committee said the arrangement could end up as a "short term experiment" due to levels of opposition in the Commons.  Legislation deemed to affect England, or England and Wales only, is now subject to an extra stage of scrutiny, involving only MPs elected there.  Ministers said it was an "important balance" to devolution elsewhere.  The rules, introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland, were activated in the House of Commons for the first time last month.  English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies, as part of a new stage in the legislative process for considering bills applying only to their constituents.  In a report on the new system, the cross-party committee of MPs said there was "strong English demand" for measures to address the "constitutional anomalies" that devolution had brought.  But it said the new provisions were "ad hoc", lacked transparency and appeared incompatible with the 40-year old Barnett Formula for distributing funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  "The new standing orders do require further consideration and evaluation if they are to be anything more than a short-term experiment in the House's internal procedure," the MPs said.  "That former clerks of the House of Commons - individuals steeped in decades of learning about Parliamentary procedure - should have difficulty in discerning what these standing orders mean should raise serious further doubts about how sustainable they are."  The report said the test for whether legislation applied only to England, which is determined by the Commons Speaker, was not "very simple" and risked putting the Speaker in an "unnecessarily controversial position".  The extent of the opposition to the system, which has united Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist Party, "underlined their vulnerability", the committee said.  The SNP has said the changes are "driving Scotland out of the door".  "With only the Conservative Party in favour of the new arrangements, these standing orders face a high risk of being overridden as soon as there is a non-Conservative majority in the House of Commons," it said.  "That the standing orders have attracted such hostility and can be removed on the basis of a simple majority must raise doubts as to whether they can ever be more than a temporary expedient, and currently they cannot be considered to be part of a stable constitutional settlement that will endure."  Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said the new system had little cross-party support and urged ministers to come back with "more comprehensible proposals" during a review later this year.  A government spokesman said: "The government is committed to a stronger Union and a fair settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom, and English votes for English laws brings an important balance to the unprecedented powers that have been devolved to other parts of the country.  "We will be reviewing the operation of the standing orders later this year, drawing upon the work of both the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the House of Commons Procedure Committee."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35541962	Junior doctors' row: Time for the nuclear option?	News that doctors have rejected a final "take-it-or-leave-it" offer means the nuclear option - imposition - is now a real possibility.  Over the past week ministers and their officials have been putting real thought into how and when they should make their move. Given the latest developments, expect it any day.  Why now? Quite simply, they've been told the time has come. Senior NHS officials have advised them that the health service needs to start making plans if a new contract is to be brought in this summer as planned.  That's because hospitals would need to carry out a detailed review of rotas and staffing before contract offers are made in May, in time for the August start date.  But once that has been done, the contract could be imposed quickly. Within six months about 80% of junior doctors would be on a new contract - this is because as trainees, most of them quickly rotate through jobs.  That's the theory anyway. But imposition is fraught with difficulties - and ministers know this. If they do impose the contract there will be a collective holding of breath in the corridors of power as they wait to see what junior doctors do next.  That's because the anger and determination of the profession to resist these changes has time and again taken ministers by surprise.  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  Analysis: Why should we care?  So how would the BMA react? The union has so far refused to be drawn on the issue in detail publicly.  One option is to carry on with strikes, which they have the mandate to do - although privately there is concern within the union that they could lose public support if they do (the latest poll by Ipsos MORI shows two-thirds back the medics).  Legal challenges are also being discussed behind the scenes, while a mass non-signing of the contract or symbolic resignation from the NHS could take place - but if doctors subsequently turned up at work it could be argued they're effectively accepting the terms.  The fact is there are limited options. The NHS is effectively a monopoly employer after all.  But it would be a risk though to assume that doesn't mean there will be no impact on the numbers staying in the health service. Already one in two doctors who finish the foundation stage of their training - the first two years after graduating from medical school - step off the junior doctor training ladder by not going straight into speciality training.  Some go abroad - to travel and to work - while others are tempted by opportunities in alternative sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry and (apparently) cruise liners who employ ship doctors. And Scotland and Wales would no doubt welcome some of the best English trainees into their health systems given half the chance.  Significant numbers are also working as locums in the NHS, in the knowledge that the demand for doctors means there is good money to be earned by working in a freelance capacity.  Of course, many of these medics do end up returning to training. But even under the existing contract that has not been enough to fill the gaps - there are shortages in a whole host of specialities from GPs to A&E.  If the government does go ahead with imposition and that situation is made worse, questions will be asked in years to come whether the government did the right thing. Imposition may solve a short-term problem, but the long-term effect is unknown. The stakes could not be higher.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35540433	Commons votes to end automatic naming of arrested MPs	Any arrested MP will not automatically be identified in the Commons after MPs backed changes to its procedures.  In future, the MP involved will be consulted and named only if there is an issue of "parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance" at stake.  The cross-party Procedure Committee said revealing names of arrested MPs was incompatible with a privacy right.  Chairman Charles Walker said he was not asking for special treatment for MPs but for the law to be applied equally.  The Commons approved changes to the existing rules, which require the police to notify the Speaker when an MP is arrested and for the Speaker in turn to tell the House, without a vote.  Mr Walker, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, told the Commons that MPs should have the same rights to privacy as any other citizen, and in future their names should not be put in the public domain if they were arrested, unless this was directly connected to their role as an MP.  But Labour MP John Mann argued that it would give MPs special rights in law that do not apply to everyone else.  Deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said it was up to the Commons to decide although the government has indicated that the change brings MPs into line with the rest of the public.  The Procedure Committee's recent report revealed that in the last Parliament, Tory MPs Nigel Evans and David Ruffley were named after their arrests. Mr Evans was later acquitted of sexual offences and Mr Ruffley cautioned for assault.  Green MP Caroline Lucas was arrested during an anti-fracking protest and later acquitted of obstruction.  Meanwhile it has emerged that police have been involved in a total of five cases linked to MPs' expenses under the current system, with none of the politicians identified.  In December it emerged that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the MPs' expenses watchdog, had referred three potentially criminal cases to police in March without any public announcement, or identifying the individuals involved.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35542911	Junior doctors' row: Time 'running out' to reach deal	Time is running out to agree a deal with junior doctors in the long-running dispute, a key government negotiator is warning, as doctors in England take part in their second 24-hour strike.  NHS Employers boss Danny Mortimer, who has led the talks for ministers, said the NHS needed "certainty".  It comes amid mounting speculation ministers are ready to force a contract on England's 55,000 trainee medics.  The latest strike is due to end at 08:00 on Thursday.  The walk-out has already led to the cancellation of nearly 3,000 non-emergency operations and treatments, as well as causing disruption to routine check-ups and appointments.  Mr Mortimer told the BBC that imposition of a contract was a matter for ministers.  But he said that during talks, the government's team had responded to a "whole series of concerns and issues" which had led to an "improved contract offer".  "This issue, which has now been going on for four years in terms of trying to find a new contract, can't go on for ever.  "The NHS needs some certainty in terms of how it moves forwards," he added.  Hospital bosses have told ministers they will need to let the health service know this month whether they are going to proceed with the contract as rotas and staffing arrangements need to be reviewed before contract offers are made in May.  But any move to impose a contract is likely to be accompanied by a review of training covering areas outside the contract negotiations. It is unclear exactly what this will include, but ministers are believed to see it as a way to try to soften the anger forcing the deal on to the profession will cause.  The BBC understands that the Government is set to announce a review of junior doctors' training in England covering areas outside the contract negotiations  Responding to questions about imposition, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped it "doesn't get to that".  He said the contract on offer would mean "we can offer better care for patients".  But BMA junior doctors' leader Johann Malawana said the government should not force a contract on doctors and should "put [the] NHS before politics, patients before machismo".  Formal talks at the conciliation service Acas broke down in January and at the moment there are no more planned.  The key sticking point appears to be payments for working on Saturdays, following progress in other areas including patient safety and night-time shift patterns.  The government wants Saturdays to be classed as a normal working day, but the British Medical Association has said it will forgo half of the 11% rise in basic pay it has been offered to keep Saturday premium payments.  But as tensions rise, hospital leaders and patient groups have urged the two sides to have one last go at reaching a deal.  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: "This really does need to reach a conclusion.  "I think the ideal conclusion would be for employers to make a fair and final reasonable offer and for the BMA to accept it."  And Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, added: "A lasting agreement must be found to prevent still further disruption for patients and raise the morale of hard-working junior doctors."

During Wednesday's strike, junior doctors are once again providing emergency cover, while consultants are still working in hospitals and GPs in the community.  NHS England said just over 40% of junior doctors had turned up to work - although it is thought the majority of these would have been those who were working in emergency care.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35535704	Operations hit as doctors strike again	Nearly 3,000 operations have been cancelled as junior doctors in England take part in a second 24-hour strike over pay and conditions.  Check-ups, appointments and tests are also set to be disrupted as a result of the walkout, which began at 08:00 GMT.  Formal talks broke down in January and there is mounting speculation ministers may soon seek to impose a new contract, potentially inflaming the row further.  The key sticking point appears to be payments for working on Saturdays.  The BBC understands talks have started taking place within the government after NHS bosses told ministers that if they wanted to see a new contract introduced, they would have to make their move this month to ensure it was in place by the summer.  It raises the possibility of a series of rolling strikes as the dispute threatens to escalate even further.  There are more than 50,000 junior doctors in England - the term covers those who are fresh out of medical school through to others who have a decade of experience behind them.  Talks between them and the government, hosted by conciliation service Acas, broke down at the end of January and despite some informal discussions behind the scenes, there is thought to be little prospect of them restarting.  BMA junior doctor leader Johann Malawana said the government should not force a contract on doctors and should "put [the] NHS before politics, patients before machismo".  But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the BMA was the "only reason" a solution had not been found.  What patients need to know  How close did both sides get to a deal?  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  The walkout comes after doctors took part in strike action on 12 January, which led to 4,000 operations and treatments being cancelled - one in 10 of the total.  During Wednesday's strike, junior doctors are once again providing emergency cover, while consultants are working in hospitals and GPs in the community.  NHS England said just over 40% of junior doctors turned up to work - although it is thought the majority of these would have been those who were working in emergency care.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35534463	Housing: Corbyn and Cameron clash over 'right-to-buy'	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused David Cameron of presiding over a "very damaging housing crisis," at Prime Minister's Questions.  Mr Corbyn said the PM had failed to replace homes sold off under "right-to-buy", which is being extended to housing association tenants in England.  He said the government's action on housing was "simply not good enough".  Mr Cameron hit back by saying he would "increase the housing supply in the social sector".  He said two new homes would be built for each one sold off by local authorities in London, where shortages are the most acute.  But Mr Corbyn said measures in the Housing Bill would result in the loss of 180,000 affordable homes while only one in every eight council homes sold under "right-to-buy" had been replaced with a social home.  He accused Mr Cameron of "overseeing a very damaging housing crisis, it's pricing out people from buying, it's not providing enough social housing, therefore many people are forced to rely on the private rented sector".  A committee of MPs earlier warned that the flagship Conservative policy of housing association tenants in England, the "right-to-buy" their homes, could reduce the stock of affordable housing.  Those taking advantage of it will get a discount, to be funded by the sale of "high value" council houses.  But the Commons communities and Local Government committee says this could leave councils short of cash to replace sold-off properties.  It predicts a "substantial surge" of demand to buy homes from the 1.3 million housing association tenants in England when the new scheme comes into effect, leading to the risk that the policy will "stall" for lack of funds.  It also raises concerns that a 1% rent cut for four years imposed on housing associations would threaten their ability to build new homes and provide other services to tenants.  The government says it wants to ensure "anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream".  But the Communities and Local Government committee says the funding model it is using, which will force councils to compensate housing associations with the money raised from council house sales, is "extremely questionable" and is effectively a "levy" on councils.  It says the scheme should be funded by central government and questions how ministers are going to meet their target of replacing every property sold off with a new one.  Potential buyers must have been tenants for at least three years, the same as with council tenants.  The government says that means up to 1.3 million housing association tenants will be eligible in England. Around 500,000 housing association tenants are already eligible for some discounts. So the new scheme will extend rights to a further 800,000 tenants, and increase the discounts available.  Committee chairman Clive Betts said: "The fundamental success of this policy depends not just on whether more tenants come to own their home but on whether more homes are built.  "The government needs to set out in more detail how it will meet its target of at least one-for-one replacement of the sold homes, particularly given issues such as the availability of land, the capacity of the building industry and the uncertainty of income from council home sales."  The scheme, which is partly designed to reverse the steady decline in home ownership levels in recent years, is currently being piloted in Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Merseyside and a number of London boroughs.  It will be phased in across the rest of England in due course, although it is voluntary - housing associations are not being forced to adopt it. The government is updating interested tenants on its progress here.  Housing associations taking part in the scheme will be expected to sell properties to tenants interested in buying them at a discount of £103,900 in London and £77,900 elsewhere.  The government is committed to building 400,000 new affordable homes by 2020-21.  Under the the Housing Bill currently going through Parliament, local authorities make payments to government based on the value of their housing stock, on the expectation that more expensive properties would be disposed of when falling empty.  Ministers say that the sums raised from selling "high-value" council homes will pay not only for "right to buy" discounts, but also for the construction of cheaper social housing to replace them and a new £1bn Brownfield Regeneration Fund to support building on derelict land.  But the committee's report quotes estimates from the Chartered Institute of Housing which suggest that the sale of high-value homes will raise only £1.2bn - £2.2bn a year of the £4.5bn needed.  The committee warns that the amount raised from the sale of vacant council homes will vary across the country, depending on property prices.  It warned that a large number of properties sold through the existing right-to-buy scheme had quickly been put on the rental market and that it might be necessary to limit the ability of housing association tenants to become private sector landlords.  It also called for safeguards to protect the amount of affordable housing in rural areas, including allowing housing associations to offer tenants "portable discounts" to purchase an alternative property to the one they live in where it was difficult to replace.  The Department for Communities and Local Government said more details about the sale of vacant council houses would be set out in due course but the principle of using them to pay for new house building was the right one.  "There are billions of pounds locked up in local authority housing assets. It is only right that when they become vacant they are sold enabling the receipts to be reinvested in building new homes and supporting home ownership through right-to-buy," a spokesman said.  He added: "Anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream."  Labour housing spokesman John Healey said: "Government policies should be funded by government, not a cash-grab from councils forced to sell off their own housing to pay for right-to-buy discounts.  "Unless the legislation is changed, ministers will force cash-strapped councils to pay for their pet policy project."  The Labour government in Wales is planning to abolish right-to-buy entirely while in Scotland it will be phased out by August. A separate scheme exists in Northern Ireland.	politics

Jose Manuel Barroso said plans for an "emergency brake" on in-work benefits for migrants was a creative compromise but would not reduce immigration.  He said the EU would be "weaker" if the UK voted to leave in a referendum.  He spoke out as the six founding members of the EU recommitted to building an "ever closer union".  PM David Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership this month and then hold a referendum on whether the UK stays in the EU.  Leaders will debate the proposals in Brussels on 18 and 19 February. Mr Cameron requires the approval of all 28 EU members for the package, which includes limiting in-work benefits for migrants for up to four years.  Speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Mr Barroso described the UK as "one of the most important shareholders in Europe".  But the former Portuguese prime minister said: "The way the British look at Europe is frankly different from the way France, or Germany do.  "It is not only Britain that cares about sovereignty, we all want the rights of our country respected," he added.  He was speaking as the foreign ministers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands resolved "to continue the process of creating an ever closer union".  But, reflecting the differing view in the UK, they acknowledged that not every country should have to agree.  Mr Cameron says his draft deal aimed at keeping Britain in the EU would deliver "substantial change".  The deal includes an "emergency brake" on in-work benefits paid to EU migrants and paves the way for the UK's referendum to take place as early as June.  However, when asked whether the proposed measures on in-work benefits would put anyone off from coming to the UK, Mr Barroso replied: "No, frankly not."  "People who want to go to Britain, if the basic rights of the people are ensured, they will be willing to go but of course with slightly different conditions," he said.  Mr Barroso, who stood down from the European Commission last year after 10 years as the EU executive's president, said: "Everyone wants Britain to remain."  Reacting to his interview, a spokesman for Vote Leave - which is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU - told the BBC: "Even the EU's biggest advocate knows the PM's renegotiation is trivial.  "The final package won't bring powers home, won't cut the cost of Brussels and won't fix the fundamental flaws at the heart of the European project."  The exchanges came as the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign unveiled 30 new cross-party recruits - ten each from the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems.  And in other developments on Wednesday a report by Migration Watch said that 1.8 million illegal border crossings had been recorded by the EU border agency Frontex in 2015.  It says another three million migrants were expected over the next two years, adding that Greece and Italy "cannot possibly cope with such numbers", yet only 683 migrants have been returned.  Arron Banks, co-founder of Leave.EU, said: "This scandalous policy and security shambles demonstrates how the EU cannot control its borders and why it is heading for further catastrophe this summer."  On Tuesday papers released ahead of next week's crunch summit suggest any agreement on changes to the UK's membership of the EU would be "legally binding".  Draft conclusions of the summit, issued in advance, state any deal would be "fully compatible with EU treaties".  If Mr Cameron can secure agreement from the other 27 EU member countries, he is expected to proceed with an in-out referendum on the UK's membership by the end of June.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35536890	EU referendum: UK renegotiation would be 'legally binding'	Any agreement on changes to the UK's membership of the EU would be "legally binding", papers released ahead of next week's crunch summit have indicated.  David Cameron hopes to get agreement for his proposed renegotiation at a meeting of EU leaders on 18 February, paving the way for a future referendum.  Draft conclusions of the summit, issued in advance, state any deal would be "fully compatible with EU treaties".  No more detail is given about the final agreement still being negotiated.  The two-day meeting is a crucial moment in the debate over the UK's future in the EU. Mr Cameron requires the approval of all 28 EU members for a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership outlined earlier this month.  If he secures it, he is expected to proceed with an in-out referendum on the UK's membership by the end of June.  However, a former president of the European Commission has cast doubts on the likely impact of plans to limit payments of in-works benefits to EU migrants, which Mr Cameron has claimed is one of his main negotiating achievements and will affect the numbers coming to the UK.  Jose Manuel Barroso told the BBC's Newsnight programme that a proposed four-year emergency brake on benefits was a "creative and intelligent compromise" that upheld the central principle of freedom of movement and could win the backing of all member states.  But asked whether it would put anyone off from coming to the UK, he replied: "No, frankly not", adding that levels of immigration would be dependent on future labour market conditions.  "People who want to go to Britain, if the basic rights of the people are ensured, they will be willing to go but of course with slightly different conditions," he said.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum  EU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?  Referendum timeline: What will happen when?  The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?  The BBC's Brussels correspondent Ben Wright said draft conclusions are always circulated to member states a couple of weeks before EU summits and usually leaked to the media.  Drafts, he pointed out, often change significantly before the final agreed text.  The documents issued by the European Council on Tuesday briefly restate the broad areas of negotiation set out last week - including proposed limits on the payments of migrants' benefits, new powers for national parliaments and safeguards for countries outside the eurozone.  They also state that if EU leaders endorse the agreement, the new arrangements would become effective on the date the UK government informed the Council it was staying in the EU, were that to be the outcome of the referendum.  Amid continuing speculation about the timing of the referendum, one Conservative Eurosceptic MP has urged Mr Cameron to "bring it on".  Speaking during a Commons debate on the issue, Sir Edward Leigh said those seeking a British exit from the EU know their arguments and are confident of winning.  "We say to the prime minister: 'bring it on'. No delay, don't look worried, bring it on and we can have a proper debate and we can win this."  No date has yet been announced for the referendum although Downing Street is reported to favour staging the poll on 23 June.  The SNP, Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein all object to this, saying it would be too close to elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 7 May, while the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, has also called for it to be deferred until the autumn.  Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond accused the prime minister of "gambling this country's entire European future on his sham negotiation and this shame of a campaign".  He described the lead up to the referendum as "thoroughly depressing", attacking Mr Cameron's suggestion that leaving the EU could lead to migrant camps like the "Jungle" in Calais being set up in the UK.  "The truth is, of course, it doesn't matter," he said. "It would take at least five years to withdraw from the European treaties. By then we could have 10 times the number of refugees or indeed, we could have none at all.  "No one knows how it would affect the bilateral arrangements between Britain and France. It is pointless, pathetic, puerile debate - typical of what looks like it is going to be, a depressing campaign - the political equivalent, I would suggest, of a no score draw."  Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said political figures in France indicated they would like to see an end to "juxtaposed" border controls in Calais, which allow UK officials to check passports on French soil.  He told the Commons Home Affairs committee: "That is certainly not our view. The French government have indicated that is not their view. But the situation could change. That sense of certainty is what the prime minister is pointing to and the impact if the juxtaposed controls were changed."	politics

Charles Walker said claims by Channel 4 News that some bills were not included in local spending returns during three 2014 by-elections and in Thanet South in May's election should be examined.  The Tories say all their spending was recorded in accordance with the law.  Channel 4 News said it had obtained hotel bills which suggest the party broke electoral rules in the Newark, Clacton and Rochester & Strood by-elections, the first of which the Conservatives won and the other two it lost to UKIP.  Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.  But Channel 4 News says it has uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.  It found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.  Charles Walker, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, told Channel 4 News that the matter should be examined.  "I'm going to raise it at the board but I suspect others will be raising it at the board. These are serious allegations," he said.  "I'm not diminishing the nature of these allegations. But the Conservative Party believes it has complied with election law."  Labour's candidate in the 2014 Newark by-election, Michael Payne, has written to his local chief constable asking for an investigation.  "Channel 4 appear to be in possession of documents which raise questions relating to spending by the Conservative Party during the 2014 Newark by-election; the questions raised allegedly relate to spending that appears not to have been declared," he wrote.  "I am seeking assurance this evidence and matter will be investigated, and if necessary referred to the appropriate authorities in order to reassure the residents of Newark constituency that established electoral laws and procedures, which are designed to protect our democracy have been complied with."  Nottinghamshire Police are yet to respond to the letter.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who lost a fiercely contested battle with the Conservatives in Thanet South last year, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.  A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said it was aware of the allegations.  "Alleged breaches of the rules around candidate spending at by-elections or parliamentary general elections are matters for the police to investigate under the Representation of the People Act 1983," he said.  A Conservative spokeswoman said: "All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35534469	Corbyn plotters told to 'stop sniping' by union boss	Unite leader Len McCluskey has accused a "cabal" of Labour MPs of plotting against their leader Jeremy Corbyn.  The union boss said some Labour MPs did not accept Mr Corbyn's mandate although their alternative vision for the country was "stale and uninspiring".  In a speech in Oxford, he urged malcontents to "stop the sniping" and to "take the fight" to the Tories.  Mr Corbyn has faced criticism of his leadership and stance on issues such as defence and counter-terrorism.  His handling of a shadow cabinet reshuffle last month, in which one prominent critic was sacked and opponents of the leader's position on Trident were sidelined, was widely criticised.  Earlier on Tuesday, a senior figure in the shadow cabinet said it might be impossible for the party to reach an agreed position on whether to renew the UK's nuclear weapons system.  But Mr McCluskey said it was time for those who have questioned the direction in which Mr Corbyn is taking the party to pipe down, saying the Labour leader deserved their loyalty.  "Their analysis of Labour's defeat in 2015 was unconvincing, their proposals stale, minimalist and uninspiring - and for the most part, they have still not shaped up after Corbyn's victory," he said. "Until they can do that, they are a plot without a programme; a cabal without a critique."  The "continual war of attrition" between different camps in the party was "achieving nothing beyond taking the pressure off the government", he said.  "So my clear message to the plotters is - stop the sniping, stop the scheming, get behind Jeremy Corbyn and start taking the fight to the Tories."  In his opposition to austerity and to foreign military interventions, Mr Corbyn was in tune with public opinion, Mr McCluskey said.  The Labour leader, he said, offered a "radical challenge to the status quo and business-as-usual politics", likening the insurgency which propelled him to victory in September's leadership contest to US Democratic politician Bernie Sanders' current bid for the White House.  "What Jeremy Corbyn offers - like Bernie Sanders in the US - is a calling out of corporate corruption, a rejection of the austerity that has made the UK the most unequal economy in the G8 and the promise that politics and politicians can and will put things right for ordinary working people."  And he criticised those who, he claimed, were suggesting May's elections in Scotland, Wales, and across England were a referendum on the Labour leadership.  "I am not a supporter of... changes designed to intimidate or undermine Labour MPs. But I also believe that we need to issue a clear warning to those who are advocating the parliamentary Labour Party being used as a lever to force Jeremy Corbyn out."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35528108	Trident: Getting agreed Labour position 'may be impossible'	Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham says it may be "impossible" for Labour to reach an agreed position on Trident.  Mr Burnham, who backs renewal of the UK's nuclear weapons, said a review by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry would be "very difficult".  Jeremy Corbyn backs unilateral nuclear disarmament and Scottish Labour has already adopted such a policy.  But Ms Thornberry has been accused of living in "la la land" amid claims the leadership might "fix" the outcome.  The shadow defence secretary received a hostile reception when she discussed the review at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday evening. Ex-shadow defence minister Kevan Jones said Ms Thornberry had taken questions "but didn't answer any", adding that she had been "waffly and incoherent".  Some MPs told reporters outside the room that she had said Trident could soon be as obsolete as the Spitfire fighter aircraft was after the Second World War.  Ms Thornberry said she had been trying to explain that Trident may be overtaken by technology such as underwater drones, which were being developed to track submarines.  "The idea of the Trident replacement is that it can hide in the sea. If technology is moving faster than that then it may well be that Trident may not be able to hide.  "And if that's right, and if we are to bet everything on 'mutually assured destruction', we have to be assured that it will work - and if it cannot hide any more then that is a problem."  She told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday that "four, five or six people kicked-off" at Monday evening's meeting of Labour MPs but they did not necessarily represent the whole Parliamentary party.  She said she had wanted to challenge those who had said "it has to be Trident" or nothing.  Asked why she did not just admit that she was against nuclear weapons, she said it was important to discuss all options.  "We need to have all the options on the table and we need to have a proper debate within the party," she told Today.  Labour peer Admiral Lord West, a former home office minister, telephoned into the Today programme during Ms Thornberry's interview to say that her argument about underwater drones was "nonsense".  She said the Chinese, Americans and Russians would not be spending billions on research if there was nothing in it.  Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.  The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.  The submarines carry up to 8 Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads.  Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system  Mr Burnham had earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We always knew this was going to be a difficult debate for the party - there are two positions here that are difficult to reconcile, maybe impossible to reconcile, and the party's got to find some way of accommodating those positions and move forward and not let this issue take over everything."  Defence analyst Paul Ingram, from the British American Security Information Council, said the advent of new technology meant it may no longer be possible for submarines to go undetected in 20 years.  This was a "particular problem" for the UK, he told BBC Radio 4's World at One, because it was the only nation that was "entirely dependent" on submarines for its nuclear capability.  Jeremy Corbyn is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons but some MPs and peers have threatened to resign if Labour reverses its decades-long support for British missiles. Others are understood to be thinking of making clear their personal support for Trident renewal to voters at the next election, if the party puts disarmament in its manifesto.  Ms Thornberry's review is due to be published in the summer but MPs could be asked to vote on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet before that.  Renewing the Trident fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade, is estimated by the government to cost £31bn, although opponents claim the final bill will be far higher than that.  Union leaders have warned that scrapping Trident could devastate communities reliant on the defence industry. But Scottish Labour will argue against renewing Trident in May's Holyrood elections having agreed its position last autumn.  Kezia Dugdale, Scottish Labour leader, told the BBC there had been a "healthy debate" in the party in Scotland and it now had an "honest position".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35531121	Junior doctors row: How close did they come to a deal?	Junior doctors are taking part in their second 24-hour strike on Wednesday. It comes after the latest round of talks with the government over a new contract failed to reach a deal.  Sir David Dalton, the hospital boss brought in to try to broker a deal, said there had been good progress. So how close did both sides get?  The talks undoubtedly broke down - perhaps irreparably - over payments for working on Saturday.  Ministers want daytime hours to be classed as a normal working day.  But negotiators did offer doctors a little more than they previously had. They suggested unsocial hours - for which extra premiums are paid - could start from 17:00 instead of 19:00.  However, the British Medical Association has refused to accept that Saturday should be a normal working day.  Instead, they offered to take a smaller rise in basic pay - the government has offered 11% - in return for all day Saturday to attract an unsocial hours premium.  There were a number of other issues that were not resolved.  Sources close to the talks have suggested many of those were not necessarily unresolvable, but that with the two sides so far apart on the Saturday issue there was little reason to go through the details elsewhere.  So what were they? There's a fairly wide range of issues. Some, arguably, are more important than others.  The BMA has argued in talks that doctors should get extra pay if their breaks are disrupted.  Negotiators have said breaks will be paid with doctors getting time off in lieu when breaks are interrupted.  But the union felt this did not go far enough. They said financial penalties at four times the rate of pay should be imposed on trusts when doctors don't get their full breaks. How much of this would go to the doctor remains unclear.  This, doctors, argued was because evidence shows concentration and decision-making is impaired after working continuously for many hours.  This has been a long-running issue in the dispute. The government wants to scrap the financial penalties that are in place when doctors work excessive hours.  But throughout the process, the BMA has argued this will put patient safety at risk.  Negotiators have responded by proposing a new guardian role be created to keep an eye on working hours so problems could be escalated and fines imposed if necessary.  The BMA was pleased with this, but wanted a union representative involved in the process. This has not been agreed.  Junior doctors have to spend time on-call, ready to come into work at short notice if needed. A rate of pay for when they are called in has been agreed.  But what hasn't is the amount medics should be paid for just being available.  The BMA has asked for up to 20% of the normal rate for those hours, but negotiators have offered only 10%.  On top of any unsocial hours payments at weekends, talks have covered what doctors should get on top for working regular weekends.  The government team has offered an extra 33% for those working one in three or more Saturdays.  But the BMA wanted frequent working to be more generously defined, albeit it at a lower rate.  It asked for 10% for those working one in three or more weekends and 5% for those working one in four or one in five.	health

The extent of the intelligence agencies' computer and internet spying operation has recently become clear.  The draft Investigatory Powers Bill is meant to put it on a firm legal footing.  But the Intelligence and Security Committee says the bill lacks clarity and is a "missed opportunity".  "Given the background to the draft Bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people's privacy - which is enshrined in other legislation - does not feature more prominently," says the committee's report.  "One might have expected an overarching statement at the forefront of the legislation, or to find universal privacy protections applied consistently throughout the draft Bill.  "However, instead, the reader has to search and analyse each investigatory power individually to understand the privacy protections which may apply.  "This results in a lack of clarity which undermines the importance of the safeguards associated with these powers."  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, said: "We have therefore recommended that the new legislation contains an entirely new part dedicated to overarching privacy protections, which should form the backbone of the draft legislation around which the exceptional powers are then built. This will ensure that privacy is an integral part of the legislation rather than an add-on."  Mr Grieve added: "The draft bill appears to have suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation."  The Home Office is due to publish a final, amended version of the bill later this year.  The draft bill, which is one of the longest pieces of legislation to be considered by MPs in recent years, would force internet service providers to store web browsing records of everyone in the UK for a year.  This is meant to help the police and security services keep pace with technology being used by terrorists and organised criminals.  But security chiefs told the ISC, a cross-party committee of MPs and peers, that they already "have a range of other capabilities which enable them to obtain equivalent data" so this part of the bill will mainly be used by the police.  The ISC wants to restrict the scope of proposed "equipment interference" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.  Given that the "targeted" warrants could cover "a target as broad as an entire hostile foreign intelligence service" it is not clear why "bulk" warrants are also included in the bill, the committee says.  The committee is also concerned about the downloading of large databases, which might include medical or bank records, known as bulk personal data sets, to aid investigations.  Dominic Grieve said: "Given that each Bulk Personal Dataset potentially contains personal information about a large number of individuals - the majority of whom will not be of any interest to the agencies - the committee considers that each dataset is sufficiently intrusive that it should require a specific warrant.  "We therefore recommend that Class Bulk Personal Dataset warrants are removed from the legislation."  The draft bill allows the security services to hold - but not use - bulk personal data sets for a temporary period without a warrant in certain circumstances.  This could happen, the report says, when the data has been acquired "opportunistically," without the time to apply for a warrant, but it means the agencies could hold the data without authorisation indefinitely which was clearly "not appropriate".  The committee is also calling for more clarity about the privacy safeguards to be applied to the examination of material gathered by the trawling of internet traffic passing through the UK, a practice revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The draft bill is being scrutinised by a joint parliamentary committee which is due to report on Thursday.  The ISC, which took evidence in private from Home Secretary Theresa May and the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, has confined its scrutiny to the parts of the bill that relate to secret intelligence material, which other committees cannot see.  Sir Francis Richards, a former head of GCHQ, said said the agencies already had most of the powers they needed but the bill was needed to increase transparency and public confidence in a "post-Snowden" world.  "The old legislation was designed to be obscure because there was not supposed to be any public understanding of the agencies' techniques," he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.  There was now a need to "put the record straight" but the draft bill, in his view, struck the right balance between security and privacy.  The ISC report was welcomed by civil liberties campaigners.  Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: "Rushing through legislation has to stop. It's time for a proper debate about whether bulk surveillance powers are acceptable in a democracy like the UK."	politics

The Independent Commission, chaired by ex-NHS chief executive Lord Crisp, said some cases were potentially dangerous.  Some 500 patients travel more than 50km (31 miles) to access care each month - as acute inpatient beds or services are unavailable in their areas, it said.  The government has asked the NHS to cut unnecessary out-of-area treatments.  The report, which is backed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), recommends changes to how services are commissioned.  It says that, from October 2017, no acutely ill patient should have to travel long distances to receive care.  At the same time, a maximum four-hour wait for acute psychiatric care - in hospital or the community after an initial assessment - should be introduced, it says.  The aim is to guarantee that patients with mental health problems are treated equally to those with physical problems.  President of the RCP, Prof Sir Simon Wessely, said: "Everyone agrees that it is a scandal that patients with serious mental disorders who need admission can end up being sent anywhere from Cornwall to Cumbria in a search for a bed. And yet it continues.  "The answers lie not in just providing more beds, although there are definitely places where that might help in the short term, but assessing the entire system."  The report, led by former chief executive of NHS England, Lord Nigel Crisp, said access to acute care for severely ill adult mental health patients was inadequate nationally and, in some cases, potentially dangerous.  The most common problem, it said, was difficulty in finding a bed for a patient in need - and the problem that posed to patients and the public if someone needing inpatient care was not admitted.  The declining bed numbers along with increased demand had made the situation worse, it said.  The Commission said crisis bed management was a daily occurrence in some trusts, with staff trying to free up beds by moving patients from ward to ward, sending them home on leave, or discharging them earlier than planned.  Other patients were asked to travel "unacceptably long distances" to find a bed, it said.  Minister for Mental Health, Alistair Burt, said the report would help to shape planned changes to build a better mental health service.  "NHS England will soon be publishing its independent Mental Health Taskforce report, backed by the £1bn investment announced by the prime minister earlier this year."  Mental health charities said more investment was long overdue.  Brian Dow of Rethink Mental Illness said: "Unfortunately continuous cuts to mental health care funding have left too many services pushed to breaking point.  In 2013/14, 1.7 million people in England used mental health services, with 105,270 admitted to hospital.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35526160	Whitehall urged to tighten hospitality rules for officials	Government departments have been urged to be "more stringent" over accepting corporate hospitality and gifts.  A National Audit Office review found officials were justified in accepting most offers but some were questionable in terms of relevance and frequency.  Tickets to sporting events, bottles of champagne and iPads accepted by senior officials may not have been consistent with official guidelines, it said.  The Cabinet Office said the clear principles in place were working well.  Under the guidelines, officials are only supposed to attend functions and accept gifts when they are in the interests of government, and the offer is proportionate without presenting any conflict of interest.  The spending watchdog examined how rules on acceptance and disclosure of corporate hospitality had worked across Whitehall between 2012 and 2015, focusing in particular on three departments: the Department for Business (BIS), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Defence, Equipment and Support (DE&S) arm of the Ministry of Defence.  It found that senior officials accepted gifts and hospitality on 3,413 occasions over the period, from nearly 1,500 different organisations. The Department for Business accounted for the most (718), while the Department for International Development (20) had the fewest instances.  While lunches and dinners accounted for more than 60% of hospitality, only 40 gifts were reported over the period.  In 2014-2015, the 200 most senior officials in Whitehall accepted an estimated £29,000 in overall hospitality, with BIS officials accounting for the most, an estimated £7,170. Over the same period, it is estimated that BIS officials as a whole accepted £35,000 worth of hospitality and gifts, compared with £100,000 at DE&S and £19,000 at HMRC.  The watchdog said most of these were routine sandwich lunches, dinners and drinks receptions which were "reasonable" for officials to attend and in line with government business.  But it said there were exceptions, with officials accepting tickets to football matches, including the FA Cup semi-final, tennis games at Wimbledon, movie premieres and pop concerts. In some cases, officials were also accompanied by their spouses or their children.  Gifts accepted that were deemed to be disproportionate, in terms of their value, included a hamper from Fortnum and Mason, a £300 painting and a £300 Mont Blanc pen, although the latter was surrendered to officials.  Some officials at DE&S were also deemed to have overstepped the mark in terms of the frequency with which they accepted hospitality from defence companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group.  Although there was no evidence of hospitality or gifts causing a conflict of interest, the watchdog said meetings with firms such as Deloitte or PwC, that provide services to government, risked a perception of conflict.  It also questioned the decision of officials to accept hospitality from the British Bankers Association when some of its members were subject to regulatory and criminal investigations.  "Public officials are sometimes offered gifts and hospitality by external stakeholders which it is reasonable for them to accept," said Amyas Morse, the NAO's director general. "This can however, undermine value for money or affect government's reputation.  "While most, but not all cases, declared by officials appear on the face of it to be justifiable in the normal course of business, we found some weakness in the oversight and control of gifts and hospitality. This needs to be addressed by the Cabinet Office and departments."  Details of hospitality and gifts accepted by senior civil servants were first made public in 2009. Departments are required to publish registers four times a year. Twelve out of 17 departments managed to meet this quarterly target between 2012 and 2015, the watchdog said.  The Cabinet Office, which drew up the official guidelines, welcomed the report, saying it "showed that the system is working well, with offers of hospitality being recorded and properly acted upon".  "Clear and well understood principles governing the acceptance of gifts and hospitality are in place for all civil servants," a spokeswoman said.  "This government is the most transparent ever and publishes an unprecedented range of information about gifts and hospitality received by ministers, special advisers and senior civil servants."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35523024	Flashes of light may stop jet lag	Exposure to short flashes of light at night could help sleeping travellers adjust to new time zones and avoid jet lag, according to US scientists.  The light beams travel through the eyelids and this tells the brain to re-set the body's inner biological clock, the Stanford researchers believe.  They tested the method in 39 volunteers and found it shifted a person's body clock by about two hours.  An hour of the flashlight therapy was enough to achieve this effect.  People's bodies synchronise to the 24-hour pattern of daytime and night they are used to. And when they travel across time zones to a new light-dark schedule, they need to realign.  While most people can easily manage a long-haul flight across one or two time zones, crossing several time zones - there are 24 in all - messes with the body clock.  Jet lag can leave travellers tired, irritable and disorientated for days.  As a remedy, some people take melatonin tablets, which mimic a hormone released in the evening.  Some try phototherapy - light boxes that simulate daylight.  But Dr Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues at Stanford University School of Medicine believe sleeping in front of a strobe light could work better.  They asked volunteers to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day for about two weeks.  Next, they were asked to sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light and others a strobe light (two-millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, 10 seconds apart) for an hour.  The flashing-light group reported a nearly two-hour delay in the onset of sleepiness the following night.  In comparison, the delay in sleepiness was 36 minutes for the continuous-light group.  Dr Zeitzer calls his therapy "biological hacking". Cells in the back of the eye that detect the light send messages to a part of the brain that sets the body clock.  The light fools the brain into thinking the day is longer than it really is, which shifts the inner clock.  "This could be a new way of adjusting much more quickly to time changes than other methods in use today," Dr Zeitzer said.  Flashing light was particularly powerful because it gave the light-detecting cells at the back of the eye a chance to recover or recalibrate in the darkness between the flashes, he added.  Stuart Peirson, an expert in neuroscience at Oxford University, said: "It is great to see advances in this area being translated into effective treatments.  "Whilst drugs can be used to shift the clock, light is readily available and is what our bodies have evolved to respond to.  "I'm amazed that they got such a dramatic effect.  "You would normally have to sit in front of a light box for several hours to get an effect.  "The idea underlying this is certainly based on solid biology."	health

The British Social Attitudes Survey has been tracking satisfaction since 1983.  The 2015 poll of nearly 2,200 people showed satisfaction with the NHS at 60% - down from a peak of 70% in 2010.  Some 23% said they were actively dissatisfied - a rise of eight percentage points on the year before and the biggest single jump in a year.  Waiting times were cited as the biggest reason for dissatisfaction - mentioned by over half of people - followed by there being not enough staff.  The findings come amid growing pressure on waiting times for cancer care, A&E and routine operations, such as knee and hip operations.  Patients reported highest satisfaction rates for GP services and lowest for social care, which is run by local authorities and covers home help for tasks such as washing and dressing, and care homes.  The survey - carried out by NatCen Social Research - covered Scotland, Wales and England. The differences between the three nations were not considered to be statistically significant.  Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund think-tank, said that while overall satisfaction levels were still high by historical standards, the findings should act as a "real wake up call".  "What's gone wrong is the public's perception of the NHS under growing pressure. Money is tight, waiting times are getting longer, people are concerned that when they need the NHS it might not be there for them."  Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, agreed the public needed reassurance about the future of the NHS.  But he said the "most important set of results" were on social care. He said the satisfaction levels were "deeply concerning" and said the system needed greater funding.  A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said: "There is pressure on the NHS as our population ages, and that's why the government is investing record amounts to transform care."  A Welsh government spokesman said it too was increasing the budget, and ministers were working hard to "improve patient care".	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35525373	Heathrow: Minister 'hopes' for decision by end of July	The Transport Secretary has said he "very much hopes" a decision on where to build a new runway in southern England will be taken by late July.  He also denied the delay in making the decision had anything to do with May's London mayoral election - where the anti-Heathrow expansion Zac Goldsmith is standing for the Conservatives.  Mr McLoughlin insisted the delay was based on environmental concerns.  Last year, the Davies Commission, looking at how to increase airport capacity in the south east of England, recommended the building of a third runway at Heathrow rather than a second one at Gatwick.  But Conservative MP for Richmond Park and North Kensington, and candidate for London Mayor, Zac Goldsmith has long pledged to resign as an MP and force a by-election if the Conservatives decided to go ahead with the airport's enlargement.  Asked by Transport Committee chair, Louise Ellman whether the delay in making a decision on where to build a new runway had anything to do with the mayoral election in May, Mr McLoughlin said: "We knew when the mayoral election was going to be when we said we hoped to take a decision, when we hoped to take a decision.  "So I think to somehow now say the only reason we're not taking a decision is because of the mayoral election is not really credible. But I know that's what some people want to interpret on that."  The transport secretary said it was in fact Sir Howard Davies' own evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee late last year that caused the government to postpone its decision on where to build the runway.  Mr McLoughlin said Sir Howard's evidence to the Committee on environmental impact was "an issue" and did cause the government "to pause".  He added that the mayoral election and potential referendum on the UK's membership of the EU could impact on the timing of any announcement on airport expansion but that he "very much hoped" the decision would be made before the Summer recess at the end of July.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35523020	Safety recall of St John's Wort tablets	Packets of St John's Wort tablets are being recalled in the UK as a safety precaution after six batches have been found to be contaminated with a toxin.  Produced in 2013, the affected batches of the herbal remedy are due to expire between May and August 2016.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is asking consumers to check their medicine cabinets.  If you have one of these packs do not take the tablets as they could potentially cause harm.  The contamination is likely to be from accidental collection of local weeds during harvesting, says the MHRA.  The tablets affected have levels of a toxic compound called pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) above the threshold recommended by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products.  PAs are known to cause liver problems in humans. Symptoms of liver disorders include yellowing of the whites of the eyes and/or skin, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, abdominal pain and unusual tiredness. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms you should tell your doctor straight away.  Gerald Heddell, Director of Inspection, Enforcement and Standards Division at MHRA, said: "If you have any questions, speak to your GP, pharmacist, or other healthcare professional. Any suspected side effects can be reported to MHRA through our safety monitoring system, the Yellow Card Scheme."	health

Amid all the claim and counterclaim about anti-social-hours payments, on-call duties and long working days, it's easy to get bogged down in the detail of the junior doctors dispute.  But as we prepare for the second strike by medics in England in the contract row on Wednesday, it's worth stopping for a moment to ask why this row matters.  Of course, how much doctors get paid for working weekends is clearly important to them - and, as taxpayers, the rest of us. And if the quality of care at weekends improves as a result of this contract, as the government argues it will, it goes without saying that matters too.  But there is another element to this dispute, which is arguably much more fundamental than either of these issues: it's about the changing nature of healthcare - and how we respond to it.  Since the health service was created in the aftermath of World War Two, it has gone from a service where patients either died or were cured of their illness to one where people are surviving but having to sometimes live with debilitating conditions.  It's a success story in many ways. We are now surviving heart attacks, strokes and cancer in a way that would have been unimaginable when the NHS was formed in 1948.  But that has brought with it challenges. There are about 15 million people living with what are classed as chronic illnesses such as dementia, heart disease and diabetes - for which there is no cure. Many of these people are elderly and need careful support and care.  It has meant that hospitals are now full of incredibly sick and frail patients who would simply not have been alive 20, perhaps even 10 years ago. One in four hospital beds is occupied by dementia patients, for example.  That means the lives of junior doctors are very different to what they were in previous generations.  More is being asked of them in terms of dealing with large numbers of ill patients. One medic told me how at weekends she could regularly be in charge of 80 really sick patients - all of whom ideally need huge amounts of care and support. The doctors feel run ragged and undervalued.  It is this that is clearly contributing to the "high level of discontent" in the workforce referred to by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in to negotiate with the British Medical Association, in his letter to ministers after the latest breakdown of talks.  But this isn't just unique to junior doctors. A similar theme has emerged in general practice where last week we heard that many GPs feel they can no longer provide adequate care to their patients, while demands from care homes meant there needed to be a complete re-think of how their residents are cared for.  This is because as hospitals have had to cope with more and more really sick patients, a lot of the care that was once done there has been pushed out into the community. GPs now run asthma clinics, provide diabetes care and even carry out minor operations, while dealing with patients who are living with a range of different illnesses.  Now a lot of people may say, 'So what? There are lots of different jobs where people could argue more and more is being asked of them too. What makes being a doctor so special?' The simple answer - and it is one the profession puts time and time again - is that the work they do affects people in a much more profound way than other professions. What, after all, could be more fundamental than an individual's health?  And so, even when this dispute is over, we will still be left with an even more intractable problem.	health

The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps) said there were 51,140 surgical procedures last year - up from 45,406 the year before.  It overturns a recent decline, which was blamed on the recession and the scandal over faulty breast implants.  Nine out of 10 procedures were in women, although the rise was seen in both genders.  Overall, the number of procedures increased by 13%.  Consultant plastic surgeon and Baaps council member Ash Mosahebi said many reasons were contributing to the increase.  He told the BBC: "I think partly because the economy is improving and people are spending more on luxury items.  "And social media is becoming more popular, people are sending pictures of themselves frequently and want to look good.  "And I would say the Botox generation who got older using Botox and fillers, those things are not working any more for those age groups so they're taking the next step up and that is surgical options."  However, he said people were more educated about cosmetic surgery after thousands of women were fitted with substandard breast implants made by the French firm Poly Implant Prothese.  "I have patients asking, 'What are you using?' and that's a good thing to have come out of that."	health

Subsidised rents for households earning more than £30,000, or £40,000 in London, will be scrapped in April 2017.  Social housing tenants will be asked to pay rent at or near market rates.  Ministers say it "better reflects people's ability to pay" - but Labour and the Local Government Association say it would hit hard-working families.  The department for communities and local government argues that is "not fair that hard-working people are subsidising the lifestyles of those on higher than average incomes, to the tune of £3,500 per year".  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said people who could afford to pay more in rent "should do so" - but it would be graded, so that those on lower incomes would not have to pay full market rates.  "We have always said we would consider carefully how much more people pay as they move through the pay scales, once they get over £30,000," he told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.  He said the government would "listen to what comes in before we make a final decision in the period ahead of us".  According to the LGA-commissioned study, almost 60,000 households in England will not be able to afford to pay rents at the market rate or take advantage of the right to buy.  Councillor Peter Box, housing spokesman at the LGA, which represents hundreds of local councils in England, said: "Many social housing tenants across the country will be unable to afford market rents or take up the offer to buy their council home under this policy.  "A couple with three children, earning £15,000 each a year, cannot be defined as high income. Pay to stay needs to be voluntary for councils - as it will be for housing associations.  "This flexibility is essential to allow us to protect social housing tenants and avoid the unintended consequence of hard-working families being penalised, people being disincentivised to work and earn more and key workers, such as nurses, teachers or social workers, having to move out of their local area."  The LGA figures, compiled by the estate agent Savills, show that almost 215,000 social housing tenants will be affected by the "pay to stay" policy.  The policy is expected to save £245m a year by 2019-20, ending a situation where higher-income social tenants benefit from taxpayer-funded subsidies of up to £3,500 per year.  Former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, now a crossbench peer, will attempt to amend the housing bill, which is being scrutinised next week in the House of Lords, to place the scheme at the discretion of local authorities.  The peer, who is now chairman of the Peabody Trust housing association, has warned that the proposals were part of a package that could "threaten the future of social housing".  He told The Observer: "When this was originally discussed in the coalition government, it was intended to deal with the very small number of high earners on over £60,000.  "The current proposals will affect a lot more households with earnings of half that."  Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: "This new research backs Labour's concerns that this Tory 'tenant tax' could force thousands of working families from their homes.  "As the Housing and Planning Bill is debated in the House of Lords over the coming weeks, ministers should take a hard look at the effect their plans will have and use this opportunity to think again."

Treasury Select Committee MPs raised concerns that banks fined millions for wrongdoing may be exploiting loopholes and "unclear" rules to pay less tax.  It is important taxpayers do not "bear the burden", committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told the chancellor in a letter.  The Treasury said it would respond to the letter in due course.  Under UK law, banks are not allowed to log fines they are forced to pay for mis-selling and other misconduct as a cost in order to reduce their profits and, in turn, the amount of tax they pay.  There are also tight restrictions about off setting compensation payments to customers against tax.  However, Mr Tyrie said it appeared in some circumstances banks were able to claim fines they paid to the regulator were tax deductable.  He called on Mr Osborne to confirm this was not allowed, as there appeared to be "some doubt" about the rules.  In the early 1990s some firms had been deducting from their tax bill - i.e. treating as a legitimate expense - protection money paid to the Provisional IRA. The then Prime Minister John Major intervened and banned the practice. But there still remains no clarity on the issues of what can and cannot be deducted.  HMRC has issued guidance on the matter but, as you can see, the section under fines imposed by regulators still says (words to the effect of) on the one hand you can but on the other you cannot.  Even for tax experts, the question of whether mis-selling or fines imposed by the government or independent watchdogs can be considered a legitimate cost of business is unclear.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation has called for clarity from the government, which is exactly what the Treasury Select Committee also hopes to get in its letter to the chancellor today.  Mr Tyrie said it was "not just appropriate, but essential" that fines were not tax deductable.  "It is important that taxpayers are not required to to bear any part of the burden of any payment import by the FCA or overseas regulators. The bill should be picked up by the bank's shoulders."  If banks were "not happy about it", they had a number of possible remedies, including controlling employees salaries and bonuses, he said.  He also raised concerns that settlements reached with foreign governments were sometimes structured in a way that allowed payment to be offset against British tax.  He did not know whether this suggestion was well-founded, but if it was true it would be "alarming", he said.  In recent years, banks including HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Clydesdale Bank have been fined by the FCA over misconduct.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35515408	EU referendum: PM accused of 'disrespect' to activists	Dozens of Tory members have accused David Cameron of showing disrespect to the party's grassroots after he told MPs to disregard their views on Europe.  In a letter to the Sunday Telegraph, the signatories from more than 40 Conservative associations said their opinions should be heard.  They said it was "deeply regrettable" that the PM had dismissed their views.  Downing Street told the newspaper that the prime minister had the "greatest of respect for Conservative associations".  "He was simply making the point that everyone should ultimately vote with their conscience," a spokesman said.  An in-out referendum on EU membership has been promised by the end of 2017, although it is widely expected to be at the end of June, if Mr Cameron can secure agreement to his reform proposals at the next summit of EU leaders on 18 February.  The PM said last week that MPs should not vote based on what their constituency association might say, and instead vote with their heart.  However, the associations' letter said: "It was through the dedication and hard work of Conservative Party members that David Cameron secured the majority he needed to form a government...  "It is deeply regrettable that the prime minister dismisses the very people who helped secure his victory, and he should remember that no prime minister has a divine right to rule."  In the letter they urged Mr Cameron to "accept that loyal Conservative Party members want the opportunity for a balanced debate".  Among the signatories are Ed Costelloe, chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, Matt Ewert of the South Staffordshire Conservative Association, Tony Partridge of the Clwyd South Conservative Association and Geoffrey Vero of the Surrey Heath Conservative Constituency Association.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said local Tory associations "care passionately about their local ability to make decisions" but the PM had stressed everyone would have their say at the referendum.  The letter comes amid continued speculation about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU when Mr Cameron announces the date of the referendum.  Home Secretary Theresa May is thought to have ruled herself out, and Mr Cameron is hoping to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to back him.  A spokesman for Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he "supports the prime minister's strategy to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union" and it would be "premature" to make a judgement before the deal is concluded.  A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he would "make his views known when he's seen the final deal".  A spokesman for Employment Minister Priti Patel, who has been at the centre of press speculation that she will lead the exit campaign, said she had "always said she would make a judgement once we've seen the final deal".  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it "would be wonderful" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it needs and welcomes anyone who wants to join it.  He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying there were fundamental differences on tactics.  The UKIP MP said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on "identity and immigration," while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an "optimistic, upbeat internationalist message".  A third group, Grassroots Out, which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign.  Lib Dem Leader Tim Farron, who wants Britain to remain in the EU, said both the leave campaigners and the prime minister were failing to concentrate on the "big questions" that people would be thinking about when they voted in the referendum.	politics

Mr Hunt said the BMA was behaving in a "totally irresponsible way" and accused the union of "spreading misinformation".

The aim is to create a paperless service that would be more convenient for patients, and help doctors to provide faster diagnoses.  More than £4bn has been set aside for areas such as electronic records and online appointments, prescriptions and consultations.  But Labour said the NHS was "going backwards" under the Conservatives.  Full details of the funding are being agreed between the Department of Health and NHS England, but are expected to include:  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said doctors found filling out paperwork and bureaucracy "so frustrating".  "We know that proper investment in IT - it's not without its pitfalls - can save time for doctors and nurses and means they can spend more time with patients," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.  The aim is to allow patients to book services and order prescriptions online, access apps and digital tools and choose to speak to their doctor online or via a video link.  Examples of NHS-accredited apps include one developed by young people to help prevent self-harm, and another that can help care home workers identify the early signs of dementia among residents.  Through the funding, everyone will have access to their own electronic health record, which will be shared between professionals so patients will no longer have to repeat their medical history.  Patients will also be given the opportunity to upload and send real-time data to medical professionals on long-term conditions such as blood pressure.  By 2020, it is hoped that a quarter of patients with long-term conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer will be able to monitor their health remotely.  The government wants at least 10% of patients to use computers, tablets or smartphones to access GP services by March 2017.  At the end of last year, Mr Hunt said free wi-fi would be provided in all NHS buildings in England but a deadline has still not been set.  Previous efforts by other governments to modernise NHS technology have been fraught with difficulty.  Labour tried to launch electronic medical records in 2002. Described as "the world's biggest civil information technology programme", the effort was scrapped after at least £10bn was spent.  Under the previous coalition government, Mr Hunt announced the NHS would go paperless by 2018.  BBC health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson said progress had been slow and this latest announcement was another attempt to push the NHS forward.  Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said: "Rather than rehashing old announcements, Jeremy Hunt needs to be telling the public how he intends to sort out the crisis facing our NHS.  "The Tories cannot hide from the fact that the NHS is going backwards on their watch.  "Hospital departments have become dangerously full, patients are waiting hours in A&E, and the health service is facing the worst financial crisis in a generation."	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35491177	The challenge of saving lives with 'big data'	Every day, more data about our lives is being generated than ever before. When it comes to saving lives, the bigger the data the better - but what to do with it all?  Ninety per cent of the data in the world has been created in the past two years alone, experts estimate - and the reason for that is technological innovation.  The internet, mobile phones, cameras, sensors, bank cards and social media are just some of the items responsible for the massive volume of "big data" that is currently amassed every single second.  As technology has advanced, so too have the opportunities for scientists.  Sequencing a human genome - all three billion letters of it, which denotes an individual's unique DNA sequence - used to take years to achieve. Now it takes less than a week.  The information this provides is improving scientists' understanding of the genetic basis of many human diseases.  And large-scale projects such as the 100,000 Genomes Project are starting to give some families a diagnosis for their children's mystery conditions.  The more genomes are analysed, the greater the hope of new and more effective treatments for rare diseases.  Genomes are just one element of the move to capture more and more 'big data' in medicine and healthcare.  Take the humble patient record held by GPs.  There are around 60 million of them in the UK.  When combined with hospital data on everything from why people are admitted, to their scans, X-rays and pathology results, electronic patient records are a very valuable resource.  Prof Harry Hemingway, professor of clinical epidemiology and director of the Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, is harnessing that data for the benefit of patients and the public.  Put simply, he wants to improve people's health and the quality of their healthcare by analysing all kinds of anonymised information.  By linking up data from primary and secondary care, for example, he says it is possible to "identify the crucial time course of disease".  In the UK, too many cancers are diagnosed at a late stage when the disease is often advanced and untreatable.  But if those patients have been to their GP with symptoms which have not been picked up, then that information can be used to diagnose other patients earlier.  It is a similar story with cardiovascular disease - one of the world's major killers - and ovarian cancer, which is notoriously difficult to spot.  "We can use data and computers to look at all the symptoms and identify markers of these diseases," Prof Hemingway says.  "We have a powerful set of opportunities to make advances across the whole of health and biomedicine."  Prof Hemingway's concern is that unnecessary harm and death is occurring too often in the UK because data has not been analysed.  "We expect data to be optimised in all other aspects of life - so why not in healthcare? You can't have a programme to improve the effectiveness of medicines without data."  So, 'big data' has the power to answer lots of questions - but is it always clear what to ask?  Prof Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, says the challenge is "how to make sense of it".  He is helping to analyse data from the UK Biobank, a project which started in 2006 and which has recruited half a million people aged 40 to 69 from across the country.  They have all provided blood, urine and saliva samples for future analysis, and given detailed information about their bodies, diets and lifestyles - and everyone will be followed up regularly until the day they die.  Recently, large groups of the participants have undergone cognitive function tests, others have gone through genotyping - determining differences in a person's genetic make-up - and yet more have had images taken of their brains.  The idea is that the data collected will help scientists discover why some people develop particular diseases and others do not.  But that is not an easy task.  Prof Landray says: "You can't just sit a radiologist down in front of thousands of MRI scans to analyse. You have to simplify it down and then make it accessible for researchers to look at."  Sometimes it is possible to compare like with like, but more often the data has holes in it and is much more messy.  As part of the soon-to-be-opened Big Data Institute in Oxford, more than 500 scientists will take up the challenge of handling the Biobank data and analysing it.  Before, researchers were full of questions they wanted to ask about human health - but had to wait years to find out the answers.  "They now have the opportunity to ask those questions in rapid time," Prof Landray says.  And big is definitely beautiful when it comes to this kind of data.  Research based on small numbers of patients contains too many errors, particularly when it comes to analysing the risk factors for diseases.  "We crave information about large numbers of people over long periods," he says. "That way, you get rid of the play of chance."  Around the world the race is on to use data to save lives.  In the US, President Obama recently launched a Precision Medicine Initiative which plans to gather "big data" to develop more individualised care.  In China, a study of 500,000 people is doing something similar which means it will be possible to compare and contrast the health of entire populations in the not too distant future.  "Big data" should keep health experts busy for a long time to come.	health

From May, charities and organisations will no longer be allowed to spend taxpayers' money on lobbying ministers.  The Cabinet Office said the new clause in grants would mean funds go to good causes, not political campaigns.  Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said it was an "insane policy" that would not work in reality.  "Take a service charity funded to run a helpline. They may well be dealing with ex-servicemen, there will be policy issues that emerge from that. They're not allowed to tell the government?" he told the BBC.  "The other reason is, if you've got mixed funding, how are you going to know which is the government's and somebody else's?"  The "draconian" move was "tantamount to making charities take a vow of silence", he added.  Under the new conditions , which only apply to grants from central UK government departments, organisations will not be able to use grants for "activity intended to influence - or attempt to influence - Parliament, government or political parties".  However charities will still be able to use privately-raised funds to campaign as they like.  Christopher Snowden, from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a right-of-centre think tank, agrees with the changes.  "It's not about silencing charities, it's not about stopping charities - whether they get public money or not - from speaking out, of course they should do, it's very important that they campaign and lobby for the things that are important to them," he told the BBC.  "It's specifically about the money that they get from government and how that is spent."  Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock said: "Taxpayers' money must be spent on improving people's lives and spreading opportunities, not wasted on the farce of government lobbying government.  "These common sense rules will protect freedom of speech - but taxpayers won't be made to foot the bill for political campaigning and political lobbying.  However, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons Health Select Committee, posted on Twitter: "Ending charities ability to lobby ministers wld have serious consequences for #publichealth Balance already distorted in favour of industry."  According to a House of Commons briefing, the estimated total income of the UK voluntary sector (not including charities) in 2012-13 was £40bn, of which £13bn came from government grants.  The Cabinet Office said UK government departments gave the voluntary sector just under £10bn in grants last year.  BBC political reporter Alan Soady said exactly how the new rules would be enforced - and how charities would prove which pots of money funding for lobbying came from - was still unanswered.  There was also some concern in Whitehall that some charities seemed to have been set up primarily to lobby, or that they were straying from their brief on the issues they lobbied on, he said.  The move follows research by the IEA into so-called "sock puppets", where taxpayers' money is given to pressure groups which then campaign for policy changes or extra money.  Former Bishop of Oxford Lord Harries, who chairs a commission which has looked into charity lobbying - the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement - said the "polarisation" between charities' direct work and policies they wanted to change was "very, very unhelpful".  Charities on the "front line" could often best identify where government policy was failing, and "surely they are morally bound to tell the government they could improve their work to help, say, children in poverty?" he said.  The system has been trialled in grants provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government.  Ministers insisted it had not curtailed the ability of charities such as Shelter from lobbying on housing legislation.	politics

Privatisation of services has made them less accountable, the Labour leader told a conference in Nottingham.  He said English councils should have similar powers to cities on the continent, where local authorities have control of water and energy services.  A Conservative spokesman said such a move would "hurt working people".  Mr Corbyn's support for public ownership and anti-austerity message are at the centre of Labour's campaign for May's local elections in England.  He told the Association of Labour Councillors conference he wants councils to become "public entrepreneurs" with greater freedom to spend taxpayers' money and to borrow to fund investment and public services.  Mr Corbyn, who has already set out plans to take the railways back into public ownership, said he would back local authorities to take control of utilities and other services in their area.  "Privatisation isn't just about who runs a service, it's about who services are accountable to," he said.  "It's about who shares the rewards, about protecting the workforce and getting a good deal for local people who use the services.  "After a generation of forced privatisation and outsourcing of public services, the evidence has built up that handing services over to private companies routinely delivers poorer quality, higher cost, worse terms and conditions for the workforce, less transparency and less say for the public.  "We will give councils greater freedoms to roll back the tide of forced privatisation.  "It locks people out of decision-making, makes services less accountable, too often means a bad deal for taxpayers, a bad deal for communities and a bad deal for those that work in the services too."  A Conservative spokesman said: "This is another example of how the Labour Party will hurt working people by racking up more debt and increasing taxes to pay for it - driving up the cost of living for working families.  "That's why Labour are a threat to our economic security and every working family's security. The Conservatives will continue to deliver stability, security and opportunity for working people."  Mr Corbyn also said that remaining in the European Union was in the best interests of the British people.  However, he said he wants to see further reforms in Brussels, including stronger workers' rights and an end to the pressure to privatise public services.  The speech comes as it emerged a Muslim women's group has written to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.  Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into "systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors".  Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.	politics

Healthcare professionals will be trained to understand how to treat FGM's psychological impact, the government said.  FGM refers to any procedure that alters or injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.  The news comes on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM.  The Department of Health has been working alongside survivor groups and charities to understand mental health implications.  Online training tools and guidance for NHS healthcare professionals will be developed, with advice on the specific mental health needs of women affected.  The announcement aims to ensure NHS staff in England are better equipped to deal with the long-term effects of the practice, which is also known as female circumcision.  Public Health minister Jane Ellison said: "I think it's the next obvious step in how we support girls and women who've been through FGM.  "We've made a lot of progress on the physical side of things but what really comes through from the conversations that you have with people who've been through FGM, is that the trauma can stay with them for a lifetime."  Doctors, nurses, midwives and teachers in England and Wales are legally required to report cases of FGM to the police.  The government says it is committed to ending the "abusive and illegal practice" within a generation.  A recent study estimated that about 137,000 people in England and Wales have been affected by FGM.  Between July and September last year, 1,385 cases were reported, with the highest number in London.  Christina - not her real name - is 42 and lives in west London. She was circumcised in Eritrea, east Africa, when she was six.  She was called into a room after being told her grandmother had come to visit.  "I went in and I was held down by four ladies and that's when they did it," she said.  "I was screaming for my mother but she wasn't there.  "My father didn't even know about it."  Christina has been having counselling sessions with healthcare professionals and now paints to try to help deal with the impact of the experience.  "I'd say right now, more than the physical part, it's the mental part I find difficult," she said.  "I started having flashbacks, it was a shock. It felt like it had happened now and not 36 years ago."  The Hillcrest Surgery in Ealing, west London, is one of the only practices in the UK to provide specialised support to those affected by FGM.  Deqa Dirie is a healthcare advocate at the clinic and runs discussion groups where women have a safe space to talk about their experiences.  She said: "We see people from a number of different cultural backgrounds.  "It's important for professionals to be trained so that if they come across a lady who has FGM they know the best way to help her, not just physically but mentally too."	health

Over the last few years, American Football has had to face up to the fact that repeated head collisions, which are a major feature of the sport, can have serious long-term health consequences.  But for a long time, it wasn't a popular message.  Concussion tells the story of how a young Nigerian forensic pathologist Dr Bennet Omalu discovered a progressive brain disease, which he called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, in the brain of a former National Football League player.  It looked like Alzheimer's disease, but it was present in the brain of 50-year-old Mike Webster, a professional sportsman who had died prematurely.  Fourteen years on and 150 cases of CTE have been identified, most of them in NFL players, who have experienced depression, memory loss, behavioural changes and sometimes dementia at an unusually early age.  Like retired boxers, who were once said to be "punch drunk", the common factor was multiple concussions or blows to the head over many years.  In a recent interview with the BBC, Will Smith said he had learnt a huge amount from making the film, particularly as a parent of a son who played American football.  "We watch it, we see the hits, you see players go down... and then you applaud when they come back on again five minutes later.  "Once I had the science explained to me, it becomes so obvious that you can't imagine how you didn't see it before."  Dr Julian Bailes, co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute in Illinois, is portrayed by Alex Baldwin in the film. His research helped uncover CTE and he says helmets in American football are part of the problem.  "The brain floats inside the skull and although helmets are thought to be a protection against brain trauma - they're not. In fact, helmets have probably increased the risk because players go at it harder."  In the UK, concerns over CTE have thrown the spotlight on rugby - a sport which sees its fair share of player concussions.  As the Six Nations tournament kicks off, new guidelines are offering players more protection and there is undoubtedly more awareness of the dangers of repeated head injuries and the symptoms of concussion, which does not always lead to a loss of consciousness.  However, neuroscientists admit there is still a lot of work to do to find out the scale of the problem, primarily because it is so difficult to diagnose CTE in the living.  A new research project which will track the head injuries of around 50 players at Saracens Rugby Club by looking for biomarkers in their blood, urine and saliva is an important step towards this goal. Players are being asked to wear a bio-patch device which measures the effects of a head impact.  John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, is working with the club to analyse the findings: "We need to follow players of contact sports to collect this systemic data. We need to find out why a repetitive injury in your 30s can lead to brain disease in your 50s."  His colleague Huw Morris, professor of clinical neuroscience at UCL, says scientists will then be able to look for the chemical changes that happen when a brain injury occurs.  "Anything happening in the brain is reflected in the blood after an impact, and the level of proteins reflects the damage to nerve cells.  "So, in theory, we can quantify the damage that has taken place."  The ultimate aim, they say, is to have a medical test which can be used during a game to identify when a serious head injury has taken place and when a player is fit to resume playing again.  They emphasise that the risk of CTE is low for people who have experienced a single episode of concussion. It is the dangers of repeated concussion injuries - which may or may not be picked up - that are of most concern.  But neuroscientists are not out to ban all contact sports - far from it, says Prof Hardy.  "We want people to enjoy sports as safely as we can advise them."  If a film about concussion can raise awareness of the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of letting it happen again and again, then Hollywood will have done a great service to brains and contact sports.  Concussion is released in UK cinemas on Friday 12 February.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35474095	Could John McDonnell ever be Labour leader?	I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - "Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008"); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect).  And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. "John 4 leader", it says.  I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.  Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.  He's struck "absolutely the right note" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his "rigidity".  Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is "obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago" and "didn't want to listen, didn't want to change".  Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.  As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.  The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.  The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the "prawn cocktail offensive" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.  To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes.  Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010.  I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.  Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's "easy to deal with". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.  Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.  Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading "a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us".  For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes:  Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.  I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.  So I'll put the "John 4 leader" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case.	politics

Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into "systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors".  "They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered," it told BBC Newsnight.  Labour said it had the best record of any of the parties in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates.  As Mr Corbyn prepared to speak to the Association of Labour Councillors on Saturday, BBC Newsnight spoke to about a dozen Muslim women up and down the country.  They appeared to point to a pattern of obstruction from within Labour Muslim ranks and back up Muslim Women's Network UK complaints of sabotage.  Optician Fozia Parveen claims her efforts to become a Labour councillor in Birmingham in 2008 were scuppered by men within the party.  She said: "At the time, I was aware of a smear campaign against me, they said that I was having an affair with one of the existing councillors.  "I was quite taken aback. People were turning up at my family home trying to intimidate my mum."  Ms Parveen said Muslim men told her mother to stop her from pursuing becoming a councillor.  She added: "It would be members of the local Labour Party. I didn't see them myself but my mum did say it was them."  Shazia Bashir was the first choice for Labour in a seat in Peterborough in 2007.  She claims that when her father said he would not support her, Muslim men from within the local Labour Party made her step aside. They deny the claim.  "Because I didn't have my father's consent and support, I had to step down. I was pressured into stepping down," said Ms Bashir, who was 31 and married with two children at the time.  Jean Khote, a sitting Labour councillor in Leicester, said good women candidates were barred by the membership in some areas with high Muslim populations - and that was kept from people higher up the party.  She said they would say there were not adequate candidates among the women, which she said was not true.  "There were brilliant women on the panel. I've met them and had discussions with them, they were brilliant," she added.  Newsnight was told similar stories by other women who wished to remain anonymous.  One said: "They spread this slander about me... It's the way they get to you."  Another said she was told by Labour members "Islam and feminism aren't compatible".  An advocate for gay rights was told: "This is un-Islamic. Leave that for white people."  And many spoke of being criticized for being too Westernized.  Shaista Gohir, from Muslim Women's Network UK, told Newsnight the tight-knit patriarchal communities operate a system of clan politics known as "braderi", in which votes are delivered in blocks.  "These men have a cultural mindset, which they've brought from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh," she said.  "They operate a braderi male kinship system and they've brought the system here, what I call an old boys network.  "They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered, because we will then challenge the status quo, challenge misogyny."  Muslim Women's Network UK has also written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling on him to launch an inquiry into the political participation of ethnic minority women.  But Ms Gohir said: "From our experience, Muslim women are most affected by Labour Muslim male councillors due to the latter's number in certain towns and cities."  Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.  "We have the best record of any party in selecting women and BAME [Black, Asian and minority ethnic] candidates and we will continue to do all that we can to make sure candidates are representative of the communities they seek to represent," it said.  "The Labour Party has a fair, democratic and robust procedure for selecting council candidates. Local Labour Party members select their local candidates within the party's rules and guidelines.  "Those wishing to become Labour councillors are interviewed by an independent assessment team and unsuccessful candidates have a right of appeal to the regional party board."

Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria said there was a "causal connection" between Zika, the Guillain-Barre disorder and the three deaths.  Earlier, Brazilian scientists said they had detected for the first time active samples of Zika in urine and saliva.  However, it is not clear whether the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids.  Zika, a mosquito-borne disease, has been linked to cases of babies born in Brazil with microcephaly - underdeveloped brains.  "We have confirmed and attributed three deaths to Zika," said the head of Colombia's National Health Institute, Martha Lucia Ospina.  "In this case, the three deaths were preceded by Guillain-Barre syndrome."  Guillain-Barre is a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It isn't normally fatal.  Ms Ospina said another six deaths were being investigated for possible links to Zika.  "Other cases (of deaths linked to Zika) are going to emerge," she said. "The world is realising that Zika can be deadly. The mortality rate is not very high, but it can be deadly."  Mr Gaviria said one of the fatalities took place in San Andres and the other two in Turbo, in Antioquia department.  What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread  Key unanswered questions The many things we do not know about Zika  Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do  The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect  UK virologist Prof Jonathan Ball, of the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: "We have been saying Zika has been associated with Guillain-Barre. One of the complications of that could be respiratory failure. But it is still probably a very rare event."  Although Zika usually causes mild, flu-like symptoms, it has been linked to thousands of suspected birth defects. However, it has not yet been proved that Zika causes either microcephaly or Guillain-Barre.  The main method of infection is via mosquito bites but scientists in Brazil say tests on two patients revealed Zika can be found in other body fluids.  Paulo Gadelha, the head of Brazil's Fiocruz Institute which is part of the Ministry of Health, said: "The presence of the active Zika virus has been found in saliva and urine.  "But that does not mean there is a capacity for transmission through saliva and urine."  Traces of Zika's genetic material were detected in saliva and urine during the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, but the Brazilian authorities say this is the first time "active" virus has been detected.  Oswaldo Cruz, also from Fiocruz, added: "It means the virus is active, capable of infecting a cell so this is completely different, it means that the virus is functional."  Brazil has seen 4,783 suspected cases of babies born with small brains, although only 404 of them have been confirmed, 709 have been rejected and 3,670 are still being investigated.  Meanwhile, the US has advised men to abstain from sex or use condoms after visiting affected countries, if their partner is pregnant.  The US Centers for Disease Control believes a recent case of Zika was spread through sex.  The updated advice says avoiding mosquitoes remains the best way to prevent infection, but advises men returning from affected countries to "correctly use condoms during sex or abstain from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy".  Meanwhile, the governor of Puerto Rico has declared a public health emergency over Zika. The US territory has 22 confirmed cases.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35507558	Ministers to look at further curbs on public sector pay-offs	The government is to look at more curbs on public sector redundancy payments as Chancellor George Osborne pledged to "rein in" sums paid to managers.  A consultation will look at the case for limiting payoffs to three weeks salary per year of service and reducing the amount people are entitled to when they near retirement.  The move follows a campaign by the Daily Mail against "fat cat pay-offs".  Ministers have already pledged to cap individual payoffs at £95,000.  The government says it wants to significantly reduce the cost to the taxpayer of public sector redundancy payments, which totalled about £6.5bn between 2011-12 and 2013-14.  Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mail and the Taxpayers' Alliance revealed that around 3,500 council employees across the UK earned more than £100,000 while one chief executive had an annual salary of almost £500,000.  In new guidance, the government repeated that any public servant earning just over £140,000 - which is the amount the prime minister is paid - must have their salary authorised by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.  But ministers also plan to press ahead with plans in the Conservative manifesto to cap redundancy payments at £95,000 and ban them when senior staff leave one public sector employer only to join another shortly afterwards.  In a new consultation that will last three months, the government will look at the case for setting a standard formula for calculating what exit payments public sector mangers are entitled to, according to weeks worked or money earned over a certain period.  Ministers also want to find out if there is support for preventing public sector employers offering their staff private health insurance and to taper the amount that executives can receive when they are approaching retirement.  The Treasury said it wanted to the make exit compensation "fairer, more modern and more consistent".  Mr Osborne told the Mail; "Taxpayers foot the bill for the public sector and we've been determined that we take further action. We'll rein in unfair exit payments and issue new guidance across the public sector on the highest salaries."  The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said that as the squeeze on public sector budgets continues, ministers hope this plan can simultaneously save money and be popular.  The £95,000 cap will apply, among other bodies, to the NHS, the police force, local authorities and schools.  When the consultation was launched in August, the government said that the BBC, Channel 4, Bank of England, the Armed Forces, Royal Bank of Scotland and other taxpayer-owned banks would be among organisations exempt but ministers said they would expect such bodies to introduce "their own, commensurate cap on exit payments".  Local authorities argue that retaining valued staff in senior roles doesn't come cheap.  One council said it offered some employees private health cover "to minimise absence from work due to sickness".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35501298	EU referendum: Row erupts between exit campaigns	A row has erupted between rival groups campaigning for Britain's exit from the European Union.  Vote Leave and Leave.EU are vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign when David Cameron calls a referendum.  Merger attempts appear to have been scuppered by personality clashes and differences over tactics.  Labour MP Kate Hoey has quit Vote Leave but will continue to co-chair the Labour Leave campaign.  A Labour Leave spokesman told the BBC it has now ended its affiliation to Vote Leave, an umbrella group which includes business leaders, Tory MPs and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell among others.  But Labour Leave's founder John Mills, who remains Vote Leave deputy chairman, said in a tweet that it was still affiliated to the campaign and would continue to work with all leave campaigners.  The latest bout of infighting was sparked by an internal letter leaked to The Times, by Mr Mills, a Labour donor, warning about "damaging bickering" at the top of Vote Leave.  In his letter, Mr Mills says feuding in the group had prompted the Labour MP's departure.  Ms Hoey is now supporting a third group, Grassroots Out, founded by two Conservative MPs and backed by Leave.EU, and is due to appear at a rally in Manchester later alongside UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  In his letter Mr Mills also criticises Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, who was the campaign's director, until a shake-up this week saw him moved to a non-executive role, accusing him of generating "ill-feeling".  Responding to Mr Mills' letter, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: "Vote Leave is a genuinely cross-party campaign and we value our Labour Party MPs and supporters across the country."  In a separate development. Green Party London Assembly member Dame Jenny Jones tweeted "will vote to leave #EU but cant work with an organisation with so little judgement as to put Lawson at its head," a reference to the appointment of Tory peer and climate change sceptic Lord Lawson as Vote Leave chairman.  The Electoral Commission has the task of designating the official leave and remain campaigns, which will get access to £600,000 in public funds, TV broadcasts, free mailshots and a spending limit of £7m.  The two main Leave groups differ on tactics and both are claiming to command more cross-party support - a crucial factor in getting the designation.  Arron Banks, the UKIP donor who is bankrolling Leave.EU, has written to MPs to hit back at claims by Vote Leave that it is too focused on immigration, saying it is also stressing the positive benefits of quitting the 28 nation bloc.  He also attacks Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful campaign against changing Britain's voting system in 2011's AV referendum, who also left Vote Leave's board this week for a non-executive role.  "I wouldn't put them in charge of the local sweet shop," Mr Banks says of the pair.  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "We've seen the letter and we wish him (Banks) well."  One of the founders of the Grassroots Out, or GO, campaign told BBC News the leave side of the debate "can't continue with all this bickering, there needs to be a coming together at some stage".  Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said: "It can't carry on as we are. We need to focus on winning the referendum."  He refused to say whether or not his group would be trying to win the official designation, but added: "If we're in a position where we can bring people together at the top then that's something we will look at. We've shown we can do that at grassroots."  Speaking on his regular LBC radio phone-in, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he had tried to get the two campaigns to merge, but claims Vote Leave, which he describes as a "Tory front", "refuse to work with anybody".  In a message to all UKIP members and supporters, Mr Farage said the party was now officially behind Grassroots Out.  "With the unanimous support of our MEPs we now commit to supporting Grassroots Out and want our branches and members to join with GO as a means of working with activists from other parties and none."  He added: "So let us organise and mobilise our people's army around the GO banner for this referendum."  The row has been seized on by the pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, which claims the out campaign has "descended into an all-out farce".  But exit campaigners say that group faces splits of its own, as the Scottish National Party will be running its own campaign and will not share a platform with David Cameron or other Conservatives arguing for Britain to stay in the EU.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35505843	the short, the medium and the long term	Taking a view on the health of NHS finances in England depends on what time frame you are looking at. Short term there are intense pressures, further ahead things might get easier while in the long term there are considerable uncertainties.  Swirling around Whitehall are rumours that the Department of Health's spending limit for the current financial year may be breached.  The 2015/16 year will come to an end in under two months time, but its understood to be touch and go as to whether the funds already allocated by the Treasury will keep the show on the road.  In the last financial year the department staggered over the line with a surplus of just £1m on spending of more than £100bn, equivalent to pennies after the bills have been paid from a monthly salary cheque.  The outcome this year is highly uncertain not least because the flow of extra patients into hospitals has continued to outstrip the increase in NHS budgets.  Hospital trust budgets have ballooned with little evidence of surpluses elsewhere in the system to balance this red ink.  The Department of Health can always turn to the Treasury for more money, but this would have to be voted on in parliament, leaving the government open to accusations from Labour that it had lost control of the public finances.  Serious questions would be asked of ministers and civil servants by the National Audit Office.  One government source acknowledged that things were "very very tight" with health finances.  There seems, though, to be an expectation that the department will just about make it to the end of the financial year on March 31st without the need to extend a begging bowl to the Treasury. But that still means weeks of sleepless nights for Whitehall mandarins.  Looking beyond March, the government believes that the picture gets rosier. Ministers argue that the £3.8bn above inflation boost for the NHS in England next year will give the whole system more breathing space.  They argue that hospitals will get the funding they need as long as they focus on tackling the underlying causes of their deficits.  Longer term, the big question is whether the £22bn of efficiency savings pledged by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, for 2020 can be achieved.  Lord Carter's report sets out in some detail how £5bn of that might be delivered.  Special report page: For the latest news, analysis and video  Winter across the UK: A guide to how the NHS is coping  Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure  Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt  He describes how variations across different trusts on spending practices and policies could be ironed out resulting in significant savings. He also notes that some hospitals are amongst the safest and most efficient in the world.  But that still leaves another £17bn of savings, and there is little detail on that beyond hopes that prevention and community care initiatives will keep patients out of hospital.  Back to the short term - and Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund, had a blunt assessment in The Times on Friday where he said the NHS was facing "the biggest financial crisis in its history".  He argues that the high costs of a greater focus on patient safety , including agency staff bills, have left many hospitals unable to balance their books.  Ministers believe that there is fair weather on the horizon for the NHS with higher funding pledged by the government in return for promises to get better value for those resources.  Right now, though, they will be looking only a little way ahead with financial storm clouds closing in.	health

The finding does not mean the virus can be readily transmitted through these bodily fluids.  Meanwhile, the US has advised men to abstain from sex or use condoms after visiting affected countries, if their partner is pregnant.  While Zika infection is normally mild, the infection has been linked to thousands of suspected birth defects.  The US Centers for Disease Control believes a recent case of Zika was spread through sex.  Its updated advice says avoiding mosquitoes remains the best way to prevent infection, but advises men returning from affected countries to "correctly use condoms during sex or abstain from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy".

"At the peak of virus replication in the blood, virus can often be detected in other body fluids, but the levels of virus are often much lower and there is no obvious or efficient means for the virus to get from that bodily fluid into another person's bloodstream."  The risks of different modes of infection are still unclear.  But experts say that the million-plus suspected cases in the Americas have been contained to areas where the mosquito is found, suggesting it does not spread easily through other means.  Brazil has seen 4,783 suspected cases of babies born with small brains, although only 404 have been confirmed, 709 have been rejected and 3,670 are still being investigated.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35441675	Zika outbreak: Travel advice	Zika virus has spread to more than 20 countries in the Americas.  The unprecedented and explosive outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease is causing fear in the affected regions.  While the effects are generally mild, the greatest concern is about a strongly suspected link with brain defects in babies.  There have been no travel bans, but what advice is there for people visiting the regions?  The Pan American Health Organization is publishing updates on the affected countries.  But the virus is expected to spread throughout North, Central and South America, except Canada and Chile, and people should check for the latest advice before travelling.  Only pregnant women have been advised to reconsider their plans to visit countries affected by Zika.  It is thought that within the female body the virus can travel across the placenta and affect the health of an unborn baby.  There has been a surge in microcephaly - in which the baby's brain does not develop properly - in Brazil.  The UK's National Travel Health Network and Centre says pregnant women should reconsider their travel plans, and that any traveller should seek advice from a health professional before departing.  And it adds that pregnant women who have to travel should take "scrupulous" measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.  The US Centers for Disease Control says women trying to get pregnant should "talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection [and] strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip."  Zika outbreak: What you need to know  The CDC says Zika lingers in the blood for approximately a week.  And: "The virus will not cause infections in a baby that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the blood.  "There is currently no evidence that Zika virus infection poses a risk of birth defects in future pregnancies."  Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which is most active during the day.  It is thought the virus can persist in semen for two weeks after a man recovers from an infection.  Public Health England is taking a safety-first approach after two suspected cases of sexual transmission.  The organisation says the risk of spreading the virus through sex is "very low".  But it recommends using condoms if you have a pregnant partner or one who might become pregnant.  This should be done for 28 days after coming home if you have no symptoms, and for six months if Zika symptoms do develop.  The US Centers of Disease Control advises either giving up sex or using condoms for the duration of a pregnancy.  Most infections do not result in symptoms, but they may include:  If you have symptoms such as fever, a rash, joint pain or red eyes, which develop either on holiday or when you return, then you should speak to a doctor.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35505196	Week ahead	There won't be many weeks between now and the likely date of the EU Referendum (23 June), when someone doesn't contrive to have some kind of Commons debate on some aspect of the EU.  Next week it's the DUP's turn. They're picking up the complaint made by the three first ministers, that that a referendum campaign culminating in a vote on that date, will impinge on the elections to the devolved parliaments.  Next on the Richter scale of political angst will be the annual debate on funding for local councils and police authorities in England - which will doubtless feature predictions of a collapse in key services. And after that there's an eclectic cocktail of railways, floods, rogue landlords and circus animals....  Meanwhile watch out for the election for the chair of the Environmental Audit Select Committee, where four Labour MPs are vying for the post vacated by Huw Irranca-Davies: Mary Creagh, Geraint Davies, Chris Evans and Barry Gardiner.  Over in the Lords, it's a rare week without the prospect of a government defeat, or indeed a vote of any kind...but fear not. Peers are merely gathering their powers for running battles over the detail of the Trade Union Bill and the Housing and Planning Bill, a bit later on.  One thing you won't find on this week's Lords agenda is the Scotland Bill, which has had its final day of committee stage debate kicked back beyond the half term, to allow time for more negotiation over the "fiscal framework" for devolution; this is the deal over the money the Scottish government will have to spend - it's not a part of the bill, but it is pretty hard to understand the implication s of the bill without it.  The framework is essentially an intergovernmental treaty between London and Edinburgh, and will set out how funding will be allocated between the nations of the UK. For example, will Scotland end up with a smaller share of the cake if the population of England increases faster?  Given the framework, the expectation is that the bill would be rushed into report stage, without waiting the normal couple of weeks - and be signed into law in good time for the Scottish Parliament elections in May.  The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - and, as ever, the end of question time (3.30pm) is the likely moment for taking any ministerial statements or urgent questions.  The main business is the vote on the annual up-rating of Social Security Benefits and the State Pension - which is both very big, and completely routine.  After that MPs move on to a backbench debate on the future of the routes of the Great Western Railway - the Conservative Kevin Foster will lead a debate looking at the need for electrification and resilience measures, as well as other improvements on the rail services covering the South West and South Wales.  The day's adjournment debate is on flood insurance for businesses - Calder Valley MP Craig Whittaker will be raising the plight of businesses hit by floods in 2012, which were then unable to afford the flood element of their insurance. Having been flooded again this winter, several have now folded. Mr Whittaker will press for some pool insurance system to be set up to provide protection for them.  In the Lords (2.30pm), peers put the final touches to the Education and Adoption Bill - with the normally pretty perfunctory third reading debate, and then move on to the first of four scheduled days of detailed committee stage consideration of the Trade Union Bill.  They are supposed to deal with the clauses on ballot thresholds for industrial action, e-balloting and other balloting methods, information requirements relating to industrial action, the timing and duration of industrial action, and the impact of the bill on devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There had been some talk that we could be into the kind of delaying tactics not seen in the Lords since the early days of the Coalition, when Labour fought the Parliamentary Voting and Constituencies Bill to a standstill.  But, while there are an awful lot of amendments down, I'm told the Opposition is not now likely to force any amendments to a vote; having pushed through the establishment of a special select committee to consider the party funding aspects of the bill, they are content to let the debates play out as normal, and wait for the committee to report before making their moves.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Health questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem education spokesman John Pugh, which would give schools a right to challenge critical judgements by the standards watchdog, Ofsted. He will argue that the consequences of critical report from Ofsted are so serious for schools and their staff that there has got to be some redress and appeal against an unfair, clumsily managed or politically skewed report.  And he wants appeals against Ofsted judgements to be heard by independent regional panels with nominees from the professional associations. Appeals could not only be about the content of inspection but also about the procedure and timing of inspections where that may give an unrepresentative picture of school performance.  They day's main debates are on motions from two of the smaller opposition parties, first the DUP, then the Lib Dems.  The DUP motion is pretty sharp-edged. It:  "regrets that the government appears set to rush to a referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union in June 2016; believes that no case has been made for doing so, and that further, any such needlessly premature date risks contaminating the result; believes that a subject as fundamental as EU membership should be decisively settled after a full and comprehensive debate; notes the recommendations of the Electoral Commission as to best practice for referendums; further notes that there are elections happening in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, London and some local authorities in May 2016 and that the First Ministers of each of the devolved administrations have all expressed opposition to a June referendum date; and resolves that the Government should set the date for the Referendum having respect to the May elections as distinct electoral choices."  This will provide a chance for MPs to vote on the complaint - made repeatedly this week - that a 23 June referendum would mean the EU question overshadowed the elections for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh National Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. So expect the issue to be pushed to a vote.  The Liberal Democrats are being cagey about the content of their debate - when their Leader Tim Farron will speak on housing. The text of their motion will not surface until Monday.  The day ends with an adjournment debate on jobs and growth in the Humber Energy Estuary led by the Conservative, Martin Vickers. He will be asking for a progress report on the off-shore renewables sector.  In Westminster Hall, the day's debates range across: closer working between the emergency services (9.30am -11am); multi-sports clubs and HMRC changes to community amateur sports club status (11am-11.30am); work capability assessments (2.30pm -4pm); communications infrastructure and flooding in the North West (4pm- 4.30pm) and the social mobility index (4.30pm- 5.30pm).  In the Lords (2.30pm) peers have the third reading of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill - where the remaining issue outstanding is the Guardian's Allowance. It's not expected to be forced to a vote.  Then they launch into committee stage scrutiny of the Housing and Planning Bill - with the first of an expected seven days of debate. On the first day the House is supposed to debate the clauses dealing with rogue landlords and property agents in England; Banning Orders; the database of rogue landlords and property agents; rent payment orders and recovering abandoned premises in England. This is another highly contentious measure where Opposition peers will be pushing for changes, and there are already an impressive number down for debate.  The Commons warms up (11.30am) with Scottish questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time  Then Conservative MP Will Quince has a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Wild Animals in Circuses (Prohibition) - this picks up a cause which led to a spectacular backbench debate in the last Parliament, where the government backed off from whipping opposition against a ban - and MPs voted through a motion calling for one. But nothing happened.  MPs will then go through what has become an increasingly touchy annual ritual; the motions to approve the Police Grant and Local Government Finance reports for England. Expect a chorus of appeals for more money for particular localities - with the new element of rising concern about the finances of the police.  MPs will also be asked to approve new rules on the notification of Parliament of arrest of members. By ancient tradition, the arrest of an MP for any reason is noted in the business documents sent out to MPs every sitting day; this dates back to the time when such arrests were a tactic used by the Crown against the Commons.  After a number of recent cases the Commons Procedure Committee is seeking to change the rules so that arrests are only reported where they could be interpreted as an interference with Parliament.  In Westminster Hall the debates cover contracts let by the Home Office for asylum support (9.30am -11am); migration into the EU (2.30pm - 4pm); mobile infrastructure project (4pm - 4.30pm) and the UK government's policy on refugees (4.30pm-5.30pm).  But the 11am-11.30am Westminster Hall debate is one for the parliamentary nerds; it's on the implementation of the recommendations of the Digital Democracy Commission. This was an initiative by the Speaker, which reported in January 2015.  One of the Commission members, Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who now chairs the Public Accounts Committee, wants to keep up the pressure for electronic voting to be used in the Commons.  She would still like the voting to take place in the lobbies on either side of the chamber, arguing that the crush of all MPs there provides an invaluable opportunity for backbenchers to grab a quick word with ministers. But she would like a system that generates a result more rapidly and accurately. And she will be pressing the Leader of the House to launch a pilot scheme in this Parliament.  In the Lords (3pm) it's day two of the Trade Union Bill committee stage, where peers should be onto the sections dealing with picketing and the application of funds for political objects (clauses 9-11) - keep an eye on their progress.  And during the dinner break, there will be a short debate on the action being taken to promote cycling as a safe means of transport lead by the former Transport Secretary, Lord Young of Cookham, the artist formerly known as Sir George Young, aka: the bicycling baronet.  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, setting out what MPs will be considering when they return from their half-term break.  The day's main debates, chosen by the Backbench Business Committee, are on justice for Equitable Life policy-holders, where the motion notes that most people who lost out from the scandal have not been fully compensated, as recommended by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.  Next comes a debate on conservation of sea bass and the effect of related EU measures on the UK fishing industry - the Conservative MP Scott Mann believes that the latest regulations forbids anglers from catching sea bass with fishing lines, while still allowing them to be netted commercially.  And the day ends with an adjournment debate on the police handling of the Poppi Worthington case, the 13-months-old child who died in December 2012, led by the local MP, John Woodcock. He will be pressing for immediate official release of the leaked IPCC report, which criticises the now-acting chief constable and calling for an independent inquiry  In Westminster Hall (at 1.30pm) there's a Backbench Business Committee debate on the persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslims and other religious minorities in Pakistan, led by Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. She is concerned about the rising hate speech in Pakistan against religious minorities, leading to a spate of murders and blasphemy prosecutions.  In the Lords (from 11am), the day's main legislating is on the second reading of the Armed Forces Bill. This is partly a constitutional measure, renewing the parliamentary approval required for the Army, Navy and Air Force to exist.  But it also includes measures to modernise and strengthen the service justice system, including powers for post-accident testing for alcohol and drugs, and a requirement for serious offences to be referred for prosecution rather than dealt with by a Commanding Officer, plus issues on battlefield legal immunity and human rights, and reservists. Will the question of war-crime allegations against British troops surface?  The final business is a motion to approve the Recall of MPs Act 2015 (Recall Petition) Regulations 2015 - the detailed workings of the new system that will allow voters to throw out errant MPs in certain very limited circumstances. There's a regret motion down from Labour's Baroness Hayter, but given that this is the last business on the last day before the Parliamentary half-term, it would be surprising if it was forced to a vote.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35493892	Zika: The key unanswered questions	This grainy image is one of the few pictures of the Zika virus.  The infection has prompted the World Health Organization to declared a global health emergency due to the link to thousands of suspected cases of babies born with small brains - or microcephaly - in Brazil.  But there are still many, crucial, unanswered questions.  The best estimate of Zika infections is between 500,000 and 1.5 million - which is quite a wide margin of error. What percentage of people in an affected area are getting infected? Is it everyone? We don't know.  One theory is that the virus has mutated to become more infectious. Alternatively, some experts argue it could simply be a case of the virus reaching areas where people are densely packed together and there are huge numbers of mosquitoes.  Around 80% of people have no symptoms when they get the virus - although this figure needs further investigation. It's not known if they can also spread the virus or even why they are asymptomatic.  It's the biggest health concern in the outbreak, yet the link with Zika and birth defects is still only "strongly suspected". Parts of Brazil that have seen cases of Zika have, several months later, also seen a surge in microcephaly. However, the trials to prove the link have not finished.  If the virus does cause microcephaly, how often does this happen? Does every infection lead to birth defects? Or is it one-in-100? One-in-10,000 perhaps? At the moment it's not clear how worried pregnant women should be.  If the virus causes microcephaly, does it matter when you are infected? There have been some suggestions that the first trimester (the first 12 weeks) is key, but other doctors have hinted there might be risks as late as 29 weeks. And those risks could change over time.  Some infections, such as rubella, can damage the brains of developing babies during pregnancy. But it is not known how Zika could be crossing the placenta and damaging brain growth.  Around four-in-five people infected will not develop symptoms. Do silent infections carry the same risks of microcephaly as those which result in a fever or a rash? There is also the rare neurological disease Guillain-Barre syndrome that has been linked to Zika infection and we don't know which patients are most a risk.  The virus was first detected in Africa and then parts of Asia until it reached Brazil and then spread. So do these continents represent giant vulnerable populations susceptible to Zika outbreaks? Or has Zika been around and undetected there for years, so that most of the population are immune? It is hard to establish the global threat without knowing the answer.  There are big questions about the quality of the data, both before the outbreak of Zika and now. The figures for previous years may be underestimates, and the number of suspected cases is an overestimate. Of the 4,783 reported cases of microcephaly - 404 have been confirmed, 709 have been disproved and 3,670 are still being investigated.  The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, but it is confined to tropical and sub-tropical countries. There is concern that Zika could be spread by other mosquitoes too such as the Asian tiger mosquito. This species prefers more temperate climes such as parts of Europe.  It seems likely that the overwhelming majority of cases are spread by the Aedes mosquito where the insect bites a person with the virus and passes it onto the next person it bites. But sexual transmission has been implicated in a couple of infections. It's unknown how common this is.  Are you infected once and then protected for life, like measles? Or does it take multiple infections to achieve immunity? How long does immunity last? These answers will tell us how long the outbreak could last and indicate whether a vaccine would be effective.	health

Labour peer Lord Carter's report found nearly one in 10 beds was taken by someone medically fit to be released.  It said it was a "major problem" causing operations to be cancelled and resulting in the NHS paying private hospitals to see patients.  Union Unison said cuts to social care were a major cause of "bed-blocking".  Lord Carter identified the issue in a wider look at how £5bn could be saved by 2020.  His proposals called for better procurement and staff management, and savings to the drugs bill.  But delayed discharges are likely to be prove a more intractable problem as it is largely not down to the actions of hospitals.  Vulnerable and frail patients cannot be released if there is not the support in the community from home care workers or district nursing staff or a place in a care home.  While official statistics suggest about 5,500 patients a day are affected, the report said information provided by trusts estimates as many as 8,500 beds in acute trusts were being blocked.  It highlighted the growing trend to pay private hospitals to do NHS work, such as knee and hip operations, as a consequence of this.  Last year the NHS spent £11bn in the private sector - a rise of 11% on the previous year. Lord Carter said delayed discharges was likely to be a "contributory factor" in this.  Delayed discharges have also been blamed as one of the causes of growing waiting times in A&E as doctors struggle to find beds for patients who need to be admitted.  Meanwhile, Lord Carter said hospitals across England must end "stark" differences in spending and productivity, Lord Carter added.  He found the average cost of an inpatient treatment is £3,500 but said there was 20% variation between the most expensive trusts and the least expensive.  Lord Carter said: "My experience of the NHS and hospitals internationally is that high-quality patient care and sound financial management go hand in hand."  Hospitals consume £55bn of health spending - about half the annual budget. So a £5bn efficiency target is very ambitious.  But as a sign of the mountain the health service has to climb in the coming years, consider this: it doesn't even go a quarter of the way to achieving the overall savings the health service is aiming for.  In return for the extra £8bn it is getting this Parliament, the NHS has pledged to save £22bn.  It means the rest will have to come from people improving their lifestyles (and so preventing ill-health), moving care out of hospitals and into the community (which is cheaper) and keeping tight control on salaries. It promises to be a tough few years.  Lord Carter, who published an interim report in the summer, identified the following savings:  Each hospital has been set its own individual savings targets. These are not being released publicly although the progress trusts make will be monitored.  Ministers said they expected the savings to be made.  Christina McAnea, head of health for Unison, which represents many NHS workers including nurses and paramedics as well as administrative staff, said the report contained many good ideas.  However, she said the report failed to address the lack of social care in the community that was the "main reason why people can't be discharged".  "On average social care has been cut by around 25% and that has an almost immediate knock on effect in the NHS, because you can't discharge patients unless you've got the infrastructure back in the community to support them," she said.  "And that's where we've seen massive cuts, so it's about care workers, some community nursing, it's about health visitors."  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "This ground-breaking review will help hospitals care for patients, making sure every penny possible is spent on front line patient care and bureaucracy is slashed so doctors and nurses can concentrate on caring."  Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said: "This report is absolutely right to highlight the huge financial pressures that delayed discharges are placing on the NHS. However, ministers cannot shy away from the fact that this is a crisis in care that has happened on their watch."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35494660	Cancer Drugs Fund 'should be managed better', say MPs	A special NHS fund for cancer medicines in England needs to be managed more effectively, says a committee of MPs.  In its report on the Cancer Drugs Fund, the Public Accounts Committee said it was unacceptable that the benefit to patients was still not clear.  The fund was set up in 2010 to improve access to cancer drugs that would not be routinely available on the NHS.  The fund, which is expected to have cost £1.27bn by April 2017, has helped more than 80,000 cancer patients.  Before any drugs can be given to patients on the NHS, they have to be recommended by the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which looks at how well they work and whether they are cost-effective.  But if drugs are not recommended or have yet to be appraised by NICE, the Cancer Drugs Fund can step in and choose to fund cancer treatment.  The fund was initially managed by strategic health authorities. But since April 2013, it has been managed by NHS England.  The MPs' committee says there is no evidence the fund is benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money.  Money has had to be diverted from primary care to cover two years of overspends.  The £480m budget for the two years from 2013 to 2015 was overspent by £167m.  Its total budget, of £1.27bn, takes the fund to April, when the system will be overhauled.  The MPs recommend more thorough information is collected about how patients are benefiting from the drugs.  And they say tough decisions will need to be made about spending.  The fund has already had to drastically reduce the number of treatments it pays for, and the MPs' report questions whether it has done enough to fund medicines for rarer cancers.  A spokesman for NHS England said: "While we welcome the committee's support for a redesigned cancer drugs fund, we hope their explicit call for cuts to cancer drugs prices charged to the fund will be borne in mind as complex decisions on its future are taken in the next few months."	health

She said a number of incidents had given PCCs a "bad name", including criticism by Surrey's Kevin Hurley of his former chief constable Lynne Owens.  But she also revealed she was planning to extend the powers of PCCs after their elections in May.  This could include them setting up free schools for "troubled children".  PCCs, who replaced the previous model of police authorities, have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.  They were first elected in November 2012 on a historically low turnout, and the next set of elections takes place in May.  At a Policy Exchange event in London, Mrs May acknowledged some of the problems involving PCCs had made her wonder if she had done the right thing by establishing the system as a replacement for police authorities.  She said: "In 2012, you could be forgiven for thinking that we were creating a monster. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't times over the last three and a half years when I thought we might have done just that."  She highlighted incidents including the former South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright's initial refusal to resign following damning revelations of child sexual abuse in Rotherham; the appointment of a youth commissioner in Kent with no background checks, only for her to have to stand down after it was revealed she had posted offensive tweets as a teenager; and the dispute involving Mr Hurley.  The BBC recently learned Mr Hurley had strongly criticised his chief constable Lynne Owens before her appointment as the new National Crime Agency head.  "These episodes have been disappointing and there's no doubt that some of them have brought the office of the PCC into disrepute," said Mrs May.  Labour has said it would abolish PCCs and put the savings into front-line policing.  But Mrs May proposed an expansion of their role. She said the government had not yet decided the "full extent" of its proposed changes but said there were "significant" opportunities for reform.  "The next set of PCCs should bring together the two great reforms of the last Parliament - police reform and school reform - to work with and possibly set up alternative-provision free schools to support troubled children and prevent them from falling into a life of crime," she said.  The home secretary suggested mergers between PCCs and directly elected mayors, saying there was a "fantastic opportunity" for policing and other services to be brought together "under a single directly elected mayor".  PCCs could also have a role in youth justice, probation and court services, she said.  This suggestion was welcomed by the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said it "makes sense" to give locally elected leaders control over the services.  The think tank's Jonathan Clifton said: "This will enable them to join up with other local services and tackle the things that lead to offending - such as lack of qualifications, mental health problems and homelessness."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35486047	Care for bereaved parents 'must improve'	Bereavement services for families whose babies are stillborn or die shortly after birth are "not good enough", a government health minister has said.  It follows an investigation by Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach who found services were "patchy" with some parents unable to access help.  She broke down in the Commons last year as she spoke about losing her own baby.  Neonatal care minister Ben Gummer said he was working to ensure there was consistent support across the UK.  In 2013, one in every 216 births in the UK was a stillbirth, while one in every 370 babies died within the first four weeks of life, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.  Mrs Sandbach, who represents Eddisbury in Cheshire and is a former Welsh Assembly Member, has been investigating the disparity of bereavement care in hospitals in the UK.  Her son, Sam, died in 2009 from sudden infant death syndrome when he was five days old. She says there was no bereavement counselling available where she lived and she only got help when a charity paid for a counsellor to visit her home.  Mrs Sandbach told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: "Parents who are coping with the pain bewilderment and grief of losing a child should not need to battle for support.  "The best hospital trusts have a clear pathway to that support and the Department of Health needs to use the resources it has committed to ensure that is available across the NHS."  Amelia Renshaw had twins in 2014, but her daughter Isabel got bronchiolitis and died at six weeks old.  "The hospital was great. They helped us make a memory box, all the little, little things that make it slightly more bearable.  "But once we'd left there was nothing there - I was given the numbers of five or six organisations to speak to for support. Every time I had to tell the story, which was more than painful at that time.  "I had five "nos" and I was mortified, so upset, because I needed this support really early, and I was just getting "no" because she was too young, too old, didn't die of the right thing, and it was just horrendous.  "Isabel died on 3 January - I think I saw somebody in the middle to the end of March, and she was fantastic, but in that period I didn't know what I was doing, I needed guidance.  "I told her how I was feeling and she said it was normal and fine and it was like a huge relief. But if only I'd had that at the beginning."  Stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands recommended that each hospital should have a dedicated midwife specifically trained in bereavement care, who ensures the entire team is trained.  There should also be soundproofed facilities with equipment such as cold cots to accommodate the bereaved and parents should be offered ongoing aftercare, it said.  "The impact empathetic, sensitive, individualised care has on parents is huge. They remember the care they receive, and good care can make a huge difference to their memories of that difficult experience and make a huge difference to their grieving," said Cheryl Tithererly, of the charity.  One hospital which is considered to give good care is the Alder Centre at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool. Parents can spend time with their baby in a bereavement suite where they are supported by staff who can help them register a death, liaise with the coroner or arrange the child's funeral. It also offers counselling and a 24-hour helpline.  John, the counsellor who worked with Mrs Sandbach said: "I think you'll find that what we've got here in this part of the country is unique. We will support any parent who can get to us - what we've found is there's a lot of areas that don't have bereavement support."  Minister for Neonatal Care Ben Gummer said: "The problem is a smaller one than it was some years ago but it's still not good enough.  "You might get some hospitals with a good bereavement suite but there isn't a full-time bereavement nurse, and there might not be good counselling after a death.  "What we need to do is make sure we have a really joined-up pathway in all hospitals so we provide consistent support."  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?  David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.  It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to.  The prime minister insists this will "make a difference" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main "pull factors" attracting people to the UK.  But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.  Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was "unlikely to have a huge impact".  The main "pull factor" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.  Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.  Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's "emergency brake" on benefits would be "unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration".  Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.  The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).  It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.  But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.  Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.  The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK.  About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.  A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.  David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.  UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.  But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.  There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.  Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident.  David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase "ever closer union" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties.  He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used.  The "red card" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.  London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.  In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament "beyond doubt".  Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.  Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.  There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.  And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.  Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice.  But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.  He said then: "The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."	politics

In 2013, 284 out of every 100,000 people died from cancer. In 2003, it was 312. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are thought to be the reason.  The death rate for men fell 12% and for women by 8%, narrowing the gender gap.  But the actual number of cancer deaths rose - from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013 - as more people live longer and develop the disease in old age.  "The population is growing, and more of us are living longer," Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said.  Almost half of all the cancer deaths in 2013 were from lung, bowel, breast or prostate cancer.  But the combined death rate for these four cancers had dropped by about 11% over the past 10 years, while some other cancers, such as liver and pancreatic, had increased death rates.  Sir Harpal said: "Too many people are still being diagnosed with and dying from cancer, not just here in the UK but around the world."  He said CRUK was focusing research on how to achieve earlier diagnosis and manage hard-to-treat cancers.  "Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques, and drugs," he said.  "It's important to celebrate how much things have improved, but also to renew our commitment to saving the lives of more cancer patients."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35485176	'Suicide prevention app' trial	An NHS mental health trust is working with US researchers to develop an app that may stop people from killing themselves.  Liverpool-based Merseycare and Stanford University have been in talks on how the technology could work.  The aim is to have the prototype ready by June with the first patients being monitored in January.  There were 6,122 suicides in the UK in 2014 - a 2% decrease on the year before.  The app would allow clinicians to provide round-the-clock observations on people who they fear may be considering suicide.  It would work by monitoring all digital communications by a patient - emails, social media, even phone calls - and spot potential dangers.  Three quarters of suicides are in men.  If for instance someone was tracked as being at a well-known suicide hotspot, or missed an appointment, or even told a friend they were feeling suicidal, the app would alert clinicians who would then be able to contact the person and provide appropriate support.  All patients would have to voluntarily submit to being monitored.  Dr David Fearnley, medical director at Merseycare, said: "The potential is incredible."  He added: "We think we can anticipate people who may be likely to harm themselves with greater accuracy than we currently do, and therefore be able to do something about it and save their lives."  Last year, Merseycare committed itself to a zero suicide policy by 2020, meaning they hope to end all suicides of service users.  The initiative requires a new approach across the trust, from staff training to greater patient involvement.  The development of the app is part of that process, and is based on a belief that people are often more open with their friends and relatives than they are with clinicians.  "This is an opportunity to exploit technology in a way we've never been able to before in health, by providing very powerful, decision-making, statistical support to clinicians in real time for the people who are most at risk," added Dr Fearnley.  The development of the app builds on work that five NHS trusts and US hospitals are already engaged in.  Their collaboration has created technology that is already scanning all the data being inputted in the trusts, digitising and analysing it and telling medics - within hours - where danger signs, such as falls or medication problems, are emerging.  Merseycare and Stanford are aiming for patients to start using the app in January 2017; its success will then be evaluated by outside experts over the following three years.	health

Peers were due to resume line-by-line scrutiny on 9 February but that has now been put back until 22 February.  The Scottish government wants a deal concluded by 12 February to allow time for it to be examined at Holyrood.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell has informed Holyrood's Devolution Committee of the delay.  The negotiations on the fiscal framework - the financial arrangements underpinning the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament - have proved both protracted and complicated.  The Scottish government has said there is still "some distance to go" before a deal can be agreed and threatened to veto any formula that was "unfair to Scotland".  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned recently that Scotland stood to lose billions of pounds over the next few years under the Treasury's current proposals.  Talks between the two governments are due to resume in Edinburgh on Monday.  In a letter to Holyrood's Devolution Committee, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The fiscal framework talks are continuing, and I am optimistic about the process. I am doing everything I can to secure an agreement which is durable and fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK.  "All through the process we have made time for these issues to be properly considered and discussed, and that remains the case.  "I want to ensure both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Lords have as much information as possible for their consideration. It has been agreed, therefore, that the next parliamentary stage of the Scotland Bill will be rescheduled.  "This will allow more time for negotiations between the Scottish and UK Governments to progress. I am confident both parliaments will have the opportunity to properly consider the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework before the Scottish Parliament's dissolution on March 23."  Deputy First Minister John Swinney responded to Mr Mundell's letter, promising the Scottish government would do "all we can" to secure an agreement.  But he added: "We will not sign up to any proposed agreement which short changes Scotland by locking in long-term cuts to our budget.  "We are working to a deadline of February 12th for talks to be concluded because the Scottish Parliament requested this, as members need time to properly scrutinise and vote on an agreed fiscal framework package before it is dissolved next month ahead of May's election - but we will give all the time possible to secure a deal."  Earlier the Treasury minister negotiating on behalf of the UK government said he was "confident" a deal would be reached.  Greg Hands said he had cleared his diary for a full day of talks in Edinburgh next Monday and he remained "upbeat" that an agreement would be struck.  What is the fiscal framework?  He told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee: "I'm ready to deal. I'm off to Edinburgh on Monday and I remain upbeat on that possibility.  "The UK government remains committed to getting that deal."  An agreement would set out how Scotland's annual block grant from the Treasury will be adjusted to take account of the new tax powers.  Mr Hands insisted the proposals will provide "huge new opportunities" for the Scottish government to grow the economy.  The deal must be "fair to taxpayers in Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK", he told the committee.  Mr Hands said: "Neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be better or worse off as result of the initial act of devolution.  "Thereafter, the Scottish government should bear the fruit of good policy decisions and the consequences of poor policy decisions."  The committee chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, warned that Mr Hands and Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney appeared to have "very different perspectives" on the long-running negotiations.  "There does seem to be some distance to go in terms of getting an agreement on this," Mr Wishart said.  Scottish Labour had earlier called for the 12 February deadline to be abandoned, and said neither side should walk away until a deal is reached.  The party has criticised a lack of transparency in negotiations and called on minutes of meetings to be published.  Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: "Over the past few days we have seen the negotiations descend into a blame game.  "People across Scotland will not understand that after the negotiation for more powers, this deal could fall apart at the last minute."	politics

The Carter Centre, which was set up by former President Jimmy Carter, said that represented a 83% drop from the 126 cases reported last year.  Guinea worm isn't deadly, but it is extremely painful and stops people in some of the world's poorest areas from going to work or school for months.  The former president said he wants it eradicated "next year or sooner after".  It's carried by tiny water flies which sit in stagnant water. When people drink that water the Guinea worm larvae enters the body and starts maturing into a worm.  After about a year, when it's grown to around a meter long, it starts burrowing through the body and eventually causes a painful blister on the skin's surface.  It can then take a few days or weeks to fully emerge from the body, usually through the victim's leg or foot.  The Carter Centre has led the international effort against the disease, and the end game is very much in sight.  "This is a very exciting, challenging and sometimes frustrating experience for us," he said.  The former president made it his mission to wipe out the disease back in 1986.  Since then he said the number of countries reporting cases have gone from 21, to just four: Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.  "We hope this year we won't have any new cases, but if we do we'll just have to concentrate on those communities," said Mr Carter.  The former president said across those countries still affected there were actually only 20 villages and communities in the world which have cases of Guinea worm, although teams are still monitoring around 4,500 communities to ensure the disease doesn't come back.  "One person who goes into the water with a Guinea worm emerging can start the whole epidemic all over again," he said.  If the campaign is successful, Guinea worm will become only the second disease to ever be completely wiped out.  Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980. Polio is also on the verge of being made extinct.  The British government has pledged another £4.5 million to efforts to finally end Guinea worm.  UK International Development Minister Nick Hurd said: "Guinea worm is a truly horrendous disease.  "The fact that we are now so close to eradicating it is one of the great public health success stories of modern times."  Mr Carter said around 88 million cases have been avoided in the last 30 years, meaning it's cost around $3 (£2) to prevent each case.  "Once we get rid of it, we'll never have to spend another dollar on the disease," he said.  One of the biggest threats to Guinea worm eradication is conflict, which stops health workers being able to go in and help affected communities.  Mr Carter said another concern is dogs becoming infected and releasing larvae into water sources, which communities can then drink from, triggering a new cluster of cases.  The 39th President of the United States said achieving the eradication of Guinea worm would be his "most gratifying experience".  While emerging viruses such as Zika and before that Ebola have been causing a lot of concern, this is a timely reminder that complex and frightening diseases, can be beaten. The world is not there yet, but it is extremely close.  Mr Carter is already setting his sights on the next debilitating disease he wants to wipe out.  It's another neglected tropical disease called river blindness, spread by the bites of infected flies that breed in rapidly flowing rivers and can cause people to lose their sight.  He says eradication is possible. Watch this space.	health

The findings, in Nature Communications, show how the parasite has adapted to survive by making detoxifying enzymes that destroy pesticides.  And it has grown thicker skin, which helps guard against chemical attack.  But there is a stage in the bug's life when it might be easier to kill.  This is as a young nymph, before it has had its first taste of human blood, according to the two teams of international researchers - one based at the American Museum of Natural History and the other working out of the University of Cincinnati and Baylor College of Medicine, Texas.  Bed bugs survive on a diet of blood alone, and it is not until the pest has begun to feed that some of the genes that govern these self-defence mechanisms against pesticides get switched on.  Another weakness might be their relationship with bacteria that live on, in and around them - their microbiome.  The researchers discovered the bed-bug microbiome contains more than 1,500 genes that probably contribute to their growth and reproduction.  Attacking these beneficial bacteria might prove to be a powerful weapon against bed bugs, alongside new pesticides.  Dr George Amato, one of the study authors from the museum, said: "We have been learning so much about microbiomes recently, and we know that it's not just that micro-organisms live on and in individuals, but in many ways play a critical role.  "This might provide a vulnerability we can use."  Some of the work is part of a project called i5k - an ambitious initiative to sequence the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species, to benefit medicine, agriculture and ecology.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35483522	David Cameron urged to delay EU referendum by first ministers	The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged David Cameron not to hold an EU referendum in June, saying it will "distract" from devolved elections taking place in May.  Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Arlene Foster have written to the PM to urge him to defer the date.  They say a June date will "confuse" the process and make it hard for them to campaign effectively in the referendum.  Mr Cameron told MPs that voters were able to differentiate between polls.  David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017 but said he wants to get on with it and is reported to favour a poll on 23 June.  However, the exact timing hinges on whether EU leaders agree to the draft package of reforms published on Tuesday at a summit next month, which would pave the way for a poll at the end of June.  In their letter, the three first ministers say it is vital that voters are properly informed about the issue at stake in the referendum and this could be compromised if the campaign overlaps with that for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Stormont Parliament on 5 May.  "We believe that holding a referendum as early as June will mean that a significant part of the referendum campaign will necessarily run in parallel with those elections and risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required," they write.  Opposition in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to an early referendum has been building in recent weeks.  There is concern that a date just weeks after the 5 May election would mean the campaigns become confused or there wouldn't be time to properly consider the European issue.  It is interesting to note the Labour Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones has signed this letter.  Nationally his party favours a June vote - Alan Johnson, the leader of the Labour In campaign said yesterday his party would not stand in the way of a 23 June referendum. And last night, Scottish Labour's leader Kezia Dugdale told BBC Scotland she was happy for the vote to be held then.  But expect continued pressure from devolved governments and administrations on this issue. Even if David Cameron can persuade other European leaders of his renegotiation plans, it's possible he will face significant opposition domestically on the date.  "Furthermore, it will be virtually impossible for the political parties in our respective territories to plan effectively for, and where appropriate work together on, the referendum campaign while our own elections are in progress.  "We believe that the European Referendum is of vital importance to the future of the whole United Kingdom and the debate leading up to it should, therefore, be free of other campaigning distraction."  Raising the letter during Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Angus Robertson said the PM should show "respect" for the voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and make a commitment not to hold the poll in June.  Mr Cameron said no date had been agreed but he could guarantee that the referendum would not be held within six weeks of devolved elections, which he claimed had been asked for by former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond.  "I respect the electorates of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis that I think people are perfectly able of making up their minds in a local election or Scottish Parliamentary election and then a period of some weeks later making up their mind all over again on the vital question of the European Union," he said.  "No date has been fixed and there must be a six-week gap but, frankly, I think he is looking for things to complain about."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35479749	GP pressures: Care potentially unsafe	Pressures on GPs in England and Wales are so great they feel they are failing patients and potentially providing unsafe care, doctors leaders say.  British Medical Association GP leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said doctors were having to rush patients to keep up.  And he said this could be potentially dangerous in terms of identifying cancer and getting medicines right.  But ministers in England responded by promising they would invest in services to address the concerns.  The frank admission by Dr Nagpaul comes as the BMA releases the results of an online survey of nearly 2,900 practices in England and 145 in Wales - about one in three of the total in both nations.  In England it showed that 55% thought the quality of the service their practices was providing had deteriorated in the past 12 months.  Some 68% said their workload was unmanageable, while 92% reported demand had increased in the past year.  Dr Nagpaul said: "It is unsustainable and getting to the point where it is not safe. The ageing population means many of our patients have multiple conditions and are on multiple medicines, but we simply don't have the time to properly consider how they interact.  "On cancer we are having to make rushed decisions. And we are seeing growing numbers of patients with dementia - and yet just have 10 minutes to see them.  "It's not enough. We are being forced to let down patients. We need to see more investment in general practice so we can keep up with demand and have longer 15-minute consultations."  The issue has been raised by the BMA just a week after the NHS England report into the death of 12-month-old William Mead, from Cornwall, highlighted workload pressures as one of the possible reasons GPs failed to properly diagnose his chest infection.  Mr Nagpaul believes another 10,000 GPs could be needed to plug the current gap in England - the government has promised another 5,000 this Parliament, but that is expected to cover the push to provide seven-day opening.  To pay for this, funding for GPs will be increasing by 5% every year, the government has said.  Health minister Alistair Burt added: "General practice is at the heart of the improvement we want to see in the NHS. We recognise absolutely that it is under pressure, which is why we are delivering record investment.  "The health secretary will shortly announce further support for GPs, which should assist in meeting the pressures doctors are reporting."  Are you a GP in England or Wales?

The government's "devolution revolution" to councils includes housing, transport and planning.  The Communities and Local Government Committee welcomed the policy but said there was a "significant lack of public consultation" in the process.  Councils said they recognised the "need for greater public engagement".  Greater Manchester has been at the forefront of the government's move to devolve powers and spending controls to local government through a series of "deals" with each area.  Chancellor George Osborne has hailed Manchester's deal as creating a "Northern Powerhouse", and similar agreements have been struck with other regions in England, which have to adopt ministers' preferred model of an elected mayor in return.  The committee said it strongly supported the principle of devolution, saying the current deals "should be the starting point, not the destination".  But the MPs, who held a public evidence session in Greater Manchester as part of their inquiry, also said many people had complained about a lack of consultation.  "The vast majority of contributions, often made in angry tones, arose from the perceived lack of efforts by the combined authority to engage the public about the deal relating to their local area," the committee said.  "For devolution to take root and fulfil its aims, it needs to involve and engage the people it is designed to benefit. There has been a consistent very significant lack of public consultation, engagement and communication at all stages of the deal-making process."  Council leaders from other parts of the country told the committee the public had not been consulted before their deals were agreed.  It is particularly important to engage the public where health powers are being devolved, the MPs said, because "the public's response is likely to be more emotional".  The committee said the government had driven the first wave of devolution deals through "at rapid pace", which meant "no opportunity for engagement with residents", but said council leaders should still have communicated the deal to residents and told them how they would be affected.  The Department for Communities and Local Government said it welcomed the committee's support for its "devolution revolution" and said there was "no one-size-fits-all approach" for different areas.  Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said: "While it is right that devolution deals are not imposed, but negotiated and secured by local places, we recognise the need for greater public engagement throughout the deal-making process and are working with councils to support them in this."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35423400	Are we fighting cancer the right way?	A huge amount of effort and money is spent fighting cancer globally. But are we getting that fight right?  With the number of new cancer cases set to hit 24m by 2035, do we need to rethink our approach?  Four experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme.  Dr Vincent DeVita is one of the leading cancer specialists in the USA, and helped develop a cure for Hodgkin's disease in the 1960s.  "The process we're going through now stifles innovation. We're doing a lot of things right. We're in the middle of a molecular revolution, but we're not taking advantage of all the information that we have because of the regulatory apparatus.  "A few years ago a study looked at how long it took an idea to [become a cancer treatment] protocol, be approved and initiated. The average was 800 days, in some cases 1,000.  "And if you made a change in the protocol, you had to start all over again. In some cases, 29 signatures were required to approve a protocol.  "The programme which ultimately cured Hodgkin's disease took us three years. It would take us 15 years to do it now.  "Cancer cells are wily. If you just attack them with one drug, they quickly learn how to get around it. The idea of combination chemotherapy is to hit them in three or four different areas at the same time. We have proof that you require combinations of some sort for the great majority of cancers.  "A lot of innovation occurs in what we call the 'post-marketing period' for drugs. The drug gets approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and then doctors can mix and match and do studies. Nowadays that is very tightly regulated.  "I lost my sister in May from lung cancer. A drug that is now working very well on lung cancer was available in her hospital. It had already been approved by the FDA for melanoma, so we knew it was safe but they had not yet approved it for lung cancer so she couldn't get it even though it was the best drug available.  "She missed an opportunity to have maybe a 60% chance of a good prolongation of her life. That's happening all over the country - drugs are being tested in ways that are unnecessary, delaying access to patients who can benefit from them.  "It's all very-intentioned. It's done in the name of the protection of patients, but I think we let the pendulum swing a little bit too far in the other direction."  Heidi Williams is an assistant economics professor at MIT.  "If you look at drugs that get approved by the FDA, they all tend to be for very late stage cancer patients - patients that are very close to the end of their life, who live one month longer than they would have. It's very rare that we see drugs approved to treat early stage cancers or to prevent cancer.  "There were about 12,000 clinical trials to treat late stage cancer patients, relative to about 6,000 for healthier cancer patients and about 500 for cancer prevention.  "For cancer 'effective' usually means evidence that your drug improves survival relative to a control group. For patients with very advanced cancers you only need a relatively short clinical trial in order to document evidence that people in your treatment group live longer.  "For patients with, say, localised breast cancer who are relatively healthier, you would need a much longer clinical trial in order to show evidence that your drug reduces mortality rates.  "That difference in clinical trial lengths matters because longer trials are more expensive and take more time.  "Also pharmaceutical firms almost always file for patent protection before starting clinical trials, [so] drugs that require longer clinical trials receive shorter effective patent terms, because more of the term is eaten up during clinical trials.  "The conclusion we come to is that incentives seem to matter. We might want to think about more public funding on early stage cancers or on cancer prevention, relative to public funding on later stage cancers, where the private sector is more likely to come in and provide that research investment.  "We estimate that trying to address this distortion between private incentives and social incentives could have a really important impact on patient survival."  Dr Christopher Wild is director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the specialist cancer agency of the World Health Organisation.  "At the moment, perhaps 40 to 50% of cancers could be prevented - if we were able to translate the knowledge we have about what causes cancer into effective interventions and reduce exposure to those risk factors.  "It's worth adding as well that the pattern of cancer and risk factors is quite different in different parts of the world.  "Typically in the low-income countries we see quite a lot of cancers associated with chronic infections, so cervical cancer, associated with the Human papillomavirus, liver cancer associated with Hepatitis B virus and stomach cancer, which is linked to a bacterium in the gut.  "What we're seeing is the addition of cancers now which are more common in high-income industrialised countries, such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer, prostate cancer. If you look at a country's progression in relation to colorectal cancer rates, those two things go up together. It's almost as if colorectal cancer is a good index of development.  "What's allocated to prevention is typically 2 to 3% of the overall budget, so it's quite low.  "It's a complex mixture of reasons. You can make money out of getting more effective treatments, and that's not so obvious with prevention, and I think one of our challenges is to demonstrate the economic value of cancer prevention.  "I think it is beginning to change, partly because there's an increasing recognition at a political level that no country can afford to treat its way out of the cancer problem.  "We've got around 14 million new cases per year at the moment, and we project forward to about 24 million new cancer cases every year by 2035, so the costs of treating those cancer patients are spiralling.  "I hope that political understanding will translate to a different approach to cancer control generally. Trying to prevent the disease in the first place is a necessary complement to the advances in treatment we're also aiming at."  Professor Pekka Puska is a former director general of the Finnish National Institution for Health and Welfare. As a young public health academic he led a landmark project to tackle heart disease in North Karelia.  "The mortality rate of heart disease among men was the highest in the world. The blood cholesterol levels were record high, due to the very high fat diet. [They ate] little fruit and vegetables, blood pressure levels were high, men smoked a lot.  "They had a big breakfast, putting an enormous amount of butter on bread, tea and coffee with cream, and then during the day the meals were potato with bread with a lot of butter. Then fatty meat prepared fried with butter. It was fairly typical that the man had a packet of butter every day.  "Changing behaviour is not easy. There is inertia. Lifestyles are related to habits, local culture, local environment and there are a whole range of commercial and financial interests.  "There is no magic bullet, [but] you can change your lifestyle, your diet, you can stop smoking. Information was the first part.  "The housewives were worried about their men, so they were powerful in persuading the men to change their diet, even if they were resistant. They started to mix non-fat milk with the fatty milk so the husbands didn't realise.  "There was a popular dish called Karelian stew, which was covered with white fat. Together we changed the recipe so it had more lean meat, less salt. They started to call it Puska's stew.  "There were anti-smoking and cholesterol-lowering competitions between villages.  "The dairy industry became worried because sales of butter started to reduce, and in the 1980s there were some big events against us with political support, so it wasn't easy.  "But when people started to see the results of cholesterol levels lowering and heart disease mortality starting to decline that reinforced the development.  "We calculated that if the cardiovascular mortality levels had stayed on the level that they were in 1972, something like a quarter of a million people below 75 would have died of cardiovascular disease.  "Because smoking among men was such a tremendous problem, the annual mortality of lung cancer, tobacco-related cancers have now declined by close to 50 per cent.  "All this led to something like a 10-year increase in life expectancy."  The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.	health

Dame Sally Davies said when she reaches for a glass of wine she questions whether she wants the wine or to raise her risk of breast cancer.  Speaking at a science and technology committee hearing, she urged other people to do the same.  It comes as official UK figures show alcohol-related deaths are rising.  Although alcohol-related deaths have fallen since peaking in 2008, experts are concerned the rates are going up again.  Data published by the Office for National Statistics show there were 8,697 alcohol-related deaths registered in the UK in 2014 - 14.3 per 100,000 of the population.  This compares to 14 deaths per 100,000 in 2013.  Dame Sally said: "I would like people to make their choice knowing the issues and do as I do when I reach for my glass of wine and think, 'Do I want my glass of wine or do I want to raise my risk of breast cancer?'. And I take a decision each time I have a glass."  Recent changes to official guidelines recommend both men and women should have no more than 14 units of alcohol spread over a few days.  The changes came about because of mounting evidence that there is no safe limit in terms of health risks such as cancer.  Previously limits were set at 21 units for men and 14 units for women per week.  Tom Smith, of charity Alcohol Concern, said: "These latest figures show that alcohol-related deaths are back on the rise.  "The figures also highlight the dangers of middle-aged drinking, with the highest number of alcohol-related deaths among 55 to 64-year olds."  Dame Sally Davies was speaking at a committee meeting to discuss the new guidelines among other health issues.  Public Health England experts say they are putting together a report on how to reduce the harms caused by alcohol.	health

Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the move would allow local authorities to "help struggling High Streets".  He told MPs the policy, previously reported to be facing strong opposition in the Commons, would be added to the government's Enterprise Bill.  Unions said ministers were "behaving disgracefully by trying to change Sunday trading by the back door".  Devolving Sunday trading laws to councils was first announced by George Osborne in the July Budget, and a consultation into the change closed in September.  Small shops - up to 280 sq m - are currently entitled to open when they want, but on Sundays, larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00.  In the Commons, Mr Javid's Labour shadow Angela Eagle criticised the way the government was seeking to make the change and as well as what she said was a lack of detail.  She accused Mr Javid of a "gross abuse of power" asking why the plans were being added "at this late stage" rather than being in the Bill from the start.  Mr Javid said the government's intentions "have been clear" and said amending the Enterprise Bill, which is currently making its way through the Commons, was "the right vehicle to make those changes".  He told MPs the decision to change Sunday trading hours would be "entirely local", adding: "If the people of Bromsgrove or Barking say they want to see longer Sunday opening hours, who are we here in Westminster to stand in their way?"  Under the proposals, local authorities will be able to restrict the longer hours to certain zones - such as High Streets and city centres, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.  It promised that shop workers who wanted to "opt out" of working on Sundays would be able to do so, for example on religious or family grounds.  The response to the consultation would be published "shortly", the government said.  Retail union Usdaw said MPs should be able to "properly consider" the views expressed in the consultation.  General secretary John Hannett described the current Sunday Trading Act as a "great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.  "Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family."	politics

Brazil has reported around 4,000 cases of microcephaly since October - an unprecedented number.  The World Health Organization has declared a global public health emergency in response.  But experts are unsure what exactly is behind the rise.  Dr Anthony Costello, the WHO's expert on microcephaly, says finding an answer quickly is imperative.  "We must assume, given global travel and the like, that this could spread into many other populations as well.  "What we have picked up is a surge in cases of microcephaly in two areas where Zika virus has broken out. First in French Polynesia last year and now, to a much greater extent, in Brazil.  "We do not know about cases yet in other areas."  Zika virus has now hit more than 20 countries and the WHO believes it is likely to spread "explosively" across nearly all of the Americas, making the need for fast answers clear.  Dr Costello says there will be a lag time of several months to know if pregnant women in these newly affected countries are safe.  The race is on to find a better diagnostic test and a vaccine and treatment for Zika as well as establishing what is making these babies ill.  Microcephaly is not a new condition. In the US, official reports suggests two to 12 babies per 10,000 born each year have microcephaly - that's around 25,000 babies a year.  It can be caused by other infections caught in pregnancy, such as rubella.  Drug and alcohol abuse by expectant mothers are also factors.  And it can also be caused by rare genetic conditions.  The difficulty facing scientists is establishing what is behind each new case.  Research using animal models is needed to determine if Zika causes damage to an unborn infant when infection occurs in pregnancy and at what stage, as well as studies of pregnant women who have unfortunately been infected with Zika virus to determine the outcomes of their pregnancies.  Dr Costello said: "We desperately need to have better diagnostics for Zika virus so that we can look very carefully, if you get pregnant and you get infected, at what is the risk of getting microcephaly.  "At the moment we don't exactly know what the risk is."  He said although many pregnant women would, understandably, be very scared at the moment, they should remember that the risk of their baby having microcephaly was still very low.  "This is still a relatively rare occurrence and even if the rates increase, most women are going to get through pregnancy absolutely fine."  Babies born with microcephaly can grow up to have few or no complications. The impact it will have on their life depends on its severity.  An underdeveloped brain can lead to seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, problems with movement and balance, hearing loss and visual problems.  Because it is difficult to predict at birth what problems may lie ahead for a baby with microcephaly, they need close medical follow-up.  There are things pregnant women, or those who are likely to be pregnant, can do to protect themselves against the potential risk:	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35460995	NHS England 'must monitor waits for autism diagnosis'	The amount of time it takes for autism to be diagnosed should be monitored by NHS England, the National Autistic Society (NAS) says.  The charity says delays between being referred to an autism specialist and diagnosis are "unacceptably long" and putting "families into crisis".  A report by Public Health England has shown there is a huge disparity in waiting times across England.  NHS England says it is committed to reducing waiting times.  The NAS says it can take on average over two years for children and adults to get a diagnosis, if the time it can take to get a referral from a GP is considered.  Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the NAS, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the situation had to change.  "At the moment people are waiting months - if not years - for a first appointment. If they're adults that might mean losing their job, if they're children they might be excluded from school. It can be really difficult.  "You can know that there's something wrong but not what. At least when you know, there's then a coping mechanism to deal with it, people know where to get support."  The Public Health England report, published last month, showed that some people in the South West of England were waiting as long as 95 weeks between a referral to an autism specialist and a diagnosis.  The wait was as long as 90 weeks in South East and 84 weeks in Yorkshire and Humber.  The median wait across England was 13 weeks. The national guidelines from NICE say the wait between referral and diagnosis should not exceed three months.  The NAS says an increase in autism awareness has led to more referrals, meaning there are huge delays in the system.  But it says the real issue stems from a lack of monitoring. The reasons for the delays could differ in each region and without monitoring of waiting times, it is hard to know why there are backlogs, and what is needed to fix the problem.  Ms Harris added: "The NHS needs to look at autism in the way it looks at other treatments - there's a waiting time for conditions from depression to hip operations."  An NHS England spokesman said: "Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders should of course happen as soon as possible, but is often complex and involves many different professionals and agencies.  "This is an issue we take very seriously and we have committed to working with local areas to identify and overcome the reasons behind long waiting times. We'll continue to work with NAS and others to make sure people with autism can get the help they need, when they need it".  A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "The guidelines on autism make it crystal clear that families should wait no more than three months to start diagnosis. Every bit of the NHS should be adhering to these guidelines and NHS England is working with local areas to make sure these waiting times are cut."  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

Experts are worried that the virus is spreading far and fast, with devastating consequences.  The infection has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.  The WHO alert puts Zika in the same category of concern as Ebola.  It means research and aid will be fast-tracked to tackle the infection.  WHO director general, Margaret Chan called Zika an "extraordinary event" that needed a coordinated response.  "I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern."  She said the priorities were to protect pregnant women and their babies from harm and to control the mosquitoes that are spreading the virus.  Dr Chan justified declaring an emergency even amid uncertainties about the disease, saying it was time to take action.  The WHO faced heavy criticism for waiting too long to declare the Ebola outbreak a public emergency.  Currently, there is no vaccine or medication to stop Zika. The only way to avoid catching it is to avoid getting bitten by the Aedes mosquitoes that transmit the infection.  The WHO has already warned that Zika is likely to "spread explosively" across nearly all of the Americas. More than 20 countries, including Brazil, are reporting cases.  Most infections are mild and cause few or no symptoms, although there have been some reported cases of a rare paralysis disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.  The bigger health threat though is believed to be in pregnancy, to the unborn child.  There have been around 4,000 reported cases of microcephaly - babies born with small brains - in Brazil alone since October.  Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "There is a long road ahead. As with Ebola, Zika has once again exposed the world's vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases and the devastation they can unleash. Alongside the emergency response that Zika necessitates, we must put in place the permanent reforms, health systems strengthening and proactive research agenda that are needed to make the global health system more resilient to the threat of future pandemics."

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35443961	Zika crisis: World Health Organization in emergency talks	An emergency meeting of the World Health Organization is being held to discuss the "explosive" spread of the Zika virus.  The meeting in Geneva will decide whether to declare a global emergency.  WHO officials have described Zika as moving "from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions".  Most cases will have no symptoms but the virus has been linked to brain abnormalities in thousands of babies in Brazil.  Meanwhile in the country, officials have been given permission to break into properties that could be harbouring mosquito breeding grounds.  They will be able to force entry when the place is abandoned or when nobody is there to give access to the house.  Declaring a "public health emergency of international concern" would establish Zika as a serious global threat and lead to money, resources and scientific expertise being thrown at the problem both in South America and in laboratories around the world.  The WHO's actions are under intense scrutiny after its handling of the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.  Its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus were widely criticised and it was deemed to have been too slow to declare an emergency.  Prof Peter Piot, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: "WHO clearly dropped the ball responding to the Ebola crisis, it took about five months to declare Ebola in West Africa a public health emergency."  "By any means this [Zika] is a public health emergency with the sheer numbers of people who are coming down with a flu-like syndrome, but particularly the complications."  What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread  Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do  The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the mosquito involved  Media reflect fears over virus Press in Latin America ask searching questions  At the meeting, experts in disease control, virology and vaccine development will brief WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan.  Last week, she said: "The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.  "Questions abound - we need to get some answers quickly.  "For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an emergency committee.  "I am asking the committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere."  Since the mosquito-borne disease was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, the virus has spread to more than 20 countries.  The biggest concern is the surge in levels of microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads - and the rare nervous system disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.  The link between the virus and these disorders has not been confirmed, but Dr Chan said it was "strongly suspected" and was "deeply alarming".  And she warned the situation could yet deteriorate as "this year's El Nino weather patterns are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas".  The WHO has already predicted that four million people could be infected with Zika in the Americas this year.  An announcement on whether Zika constitutes a global emergency is not expected until at least Tuesday.  The WHO could also make recommendations on travel to the affected countries, tracking the spread of Zika, best practice for treating patients or efforts to fast-track the development of vaccines and cures.

While there is close scrutiny of everything from accident and emergency unit waiting times to access to the latest cancer drugs, the support - or rather lack of it - care home residents receive from the NHS has gone almost unnoticed.  But, on Monday morning, the issue bubbled to the surface following a front-page article by the Daily Mail headlined "GPs vote to axe care home visits".  Although, many care home residents and their families would say this is old news, as GPs have long since stopped visiting care homes.  A quick review of the sector in 2012, by the Care Quality Commission, found most of the 81 care homes looked at were not receiving regular visits from GPs .  And it is pretty safe to assume the situation hasn't improved.  These are among the frailest, most vulnerable members of society.  Many are living with a complex range of conditions, including dementia, heart disease and diabetes, with residents on an average of nine medications each.  And yet they are going without the sort of basic health care most take for granted.  Like many problems not given the coverage they perhaps deserve, the issue has been developing gradually over time.  The closure of long-stay NHS beds over the past 20 years or so has meant a cohort of needy, frail people have disappeared from view from the health service.  Before they move into a home, these people will probably be among a GP's most frequent visitors.  But when they enter a care home, their ability to get down to the local practice diminishes.  They may even move out of the local area.  And GPs, who argue they are struggling to cope with the day-to-day demands placed on them, quickly get consumed by the patients turning up at their door.  Find out more about care at the BBC's cost of care website.  Use the BBC's care calculator to find out how much care costs where you live.  This has caused many care-home managers to take extreme measures.  Faced with caring for residents with increasingly complex conditions, they've started paying retainers to GPs to provide regular visits.  These fees can sometimes top £20,000 a year.  Care England, which represents providers, and charities such as Age UK have being trying to raise the alarm for some years.  But, as care-home residents tend not to live that long once they reach the stage where they need round-the-clock care and given their extreme frailty, the human stories that often grab the attention are not always heard.  There are signs things could be changing, however, and, as always, the driver is money.  Care-home residents are an estimated 50% more likely than the average older person to be admitted in an emergency to hospital.  This costs the NHS money, and so health bosses have started looking at new ways to ensure they receive the health care they need.  There are six pilot areas in NHS England's vanguard programme, looking at how GPs, specialist nurses and hospital doctors can work more closely with care homes.  Ideas include extra GPs being taken on to provide regular "ward rounds" and hospital consultants running clinics either face to face or via digital technologies such as Skype.  In fact, if you examine the detail behind Monday morning's story, GPs are actually calling for the responsibility for care-home residents to become a distinct and separate part of their contract.  That, of course, would require extra investment.  And while some may be critical of GPs wanting more money, others are just happy to see the topic aired.	health

Angela Eagle told The Sunday Times the plan to ban such firms from paying dividends was "not a runner".  The idea was criticised as "silly" by Labour economic adviser David Blanchflower, in the New Statesman.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the criticisms would be taken on board in the party's policy review.  Mr Corbyn floated the idea of banning profitable firms who "depend on cheap labour for those profits" from paying dividends to shareholders in a speech earlier this month.  Ms Eagle, who heads Labour's National Policy Forum, said companies should be encouraged to act more fairly, but "a ban on dividends is not the way to do it".  She told The Sunday Times: "It is an interesting idea, but it does not actually work."  Asked to respond to her comments on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Mr McDonnell said "that's why it's open for discussion".  The government is set to increase the current minimum wage, which rose to £6.70 an hour last year, to a £9 an hour for over 25s by the end of the decade.  It will be rebranded as a National Living Wage, but Labour argues it will still be below the level full time workers need to afford a decent standard of living.  Mr McDonnell said he planned to bring in a legally enforceable "real living wage" when Labour came to power.  "But in the meantime, we want to campaign with shareholders so that they pressurise their companies to abide by a real living wage and I think there is an alliance to be built there," he added.  Responding to criticism from David Blanchflower, who is a member of Labour's economic advisory panel, Mr McDonnell said "we will listen to his advice and take it on board".  Mr Blanchflower said the new Labour leadership had to "learn fast" about the realities of capitalism and stop suggesting "silly stuff" such as the dividends ban.  In a separate development, Lord Mandelson has accused Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters of declaring war on "decent Labour party members" who do not share their values.  He denied there was a civil war going on in the Labour Party but said many of those who back Mr Corbyn are now wondering if he is up to the job.  The former minister, who served in government under two Labour prime ministers said he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is "unsupportable" by the public, and is failing to put "fear" into the Conservatives.  Speaking to BBC South West, he said: "People sense that we just don't have credible policies and certainly not a leader they'd like to see as prime minister.  "And certainly if we fight the election in 2020 as we are now then my fear would be that we would face a very disappointing result.  "But there's time to go between now and then. And time for the party to make up his mind what it wants to do."  He added: "For Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters to turn around and say for people who disagree with them, that they are just Tories, that's not just insulting, that is actually very divisive, and a declaration of war by them on many decent Labour party members who share Labour party values."	politics

The details of Mr McDonnell's earnings and tax, which amounted to £61,575 and £14,253 respectively, were published in the Sunday Mirror.  His disclosure comes amid a row over a government deal for Google to pay £130m in tax dating back to 2005.  Despite criticism, Mr Osborne has said the agreement is a "major success".  But Mr McDonnell said "we can't tell" whether it was a success " because we haven't got the information".  "I want the information on how this deal was arrived at and I want them in future to be able to publish the tax records," he told the BBC's Sunday Politics.  He called for an international action to prevent companies "shopping around the world to find the lowest tax regimes and then inventing their company structures to enable that to happen".  But he added "the reputational damage to Google, I think, is immense," and he suggested the "saving they have made in tax is not worth the reputation damage they have had".  In the Sunday Mirror, Mr McDonnell wrote that the government's deal with Google had "created a lack of confidence" in the tax system.  He said taxpayers filling in their returns, due by midnight, would be "feeling angry".  He wrote: "The chancellor, the politician with sole responsibility for setting taxation, should be open and transparent about their own income.  "That is why in the spirit of the 'new politics' I have taken the decision to publish my personal tax returns.  "And I will do so every year while I seek to be and hopefully one day become chancellor.  "I think it is only fair that politicians set a good example."  Mr McDonnell has also written to Mr Osborne asking for more details of the tax deal with Google.  In the letter, he wrote: "As you will be well aware, many are concerned about the outcome and, indeed, the process by which the decision was made."  He wants to know whether Google has paid the Diverted Profits Tax, which is designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax, and the basis for the deal.  Earlier this week, the European Commission said it was considering how to respond to a letter of complaint from the SNP about Google's tax deal with the UK.  Google agreed to pay £130m of tax to HMRC, which said it was the "full tax due in law".  Prime Minister David Cameron defended the deal, saying the Conservatives had done more than any other government.  But European MPs have described it as a "very bad deal", and Labour said it amounted to a 3% tax rate.	politics

Up to 10 million people around the world are living with Parkinson's disease, which causes symptoms such as a shuffling walk and tremor in the hands.  But researchers in the UK hope that a phone app, which records a patient's movement and voice patterns, could help their doctor to monitor their progress more accurately.  The app includes seven different tests - for tremor, walking gait, reaction times and voice.  Dr Fahd Baig, clinical researcher at the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, says that there are tell-tale signs in the voice of a Parkinson's patient.  Results from one of his pilot studies indicate that simply getting a patient to say "ahhh" into a phone means the app can spot this with 99% sensitivity.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35440016	Proton beam cancer therapy 'effective with fewer side effects'	A cancer treatment at the centre of an NHS controversy in 2014 causes fewer side effects in children than conventional radiotherapy, according to new research.  The study, published in The Lancet Oncology, suggests proton beam therapy is as effective as other treatments.  Researchers looked at 59 patients aged between three and 21 from 2003 to 2009.  In 2014 the parents of Ashya King took him out of hospital in Hampshire to get the treatment abroad.  Their actions led to a police operation to find them.  Ashya, who was five at the time of his treatment, is now cancer free, his family said last year.  All the patients who took part in the study, led by Dr Torunn Yock from the Massachusetts General Hospital in the US, had the most common kind of malignant brain tumour in children, known as medulloblastoma.  After five years, their survival rate was similar to that of patients treated with conventional X-ray radiotherapy, but there were fewer side effects to the heart and lungs, the study found.  Dr Yock told BBC Radio 5 live: "The major finding is that proton therapy is as effective as photon therapy [conventional X-ray radiotherapy] in curing these patients and what is also very exciting is that it is maintaining these high rates of cure but doing so with less late toxicity, which has dramatic quality of life improvements."  The paper said: "Proton radiotherapy resulted in acceptable toxicity and had similar survival outcomes to those noted with conventional radiotherapy, suggesting that the use of the treatment may be an alternative to photon-based treatments."  It uses charged particles instead of X-rays to deliver radiotherapy for cancer patients.  The treatment allows high-energy protons to be targeted directly at a tumour, reducing the dose to surrounding tissues and organs.  In general, it gives fewer side effects compared with high-energy X-ray treatments.  It can be used to treat spinal cord tumours, sarcomas near the spine or brain, prostate cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and some children's cancers.  Independent expert Prof Gillies McKenna, who is the head of the department of oncology at the University of Oxford, said the research suggested that the "side effects are indeed dramatically reduced" with proton beam therapy.  "There were no side effects seen in the heart and lungs and gastrointestinal tract, which are almost always seen with X-rays, and no secondary cancers were seen at a time when we would have expected to see them in X-ray treated patients," he added.  But Dr Kieran Breen, from Brain Tumour Research, said there was still more research needed into the treatment.  "In the longer term, we need to try and understand what effects it will have on people and there are many other forms of tumour both in the brain and in other parts of the body," he said.  Proton beam therapy is currently only available in the UK to treat eye cancers, but patients with other forms of cancer can apply for NHS funding for the therapy abroad.  The first proton beam facility in the UK is due to be made available in Newport by the end of 2016, as a "result of direct investment by the Welsh government," according to a Welsh Assembly spokesman.  The Department of Health has said that from April 2018 the treatment will be offered to up to 1,500 cancer patients at hospitals in London and Manchester, following investment worth £250m.  Two years ago a dispute about the use of the treatment prompted Brett and Naghemeh King, of Southsea, Hampshire, to remove their son Ashya from a hospital in Southampton against his doctors' advice.  The parents wanted their five-year-old to undergo proton beam therapy in Prague, which had not been recommended by his care team in Southampton.  Their actions sparked an international police manhunt, and the couple were later arrested and held in a prison in Madrid.  They were eventually released and Ashya's therapy took place, with the NHS later agreeing to pay for it.  A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said that medulloblastoma was not currently on the list of tumours approved for this treatment on the NHS.  "However, we welcome any update to the existing clinical evidence on cancer treatments and will follow any expansion of the current national criteria," a spokesman added.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35293178	Is Bernie Sanders the American Jeremy Corbyn?	He is the veteran socialist that no one gave a prayer to - but now Bernie Sanders is starting to be seen as a serious contender to be the Democrats' presidential candidate. Does that remind you of anyone?  A self-declared "democratic socialist" - a rare beast indeed in American politics - the 74-year-old Vermont senator has stunned the Democrat establishment by emerging from nowhere to challenge Hillary Clinton to be the party's candidate for the White House in November's general election.  He has to win the Democratic nomination before he can think about winning the White House.  The polls suggest he is in with a chance of victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first stage in the marathon process by which American parties select their presidential candidates. And he is ahead in the polls in the next primary, eight days later in New Hampshire. But Hillary Clinton, the establishment candidate, retains a comfortable lead in national polls of Democrat supporters, and most pundits think that when the contest heads into the larger states, the Sanders campaign will falter. It would be hard to see how a rank outsider, with no track record in government, could actually win this thing.  The comparisons are irresistible. They are both silver-haired socialists who rail against inequality and the political establishment - and make the style police despair. Few outside of politics had heard of them this time last year. Both men were reluctant to enter their respective contests and did not think they stood a chance of winning, but thought it might give a voice to the Left, as Sanders confessed to Politico in March.  "There are obvious connections between the Bernie and Jeremy candidacies," said Larry Sanders, Bernie's older brother, a Green Party activist who lives in Oxfordshire, when he spoke to the BBC's Esther Webber last summer. "They support similar policies; their central theme is the reversal of the redistribution of wealth and income from the majority to the very richest people."  Sanders is a famously grouchy, old school Noo Yawker. The Washington Post described him as a "member of the 'get off my lawn' caucus" in a piece entitled Seven Ways Bernie Sanders Reminds us of our grumpy grandpa. Jeremy Corbyn is every bit as earnest as Sanders, with no time for "personality politics", but he comes across as a more mild-mannered individual. More geography teacher than angry cab driver.  Like Corbyn in last summer's Labour contest, Sanders makes a point of avoiding personal attacks saying he wants to concentrate on the issues. They both cut their campaigning teeth in the anti-war movements. Sanders has more experience of running things than Corbyn, having served three terms as the independent mayor of Burlington, a small city in liberal Vermont, in the 1980s, before becoming the first Independent to be elected to the US House of Representatives in 40 years. Corbyn had never sought office of any kind before, other than his seat in Parliament, but unlike Sanders he has always been a party man.  "I have to admit, I'm not the hippest guy around," Sanders told CNN this week. But for his thousands of young supporters at rallies and on social media that may be the point. The Millennials, as the generation who came of age after the 2008 financial crash are known, are disillusioned with politics as it is currently practiced and for many, it seems, Sanders offers something radically different and appealing. Jeremy Corbyn tapped into a similar feeling last year among young left-wingers in the UK, and like Sanders, ran a highly effective social media campaign. Corbyn supporters rallied round the twitter hashtag #JezWeCan. Sanders fans have got #FeelTheBern.  "At a time of mass income and wealth inequality throughout the world, I am delighted to see that the British Labour Party has elected Jeremy Corbyn as its new leader," Sanders told the Huffington Post in September last year. "We need leadership in every country in the world which tells the billionaire class that they cannot have it all."  Asked in September last year, before he had won the Labour leadership, whether he disliked America, given his attacks on US foreign policy, Mr Corbyn told the BBC: "Absolutely not. I have been there many times and I have many friends in the USA and, indeed, I am following Bernie Sanders' campaign with great interest and, indeed, we are exchanging leaflets and badges and things like that. It's great."  The most common criticism of Sanders is that he is "extreme" and "unelectable". "How about this guy - this socialist Bernie Sanders? This guy's a total whack job," said Republican frontrunner Donald Trump at a rally last month. He has also been accused by main Democratic opponent Hilary Clinton of "flip-flopping" on gun control, something he firmly denies. Some of this will sound familiar to Jeremy Corbyn (apart from the gun control issue, of course).  Sanders describes himself as a socialist - seen as a pretty daring thing to do in a country where the term is usually an insult. But he has been careful to distance himself from Marxism or, indeed, communism, saying: "I don't believe government should own the means of production". Corbyn comes from a different left-wing tradition, where such ideas are standard. They share a commitment to tackling inequality through higher taxes on the wealthy. But Sanders' call for universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage and subsidised higher education are hardly radical by British standards. Sanders has expressed doubt over the need for America to have thousands of new nuclear warheads but, unlike Corbyn, he is no unilateralist. That really would be political suicide for a would-be American president and Commander in Chief.  With Donald Trump surging in the Republican polls, it is clearly a great time to be a maverick in American politics. The Clinton/Blair era of safe, "centre ground" politics appears to be over on both sides of the Atlantic. But it is dangerous to make too many comparisons between Sanders and Corbyn. Labour's seemingly endless leadership contest was a stroll in the park compared with the gruelling war of attrition that is the US primary season. Corbyn only had to win one election - Sanders has to keep on winning and that will be tough. But unlike his British counterpart he will, at least, be guaranteed a shot at leading his party into a general election straight away, if he succeeds. Corbyn has another four years to go.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35446021	NHS: Surging patient numbers	The numbers arriving in accident and emergency units have surged.  Calls to the NHS 111 helpline have been a lot higher than the same time last year. Yet the weather has not been unusual for winter and norovirus and flu numbers are nothing out of the ordinary.  So what's going on? Nobody, it seems, has a very clear answer.  The weekly NHS England figures (ending 24 January) reveal an 8% year-on-year increase in attendances at major A&E units.  Calls to 111 were 20% higher than the same week last year.  A Welsh government spokesman said there had been a sharp rise in the number of people seeking treatment in emergency departments.  It seems to have been a similar picture in Scotland, though with some improvement on last winter according to its government.  This week the pressures don't seem to have eased, though we don't yet have the detailed data. There were reports of an "extremely serious situation" at one hospital which had to cancel all routine operations and appointments, apart from cancer surgery, for two days.  GPs in north London were told that two local hospitals were experiencing "very high pressure on beds" which created a "significant challenge to safe operating". Practices were asked to consider using alternative options for their patients including walk-in centres.  It adds up to a service under even greater pressure than most had expected. NHS England noted there had been bad weather last week, which might have accounted for some of the increase in patient numbers.  But while paying tribute to the "remarkable" job done by staff in providing high quality services, NHS chiefs acknowledged the "very real" pressures which were not expected to ease in the run-up to spring.  Heads of emergency departments point out there has not been a sudden new spike in numbers of people coming through their doors. They argue that there has been a steadily increasing trend going back a couple of years.  Familiar factors are quoted, including numbers of frail, elderly patients with multiple conditions needing an increasing range of care and treatment.  One specialist in geriatric medicine told me more older patients were coming into A&E because of problems with care in their home. This could be because social care was lacking in some way, or because a spouse had become unable to cope.  But the surge in hospital attendances was by no means dominated by the over-65s.  One theory being put forward is that A&E is a well-regarded "brand" amongst the public and is trusted to deliver high quality care even with a wait.  This could tie in with people feeling that their local GP practice is overburdened and a perception that appointments are not easy to get. In a 24/7 culture people increasingly expect instant service, including from the NHS.  Winters are always busy in the NHS and there are always difficult weeks. This one is unusual because of the scale of the increase in demand.  If one thing is clear, it is that people are not getting the message to avoid A&E and go elsewhere unless it's a genuine emergency.

It suggests the four-hour target to treat or admit patients is proving difficult to achieve - hospitals are meant to see 95% of patients in that timeframe.  To find out more about why hospitals are under so much pressure have a watch of the video below.  So what else do we know? Well, the picture is complicated because the way official data is collected varies in different parts of the UK.  With the exception of Scotland, the figures provided by the NHS lag behind the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's data by between four and six weeks.  Nonetheless, we can still draw out an interesting picture of what is happening.  Unlike previous years, the NHS is not publishing weekly data on how it is performing against the four-hour target.  Instead this is now being released monthly. The latest figures for November showed 91.3% of patients were seen in four hours. This sort of performance is normally seen in the depths of winter.  Other key targets are also being missed.  As winter has progressed there are signs the difficulties have increased. In the past weeks there have been reports of hospitals going on black alert - this is an indication for the reset of the system that a site is under strain and struggling to cope. A hospital on black alert may be taking extraordinary steps such as cancelling non-emergency operations and re-deploying staff.  Hospitals seem to be having a particular problem with discharging patients. The most vulnerable patients - mainly elderly, frail people - need to have support in place in the community from council care teams and community nursing before they can be released, even though they may be medically fit to leave hospital.  When this cannot be found, the patients are classed as a delayed discharge. The number of delays has now reached the highest level since record-keeping began in 2010. Reports suggest some hospitals may have a fifth of their beds taken up by patients who should not be there.  Analysis: A 'good' Christmas for the NHS - but what's to come?  Analysis: Why the NHS needs better-behaved patients  A&E nurse: It's like a complex game of chess  Out of the four UK nations, Northern Ireland is doing the worst. The graph below shows its performance, according to the official statistics, against the rest of the UK nations for November - the latest month for which there is complete data.  Northern Ireland also provides data on 12-hour waits. A total of 288 patients waited this long, double the number 12 months previously.  By the start of 2016 health chiefs were warning that the system was under severe pressure and patients should only head to A&E in an emergency.  Wales has experienced its share of problems too. A&E performance is better than in Northern Ireland, but still some way short of what is being achieved in England and Scotland.  In November the official figures showed just over 81% of patients were seen in four hours. By early January reports were emerging of "unprecedented demands" being placed on hospitals and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said A&Es were "on the edge".  But it is not just A&E units that are struggling. Like England, other parts of the system are under pressure.  The number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, has been growing. Latest figures show there are nearly 450,000 - 10% higher than it was three years ago.  The Royal College of Surgeons recently described this as "unacceptable" and urged ministers to address the problems.  But Wales has unveiled plans to help it cope including a push on reducing admissions and delays discharging patients.  Out of all the four nations, Scotland is arguably in the best position. It is the only health service that is actually doing better than last year.  The latest monthly performance figure shows 94.9% of patients were seen in four hours.  And this position seems to be holding up. Scotland provides up-to-date information on the performance of the 30 busiest hospitals on a weekly basis. The data over Christmas shows performance was actually just above the 96% mark although by early January there were signs winter was starting to hit performance.  Councils and the NHS have been encouraged to pool budgets and a number of places have opened up intermediate care beds.  This appears to have led to a reduction in the delayed discharges that have proved so problematic in England.  In Glasgow, for example, about 100 beds have been opened for this purpose over the past year.  The impact has been staggering. On the first Monday of December last winter 117 hospital patients had been waiting more than 72 hours to be discharged. This winter there were 27.	health

The BBC has learnt some NHS trusts have even had to take extreme measures to cope with the "exceptional" pressures.  One hospital had to cancel all its routine operations, while another considered setting up a temporary treatment area in a tent.  Over the past fortnight there have been 45 temporary closures of A&E units - up 50% on the same period last year.  This is considered an extreme step in which ambulances are sent to other hospitals and is ordered when wards are full and waiting times increasing rapidly.  The number of patients visiting A&Es in England jumped by 20,000 last week to nearly 340,000 - well above the average for winter.  As well as a rise in visits to A&E, hospitals bosses are also reporting problems discharging patients.  NHS England warned the pressures would last to the spring.  Among the problems reported were:  Special report page: For the latest news, analysis and video  Winter across the UK: A guide to how the NHS is coping  Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure  Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt  Coventry University Hospital's chief executive, Andy Hardy, said this week had been "incredibly difficult".  "I would like to apologise to any patients who have been affected."  The pressures built during Tuesday when more than 500 patients turned up at A&E, leading to the unprecedented step of cancelling all the routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, that had been planned for Wednesday and Thursday.  Mr Hardy said the trust had large numbers of patients in the hospital who did not need to be there but could not be discharged because there were "no spaces" in the community.  Leicester's clinical director for emergency medicine Dr Ian Lawrence said the numbers coming in had "rocketed" since the start of January.  "Almost every bed in our three hospitals is being used and many staff members have voluntarily done extra shifts to help out," he added.  Dr Cliff Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the NHS was reaching a "critical point" in winter.  "We were beginning to think this winter would not be as bad as last winter, but the problems we are beginning to see suggest it could end up being worse.  "We have virtually no flu or norovirus [a vomiting bug which leads to mass ward closures] - if there was to be an outbreak of either we could see the whole system tip over."  NHS England's Richard Barker said the recent bad weather was likely to have contributed to the "sharp rise" in A&E visits.  "The pressures remain very real. We don't expect those to abate in the run-up to spring," he added.  Elsewhere in the UK significant problems have been reported - last week doctors in Wales warned A&E was "on the edge".	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35444244	Week ahead	It's probably a bit early to be talking about a zombie Parliament, but the coming Westminster week, with a surfeit of uncontroversial legislation, Opposition Days and Backbench debates, does recall the dog days of the last Parliament.  Of course the agenda can be livened-up, at short notice, by ministerial statements or urgent questions, and there are a number of very big issues coming down the track (the date of the EU referendum, the mammoth Investigatory Powers Bill, the Trident vote) but the current quiet in Westminster leaves plenty of time for leadership speculation and euro-plotting.  Here's my rundown of the week's events:  The Commons opens at 2.30pm, with Work and Pensions questions, after which any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will be taken.  The day's main legislating is the second reading of the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill - this deals with the governance, transparency and accountability of the Bank of England, as well as updating resolution planning and crisis management arrangements between the Bank and the Treasury.  It extends the senior managers and certification regime across the whole financial services industry and it extends the scope of the Pension Wise guidance service.  Of all the scheduled events this week (there's no accounting for urgent questions or statements) the backbench debate on the future of the Financial Conduct Authority looks the most interesting; a cross party team of Guto Bebb (Conservative), John Mann (Labour) and Kirsten Oswald (SNP) has put down a motion of no confidence in the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, saying it is not fit for purpose.  This is a pretty unprecedented move - I'm told the Commons clerks have been searching for a precedent without reward - I wonder if they've got back to the Honourable East India Company yet. It was sparked by the FCA's handling of a number of controversies, over interest rate swaps, and the management of the Connaught Income Fund (nearly 50 MPs - an impressive number - attended a recent adjournment debate on that issue) but most of all because the FCA has dropped plans for an inquiry into the culture of the financial services industry, a decision which has alarmed a number of MPs.  In Westminster Hall (from 4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 110776 on transitional state pension arrangements for women born in the 1950s: "The government must make fair transitional arrangements for all women born on or after 6th April 1951 who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State Pension Age (SPA). Hundreds of thousands of women have had significant changes imposed on them with a lack of appropriate notification." Helen Jones, the chair of the Petitions Committee, will lead the debate.  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) there's more committee stage debate on the Immigration Bill, where the key issues include immigration detention, "deport first appeal later", migrant support, and family reunion. The dinner break business is a short debate on the effects of neglected tropical diseases in impairing social and economic development in developing countries.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Business, Innovation and Skills questions, and that's followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem former Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael. His Mobile Telecommunications Network Coverage (Contractual Obligations) Bill aims to strengthen the rights of consumers who purchase mobile phone contracts which do not provide the advertised service; they're promised four bars of signal in his Orkney and Shetland constituency and get none.  After that, MPs have their first debate on the Enterprise Bill - which creates a Small Business Commissioner, to deal with late payment of bills. An estimated £27bn is owed to small and medium-sized businesses. The bill also has measures dealing with deregulation and apprenticeships.  In Westminster Hall the day's debates include regional airports and UK airports capacity (9.30am-11am) and gender pricing (4.30-5.30pm).  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) there will be ping-pong on two bills from the Commons: the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill - where no vote is expected, but key issues are housing and the Charity Commission. Then peers turn to ping-pong on the Childcare Bill - Labour is working on getting into scope a report on the effectiveness of the government's childcare proposals - and they may force that issue to a vote.  Then peers turn to an important statutory instrument: the Feed-in Tariffs (Amendment) Order, a measure which effectively cuts the subsidies to various forms of green energy; there's a Labour regret motion and a Lib Dem fatal motion, which Labour will abstain on.  The Commons opens at 11.30am, with International Development questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time - first in the batting order is Labour awkward squaddie John Mann, one of those behind Monday's debate on the FCA; anyone care to bet against him raising the issue with the PM?  PMQs is followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Automatic Electoral Registration, from the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, to ensure the accuracy of electoral registers. The bill proposes to automatically register everyone accessing a public service (that is everyone who applies for a driving license, everyone who has a National Insurance number, or receives a benefit), thereby making it much easier to keep an accurate and complete register.  She quotes estimates that the government's new system of Individual Voter Registration will lead to one million voters falling off the electoral register: the bill proposes to reverse this trend.  The day's main debates are on Labour motions on tax avoidance and multinational companies - and then on public finances in Scotland. And that's followed by an adjournment debate on child dental health, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford. Tooth decay is one of the main reasons young children arrive at A&E, and the House's resident dentist will explore the issue.  In Westminster Hall, the day's debates include: fuel poverty (9.30am- 11am); Bryan Evans and the Serious Fraud Office (11am- 11.30am); and government investment in cycling (4.30 -5.30pm).  My eye was caught by the debate on changes to the level of local government funding (2.30pm - 4pm). Former Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall will open a general debate, designed to encourage as many MPs as possible to raise their particular concerns about the future of local government in an era of austerity.  In the Lords, the main business is the continuation of detailed committee stage consideration of the Immigration Bill, where peers will be looking at the issues of unaccompanied refugee children, border security and language requirements for public sector workers. During the dinner break, the House will consider a Lib Dem regret motion on the Housing benefit, abolition of the Family Premium and Date of Claim Regulations. It's not expected to be pushed to a vote.  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions; then mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After the weekly Commons Business statement from the Leader of the House, the rest of the day is devoted to debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee.  First is a select committee statement from Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the committee's report The collapse of Kids Company: lessons for charity trustees, professional firms, the Charity Commission, and Whitehall.  Then comes debates on Parliamentary sovereignty and EU renegotiations and conflict in Yemen. On the first of those, the debate was applied for by the Conservative John Baron who believes the prime minister has not made a restoration of UK Parliamentary sovereignty a priority in his EU renegotiation.  "Without the restoration of sovereignty, everything else is peripheral," Mr Baron said. "We should by ourselves be able to stop unwanted directives, taxes and regulation. I look forward to the Government's response in the debate, given many of us have been unsuccessful in engaging with the Prime Minister."  The adjournment debate is on the Delay Repay scheme for rail commuters - led by the Lib Dem, Tom Brake.  The Westminster Hall debate (1.30pm) is on the role of men in preventing violence against women.  In the Lords, business in the Chamber begins at 11am - and the main event is the third reading of the Education and Adoption Bill - the key issue outstanding is the new regional schools commissioners created under the Bill.  Labour peer and human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy then leads debates on both the EU Committee's report Subsidiarity Assessment: Reform of the electoral law of the EU and on a reasoned opinion on the European Parliament's proposed decision on the election of MEPs. The final business in the Chamber is a debate on the EU Committee's report on Capital Markets Union: a welcome start.  It's another private members' bill day in the Commons (from 9.30am) opening with detailed consideration of the Conservative Mike Wood's Riot Compensation Bill, and then William Wragg's Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.  If those are completed (and there seems to be a consistent pattern of padding out these report stage debates) there might be a little time left to allow a mini-second reading debate on Peter Bone's Ovarian Cancer (Information) Bill, but I doubt Christopher Chope's Bat Habitats Regulation Bill will be reached.  One other Friday trend to watch out for is for the granting of urgent questions, which used to be quite a rarity on Fridays, when the Commons tends to be thinly-attended.  The Speaker's Office always insists that these are decided on merit, but I can't help wondering if some kind of message is being sent, about the increasing tendency to slip policy announcements out on a Thursday, when they might not be noticed by departing MPs.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35438049	UK 'world's worst' at breastfeeding	Rates of breastfeeding in the UK are the lowest in the world, an international study shows.  The data, published in the Lancet, shows that only one in 200 women - or 0.5% - are still doing any degree of breastfeeding after a year.  That compares to 23% in Germany, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal.  The researchers said it was a "widespread misconception" that breastfeeding was beneficial only in poor countries.  In the UK, 81% of mothers had tried breastfeeding at some point, but only 34% were breastfeeding at six months and 0.5% at 12 months.  It is the worst record in the world. Breastfeeding is far more common in developing countries, but the UK figures are behind even similar countries in Europe.  Women in the UK are advised to feed their baby exclusively on breast milk for the first six months and then a combination of breast milk and other foods.  Breastfeeding is good for the health of the baby and lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  Prof Cesar Victora, report author from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said: "There is a widespread misconception that the benefits of breastfeeding only relate to poor countries.  "Nothing could be further from the truth, our work clearly shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries, rich and poor alike."  The Lancet report said breastfeeding in developed countries reduced the risk of sudden infant deaths by more than a third.  And in poorer countries, half of cases of diarrhoea and a third of respiratory infections could be avoided by breastfeeding.  Overall, the report's authors said that near-universal breastfeeding could save over 800,000 children's lives a year.  A commentary, signed by Save the Children UK and the World Health Organization, was critical of formula milk being promoted at the expense of breastfeeding.  It said: "The active and aggressive promotion of breast milk substitutes by their manufacturers and distributors continues to be a substantial global barrier to breastfeeding.  "Promotion and marketing have turned infant formula, which should be seen as a specialised food that is vitally important for those babies who cannot be breastfed, into a normal food for any infant."  Commenting on the findings, Sarah Redshaw, from the BabyCentre website, said: "It is crucial to bear in mind the various barriers and challenges faced by mums when it comes to breastfeeding.  "Generally mums are aware that breastfeeding is best for their baby but often don't get the right support if they encounter problems in the early weeks - which many, many do.  "As a result, significant numbers give up on breastfeeding."	health

She was responding to an audience member on Question Time, who said the situation in Germany suggested "mass immigration maybe doesn't work."  Ms Phillips agreed it raised issues over violence towards women but said places such as Birmingham had their own issues with women being "heckled and baited" on nights out.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35412676	Proposed change to law on possession of wild bird eggs	The UK and Welsh governments are backing a change to the law on the possession of wild bird eggs.  They say anyone able to prove their eggs were taken from the wild before 1981 should not be prosecuted.  The law was changed in 2004 to require a licence and proof eggs were taken before 1954 but this was ruled unlawful because of a lack of consultation.  Ministers say reinstating the so-called "pre-1981 defence" against liability would be a proportionate step.  Officials said "clarifying" the law in England and Wales would have the effect of focusing resources on prosecuting those currently collecting and trading eggs rather than punishing people who have built up or inherited historical collections.  The move, it is hoped, will encourage those with collections of scientific value to hand them over to museums for research.  While the practice of collecting wild bird eggs is in decline, the two governments' joint consultation found that illegal activity was still going on and there was a need for legislation outlawing it - which first came into force in 1981 - to remain on the statute book.  The majority of those who responded to a consultation carried out by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs called for the so-called pre-1981 defence - which takes its name from the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act - to be reinstated.  When the Act was passed, it was specified that no-one would be prosecuted who could establish that their eggs were taken from the wild before the legislation came into force.  However, this was superseded in 2004 when the law was changed to make eggs taken after the passage of the 1954 Protection of Birds Act the "burden of proof" for criminal liability.  Critics of the move argue this has had the effect of retrospectively criminalising anyone who collected bird eggs legally between 1954 and 1981.  The regulations were approved by Parliament in 2004 via a statutory instrument, without a full debate, and were designed to bring the UK into line with an EU directive on the definition of wild birds.  But they were later deemed unlawful because the public had not been properly consulted on the issue of removing the pre-1981 exemption.  In a high-profile case, John Dodsworth's 2009 conviction for the illegal possession of nearly 1,000 wild bird eggs was quashed by the High Court in 2012 on the grounds that the 1981 pre-defence had been "effectively removed without consultation".  Lawyers for Mr Dodsworth, who had previous convictions for wildlife offences, argued he could not have known he was breaking the law by being in possession of a collection of eggs assembled by others over decades and given to him before 2004.  They also warned the law as it stood had major implications for museums and other holders of potentially valuable collections.  Defra has now concluded there would be no significant benefit to wildlife conservation in maintaining the existing regulations.  By reverting to the 1981 pre-defence, the department says it would ensure the UK complied with EU laws while making it more likely valuable collections were preserved and not disposed of in a hasty fashion.  "Reinstating the pre-1981 defence is a proportionate response to, what is now, a declining activity," it said.  In reaching its decision, the UK and Welsh governments noted that there was no forensic method to authenticate the age of eggs to determine the legality of individual collections.  The RSPCA said egg collecting had been "on the wane" since tougher penalties, including the risk of jail sentences, were introduced in 2001 but still posed a serious threat.  The charity, one of 16 organisations - including police forces and museums - and 18 individuals to respond to the consultation, said the 1981 law had been full of "loopholes" and it would have preferred the 2004 regulations to stay in place as part of the "legislative armoury" against offenders.  "We are going to go back to where we were," said Guy Shorrock, the organisation's senior investigations officer. "I suspect that there will be some egg collectors who will be pretty happy with this because they think it will make their life a bit easier."  But Mr Shorrock said it was not a "huge issue" and was unlikely to have a big impact on the amount of prosecutions brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS says it weighs up all the evidence, not just dates of possession, before deciding whether to launch proceedings.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35435684	Dilma Roussef calls on Brazil society to unite against Zika virus	President Dilma Rousseff has called on the whole of Brazilian society to help combat the spread of the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects.  Ms Rousseff said national mobilisation was needed to eliminate the mosquitoes that spread the disease, and urged community groups and unions to help.  Zika, a form of microcephaly, is thought to cause infant brain damage.  Three to four million people could be infected with Zika in the Americas this year, experts have warned.  Ms Rousseff rejected comments made by her health minister earlier this week, who said Brazil was badly losing the fight against the virus.  But Brazil is the country worst affected by the Zika outbreak, with 270 cases of microcephaly confirmed by the health ministry and 3,448 being investigated.  Concerns have arisen about Brazil's ability to safely host this year's Olympic Games in the capital Rio de Janeiro. Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee, has said steps are being taken to protect the event.  The IOC said it will issue guidelines later on Friday for athletes and visitors taking part.  A group of Brazilian lawyers, activists and scientists is to ask the country's supreme court to allow abortions for women who have contracted the virus.  Abortions are illegal in Brazil, except in health emergencies or cases of rape or, since 2012, another brain condition known as anencephaly.  The new petition is to be delivered to the supreme court in two months' time. The BBC has learned that it argues that "the Brazilian state is responsible for the Zika outbreak" for not having eradicated the Aedes aegypti mosquito which carries it.  Brazilian women "should not be penalised for the consequences of flawed policies", it says.  The group behind the microcephaly supreme court plea also won the exception for anencephaly in 2012.  Debora Diniz, a law professor at Brasilia University, told the BBC the disease disproportionately affected the poor.  She said: "It is important to remember, when we talk about abortion and reproductive rights in general, that we have a social class split in Brazil - wealthy women will access safe abortion, legal or illegal, and poor women will go to the illegal market or continue to be pregnant."  Most people do not develop symptoms of the Zika virus but may pass the virus on to their children. There is no known cure or vaccine. The US says it hopes to begin human vaccine trials by the end of 2016.  Officials from the US National Institute of Health (NIH) said they had two potential Zika vaccines in development. One that is based on an experimental West Nile vaccine could be repurposed for Zika and enter clinical trials by the end of 2016, the NIH said.  WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said Zika had gone "from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions". She has set up a Zika "emergency team" following the "explosive" spread of the virus.  The team will meet on Monday to decide whether Zika should be treated as a global emergency.  Zika was first detected in Uganda in 1947, but has never caused an outbreak on this scale. Brazil reported the first cases of Zika in South America in May 2015.  WHO officials said between 500,000 and 1.5 million people had been infected in Brazil, and the virus has since spread to more than 20 countries in the region.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35411702	Short home care visits 'plague system'	Unacceptably short 15-minute home care visits to elderly and disabled people are still plaguing the care system in England, a report suggests.  Research by Unison found "distressing" cases of care being compromised after surveying councils and care workers.  Councils are not meant to schedule 15-minute visits for personal care, like help with washing, dressing or eating.  But the union said its findings showed many were still doing just that despite repeated calls for longer visits.  Ministers have been demanding councils which are in charge of care services stop using the so-called "flying visits".  And guidance issued last year by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said visits should last at least 30 minutes unless it was for a quick check-up as part of a wider package of care, such as calling in to make sure someone has taken medication.  Unison received responses to a Freedom of Information request from all 152 councils with responsibility for social care, just as the guidance was being introduced and received feedback from 1,100 care staff via an online survey.  Three-quarters of councils reported they used 15-minute visits although a third said they were for quick checks for justifiable reasons.  But Unison said it still suggested there were major problems, with three-quarters of care staff filling in the online survey complaining they did not have enough time to provide dignified care.  Half reported they had been asked to provide personal care for people they had never even met before with carers reporting they were left feeling "angry, ashamed and embarrassed" by the standard of care they could provide.  One carer said: "I had to visit a lady who is 102 years old for a shower, help her get dressed, make food, tidy her kitchen, give her medication and put her bins out in 20 minutes. It's humiliating as we haven't got time to have a chat."  Find out more about care at the BBC's cost of care website.  Use the BBC's care calculator to find out how much care costs where you live.  The government has argued it is investing in care services. It has created the Better Care Fund, worth £5.3bn this year, to ensure the NHS works more closely with councils on care.  Local authorities are also being given the power to increase council tax by 2% to invest in care.  But the Local Government Association has argued this does not make up for the wider cuts being made to councils, the costs of introducing the national living wage and the rising demand for support.  Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the LGA, said: "Short visits are sadly just one of the many symptoms of a social care and support system that is under enormous financial pressure."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35427912	Hand transplants to be carried out on NHS in England	Hand transplants are to be carried out on the NHS in England, health officials have said.  Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust will begin assessing suitable adult candidates and performing the "highly complex procedure" from April.  Hand transplants offer patients the only method of reconstruction that looks and functions like a normal hand.  If transplanted successfully, a new hand will be able to sense its surroundings and heal itself when hurt.  The patient will also be able to move it with dexterity and it will feel warm to the touch.  The centre in Leeds is headed up by consultant plastic surgeon Prof Simon Kay, who successfully performed the UK's first hand transplant in 2012.  "We are delighted to be confirmed as the provider of this new service," he said.  "The team here at Leeds is keen to now assess new patient referrals and benefit patients and their families in a way they may never have thought possible before."  Former pub landlord Mark Cahill from West Yorkshire was the first person in the UK to have the operation.  Mr Cahill had been unable to use his right hand after it was affected by gout. His operation was carried out on the NHS but under different commissioning rules, which were subsequently changed months after his operation.  Since the transplant, he has started regaining almost complete use of his hand - allowing him to carry out tasks such as tying his shoelaces, carrying his granddaughter and driving a car.  He said: "My experience as a patient and my quality of life since the hand transplant has been fantastic. It really has transformed my life."  He also said he wanted to publicly thank his donor.  Dr Jonathan Fielden, NHS England's director of specialised commissioning, described hand transplants as "cutting edge procedure", which had been shown to "significantly improve the quality of life for patients who meet the strict criteria".  He said: "We will be working closely with Prof Kay and his colleagues at Leeds, as well as NHS Blood and Transplant, to ensure that this highly innovative service for the NHS can get up and running as soon as possible."  About 80 hand transplants have been performed worldwide.  Experts say success rates are high provided patients are selected carefully and fully-prepared psychologically.  After the operation, patients need to take lifelong medication to stop limbs being rejected by the body and follow daily physiotherapy routines.  Meanwhile, Corrine Hutton is to become the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant.  She has been waiting for a suitable match for the past year-and-a-half.  Ms Hutton had her hands and feet amputated last summer after a pneumonia infection led to blood poisoning.	health

Newsnight had revealed key witnesses were reluctant to give evidence while Rob Semple was part of the process.  The inquiry was set up after the suicide of activist Elliott Johnson.  Mr Johnson's parents had called for Mr Semple to step down over his links with Mark Clarke, the man at the centre of many of the bullying allegations.  Last year Mr Semple became chairman of the Tory's volunteer organisation, the National Convention, with the strong support of Mr Clarke.  On Tuesday, the parents of Mr Johnson, the 21-year-old Tory activist whose suicide last September sparked claims of unchecked bullying within the party, told the BBC that Mr Semple should remove himself from any involvement in the inquiry, which is being undertaken by the law firm Clifford Chance.  Earlier this week, Mr Semple had insisted he would not step down and was no longer in touch with Mr Clarke, but, in a statement on Thursday, he announced a U-turn.  He said: "As a father myself, the wishes of Mr and Mrs Johnson are paramount to me and, after seeing their interview on BBC TV, I have decided to recuse myself from the board meeting that will discuss the Clifford Chance report.  "As a Conservative volunteer for 20 years, I want to establish the truth of what happened to Elliott.  "I am convinced the investigation will be fair and thorough and my decision must not be regarded as my accepting any suggestion that I would be less than impartial.  "As chairman of the voluntary party, I will be pressing for the implementation of all the recommendations of the investigation."  Mr Johnson, whose son Elliott had complained of being bullied before he died, said: "This is a victory for common sense.  "Mr Semple has done the right thing, but I still have deep reservations about this whole process.  "The Conservative Party seems to want to control this process which makes people very suspicious about its motives.  "I still don't believe this is a truly independent inquiry."  Fifteen key witnesses to the bullying inquiry had told the BBC they wanted Mr Semple to stand down from any involvement in overseeing the report on the scandal.  A number of them also said they would be reluctant to talk to the Clifford Chance investigation while he was still involved.  The law firm has been commissioned to file a report that will be considered by the Conservative Party board before it is published.  Mark Clarke has always denied any wrongdoing.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35427493	Zika virus: Up to four million Zika cases predicted	Three to four million people could be infected with Zika virus in the Americas this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts.  Most will not develop symptoms, but the virus, spread by mosquitoes, has been linked to brain defects in babies.  Meanwhile, the US says it hopes to begin human vaccine trials by the end of 2016.  The head of the International Olympic Committee says steps are being taken to protect the Games in Rio de Janeiro.  Thomas Bach said the IOC would issue advice this week on how to keep athletes and visitors safe in Brazil, the worst affected country.  WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said Zika had gone "from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions".  She has set up a Zika "emergency team" after the "explosive" spread of the virus.  It will meet on Monday to decide whether Zika should be treated as a global emergency.  The last time an international emergency was declared was for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people.  Zika: What you need to know  Zika was first detected in Uganda in 1947, but has never caused an outbreak on this scale.  Brazil reported the first cases of Zika in South America in May 2015.  Most cases result in no symptoms and it is hard to test for, but WHO officials said between 500,000 and 1.5 million people had been infected in the country.  The virus has since spread to more than 20 countries in the region.  At the same time there has been a steep rise in levels of microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads - and the rare nervous system disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.  The link between the virus and these disorders has not been confirmed, but Dr Chan said it was "strongly suspected" and was "deeply alarming".  And she warned the situation could yet deteriorate as "this year's El Nino weather patterns are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas".  The BBC's David Shukman, reporting from Recife in north-east Brazil, said doctors were "overwhelmed" by cases of microcephaly.  One hospital in the city had gone from dealing with an average of five cases a year to 300 in the past six months.  Earlier, doctors writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association said Zika had "explosive pandemic potential" and said the WHO's failure to act swiftly on Ebola probably cost thousands of lives.  In a statement to the executive board meeting of the WHO, Dr Chan said: "The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.  "Questions abound - we need to get some answers quickly.  "For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee.  "I am asking the Committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere."  Officials from the US National Institute of Health said they had two potential Zika vaccines in development.  One that is based on an experimental West Nile vaccine could be repurposed for Zika and enter clinical trials by the end of 2016, Dr Anthony Fauci from NIH said.  He said talks were already taking place with pharmaceutical companies, but a vaccine would not be widely available for several years.  Meanwhile Dr Anne Schuchat, from the Centers for Disease Control confirmed there had been 31 cases of Zika in the country - all linked to travel to the affected areas.  At a news conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the country's response to the virus so far had been "consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there".  "At this point, here in the United States, the risk of a disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low, the January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to the mosquito populations."  "But, obviously that's going to change," he added.  Dr Carissa Etienne, the regional-director for the WHO Pan American Health Organization, said the link between the abnormalities and Zika had not been confirmed.  But she added: "We cannot tolerate the prospect of more babies being born with neurological and other malformations and more people facing the threat of paralysis."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35435193	John Bercow says MPs would back temporary move during Parliament repairs	Commons Speaker John Bercow has said he thinks MPs would agree to temporarily move out of Parliament while £4bn repairs are carried out.  But he said they should only agree to move if a temporary, "pop-up" Commons chamber is constructed nearby and within Parliament's security cordon.  The cordon covers a number of government buildings in Whitehall.  Otherwise, Mr Bercow said in a Q&A session, politicians could be locked out of Parliament for many years.  A parliamentary committee is finalising controversial proposals to rehouse both the Commons and the Lords for up to six years while the ageing building is thoroughly renovated.  A decision is due within months and the move could take place after the 2020 general election.  The alternative: a much slower process of repairs could take place while MPs and peers continue working in the Palace of Westminster - but this could take more than 30 years to complete and cost nearly £6bn, 50% more.  In a question and answer session with the audience after a wide-ranging informal interview at St James Theatre in central London, Mr Bercow said it was important that MPs should be persuaded to abandon the decaying Victorian Palace of Westminster while the overhaul takes place.  He thought they would agree, on one condition: "We should preserve a 'pop-up chamber' on the Parliamentary estate, so that there is an incentive for those doing the work of restoration and refurbishment to do it to time."  Possible secure sites being discussed for such a temporary debating chamber for MPs include the Richmond House headquarters of the Department of Health in Whitehall, and the medieval monolithic splendour of Westminster Hall, the oldest part of Westminster, where monarchs lie in state and the trials were held of Charles I, and Thomas More.  It is thought other options such as adapting parts of the Treasury or the Foreign Office have been ruled out. Peers would also have to abandon Westminster and a temporary House of Lords could be housed in the QE II conference centre opposite Westminster Abbey.  The Commons Speaker, Mr Bercow, explained why he thought it was necessary to build a temporary debating chamber for MPs.  "If we were simply to go, in every respect, away from the House and to preserve nothing on the Parliamentary estate, it seems to me - on the principle of the doctrine of the occupied field - the contractors are occupying the field and we could be out for a long time. "  He also described how he could still represent his constituents despite his role as a neutral Speaker by summoning a Cabinet minister to see him in Speaker's House.  They apparently have to come to him, not the other way round. And woe betide the minister who displeases the Speaker: he or she faces a summons for what Mr Bercow's private secretary describes frostily as "a meeting without coffee".	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35433856	HIV becoming resistant to key drug, study finds	Strains of the HIV virus are becoming resistant to an antiretroviral drug commonly used to prevent and fight it, research has suggested.  HIV was resistant to the drug Tenofovir in 60% of cases in several African countries according to the study, covering the period from 1998 to 2015.  The research, led by University College London, looked at around 2,000 HIV patients worldwide.  Lead author Dr Ravi Gupta said the results were "extremely concerning".  The work, which took four years to complete, was started in 2012 and compared patients with HIV in Africa with those in Europe.  Splitting the sample size roughly into two groups the study found that in Africa 60% of patients were resistant to Tenofovir, whereas in Europe the figure was only 20%.  The paper, which has been published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, said poor administration of the drug, in terms of regularly taking the right levels of Tenofovir could be explanation for the discrepancy.  "If the right levels of the drug are not taken, as in they are too low or not regularly maintained, the virus can overcome the drug and become resistant," Dr Gupta told the BBC News website.  "Tenofovir is a critical part of our armamentarium against HIV, so it is extremely concerning to see such a high level of resistance to this drug," he added.  The paper also suggested that Tenofovir-resistant strains of HIV could be passed on from person to person.  "We certainly cannot dismiss the possibility that resistant strains can spread between people and should not be complacent. We are now conducting further studies to get a more detailed picture of how Tenofovir-resistant viruses develop and spread," Dr Gupta said.  HIV is the world's most deadly infectious disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Dr Gupta said a global effort and an cash investment would be needed to provide better facilities and monitoring in poorer African countries and that it was in everyone's interests to make this happen.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35427114	Migrant children 'deteriorating' in Calais camp	Thousands of migrants are currently living in camps known as "the Jungle" on the edge of Calais in northern France.  The population of the camp has risen steadily in recent weeks to about 2,500, including about 250 children, according to medical volunteer group, Medecins Sans Frontieres‎ (MSF).  Youth worker Liz Clegg has been working with women and children in "the Jungle" for several months.  She first visited the region to deliver camping equipment donated by festival goers at last year's Glastonbury Festival, but ended up staying to work with unaccompanied children aged between 10 and 13.  She told BBC News why she thinks it is important that the UK offer these children sanctuary.  "I work in a centre which was built for refugees by a group of volunteers from Ireland. The 10 to 13-year-olds that I work with are wonderful but they do have serious behavioural problems.  This is where the journey ends for many - and hope ends.  Children arrive with horrendous stories, but they are still full of life when they arrive. They stay here for three months and deteriorate, as they slowly come to realise that they may never get to Britain.  They are brainwashed that getting to the UK is the only thing that matters and that on their journey to the UK they must have nothing to do with authority and not get their pictures taken.  But these are children as young as 10. They are not capable of making this decision and they have no adults to help them.  We try to dissuade them from going onto the lorries, but it rarely works. These children are out every night trying to get to Britain. They come back cold, and tired and with no one to care for them.  Earlier this week one of the children was so upset that he was howling like a dog and fainting. He has no one here.  Another child, who was really chatty when he first arrived, is now unresponsive to anyone.  Some of the children pretend they are accompanied. They say they travelled here with an uncle, but after talking to them you soon realise that the uncle is normally an adult who they met on the journey rather than a blood relation.  When they get to Calais this adult often abandons them to get on a lorry to the UK.  The youngest child I have worked with is 10-years-old. He was separated from a family member on the journey from Afghanistan.  Most of the children in this age-group seem to come from Afghanistan but I've worked with Syrians, Kurds and children from Eritrea over the past few months.  I strongly believe that if we are going to take child protection seriously then we need to look at the children in Calais, and not just the camps around Syria. Especially the young ones.  They are little and miss their families and they have no one."	politics

The virus, which has no symptoms 80% of the time, is blamed for causing stunted brain development in babies.  About 3,500 cases of microcephaly have been identified in Brazil so far.  And medical staff in Recife, a state capital in north-east Brazil, say they are struggling to cope with at least 240 cases of microcephaly in children.  The city's Health Secretary, Jailson Correia, a specialist in tropical diseases, told the BBC he and others needed "to fight very hard".  "This is a major public health challenge, probably the most serious we have had to face in recent Brazilian history - and already it's become a globalised issue," he said.  He was speaking in a situation room, where a large map of Recife shows where mosquitoes are most prevalent - and many areas are peppered with small pins to mark microcephaly cases.  The connection between Zika and microcephaly has not yet been definitely established - but there is growing evidence, with traces of the virus having been found in affected babies, their mothers and their umbilical cords.  Mr Correia said a spike in infections by another mosquito-borne disease, dengue fever, in the first part of last year may in fact have included cases of Zika, which would explain the spike in microcephaly cases later in the year, with a peak last November.  "We may be talking about Recife having 50,000 to 100,000 people exposed to Zika in the first semester of 2015," he said, "and we are now seeing a secondary wave of cases with microcephaly."  At the Oswaldo Cruz hospital, one of Recife's largest, mothers waited patiently in the tropical heat for their babies to be examined.  Many had travelled for hours.  One young woman, Erone Maria Le Lima, had brought her two-month-old daughter, Caroline Vitoria, whose head was seen as being smaller than normal just before she was born.  "I was caught by surprise," she told me, "but we are going to do everything to make sure it's going to be OK, to make her life better."  The doctor in charge of the department, Maria Angela Rocha, said staff had been overwhelmed by a rise from an average of five cases of microcephaly a year over the past six years to about 300 in the past six months.  "The mothers are stressed, and the professionals too have a lot of stress," she said.  "There is a lot of insecurity for the families."  Recife is an urban sprawl in a low-lying coastal area with a warm, humid and showery climate creating puddles and other bodies of water that can harbour mosquito larvae.  At City Hall, Mr Correia highlighted an aggressive campaign that had cut the numbers of households harbouring mosquitoes.  But these are conditions replicated in many other tropical cities, and the advice from Recife's health department is to raise awareness about the risks as early as possible.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35421459	Needle-phobic pancreas transplant 'world first'	A British woman has become the first person in the world to have a pancreas transplant because of a severe needle phobia, her doctors have said.  Sue York - who has had type-1 diabetes since she was seven - would shake uncontrollably and vomit when injecting herself with insulin.  Ms York told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the operation had "completely altered my life".  Doctors said her life expectancy had now doubled.  Ms York, 55, from Lincoln, told the programme that, following the operation, at Manchester Royal Infirmary, she felt "incredible" and full of energy.  "No longer am I struggling to walk up a flight of stairs, getting breathless walking into the wind. No longer is my skin yellow or grey. No longer do I look constantly exhausted," she said.  "I've had to get new glasses because my eyesight has improved and feeling has returned to areas on my feet where I'd begun to lose sensation."  Ms York said her phobia had reached a critical point in 2012, when the DVLA had changed its regulations in relation to diabetic drivers, insisting they checked blood glucose levels - requiring her to prick her skin - before driving and once every two hours behind the wheel.  "It was just too many needles, too many invasions into the flesh," she said.  Ms York had decided to give up driving, she said, but her body had been too weak to walk long distances - leaving her at risk of becoming housebound.  She had tried hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy in an attempt to cure her phobia, but without success.  And injecting herself with insulin would frequently take 20 minutes.  It took more than two years for Ms York to be placed on a waiting list for the transplant, during which time she said she appeared in front of a panel three times to discuss her eligibility.  She said questions had been raised over her need for the transplant, given that she did not have any kidney complications, and over whether her phobia was a strong enough reason to undergo major surgery.  Surgeon Dr Raman Dhanda said guidelines were currently in place nationally and internationally to ensure those with the greatest need received transplants.  In Ms York's instance, he added: "It was a very hard decision to make, because [her] case was clearly very exceptional."  Ms York, who said a phobia of needles was common among long-term diabetics, believes her story could give hope to others.  "I don't know who my donor is, but I thank them and their family from the bottom of my heart," she said.  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35411701	Older people in need 'let down by NHS'	Older people in need of urgent help are being failed by the NHS in England, according to a group of health leaders.  Too many over-65s end up in accident and emergency unnecessarily, says the NHS Confederation's Commission on Improving Urgent Care for Older People.  The group said this was because of a lack of help when they fell ill.  It called for radical steps, including providing emergency care at home and getting doctors to carry out "ward rounds" in care homes.  The commission's report said older people were "poorly served" and "all too often forced to go to A&E".  And once in hospital, they faced longer stays and losing some of their independence.  The report said older people needed more help navigating the complexities of the health and care system.  It pointed to an Age UK scheme in Cornwall, where the frailest people had co-ordinators helping organise their care.  It also said GPs could identify and work with patients most at risk of hospital admission.  The report also highlighted a scheme in north-east London, where hospital and ambulance staff were working together to provide emergency care in people's homes.  Nurses and paramedics assess and treat older people who have fallen but not suffered a fracture.  Equipment, such as walking frames, can be arranged.  And from April to July last year, seven in 10 of the patients seen had stayed at home.  Another project highlighted was in Hertfordshire, where GPs visited care home residents on a regular basis, with rapid response teams on call to attend to residents who needed urgent help.  Dr Mark Newbold, who chairs the commission, said: "Older people do need to access A&E at times, and the best hospitals tailor their service to meet their needs.  "But all too often, older people are forced to go to A&E because the alternative services that would help them be cared for at home are not available at the time they need them."  A Department of Health spokeswoman said the government was fully supportive of the ideas put forward.  She pointed out a pot of money known as the Better Care Fund - amounting to £5.3bn this year - had been set aside to fund schemes largely focused on keeping people out of hospital.  The vision of improving care for older people was "being realised", she added.  Meanwhile, the Local Government Association has called for more to be done to tackle loneliness, now a "major public health concern".  Councillor Izzi Seccombe said it was increasingly being reported as an issue among older people referred to councils for care.  She said the solution lay in supporting befriending schemes and those that tackled social isolation, many of which were run by the voluntary sector.  "The impact of loneliness can be devastating," she added.	health

Ministers want to cut Employment Support Allowance by £30 a week to spur some new claimants to return to work.  But Labour, Lib Dem and independent peers joined forces to block the move, arguing it would make it harder for those affected to pay for the support that might allow them to find work.  The government may try to overturn it at a later date in the Commons.  Ministers lost the vote on an amendment to the Welfare Reform and Work Bill by 283 votes to 198, a majority of 85.  The vote was welcomed by disability campaigners, who say there is "deep unease" about the cuts to ESA and other benefits.  Opposition peers argued that cuts to Employment Support Allowance (ESA) for new claimants in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) - people deemed unfit to work but able to undertake activities to help them move towards work - would cause hardship for substantial numbers of people with disabilities.  Speaking in the debate, crossbencher Lord Low said: "A drop of £1,500 a year in their benefit income from £5,300 to £3,800 will be catastrophic for many disabled people.  "It will exacerbate poverty among the disabled - a third of working age disabled adults live in poverty already compared with only a fifth of those who are not disabled. The government's proposals would push many further towards, or actually into, poverty.  "The proposals would cause unnecessary hardship and anxiety to people who have been independently assessed as unfit for work, and the measures are likely to have a disproportionately adverse impact on disabled people."  Mencap's Ron Holland, who is chair of the Disability Benefits Commission, said: "The government wants to get more disabled people into work, but as a sector we have warned that cutting ESA WRAG, and its equivalent payment in Universal Credit, will directly undermine that commitment whilst pushing disabled people further from work and closer to or into poverty.  "This proposed cut together with the crisis in social care funding means disabled people are facing losses to critical support they need to make ends meet and to be included in society."  Welfare minister Lord Freud said ESA needed reform since, at the moment, only 1% of those in the WRAG category moved off the benefit each month. While the move would save some £55m in its first year, he said £60m would be spent during the same period to help disabled people into work.  "As a government, we want to ensure that we spend money responsibly in a way that improves individuals life chances and helps them achieve their ambitions, rather than paying for a lifetime wasted on benefits," he said.  And former Health Secretary Lord Lansley defended the changes, insisting they would encourage people with a capability to work to find employment.  "The bigger the gap between income in work and income through benefits, the greater the likelihood for people seeking work and finding it," he said.  Earlier on Wednesday, ministers agreed to exempt some adoptive and family groups from plans to limit Universal Credit benefits to only two children.	politics

Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr Bildt said "friends must stay together" and the EU could start to "fracture" if the UK leaves.  The UK would not be able to access the single market, unless it also retains freedom of movement in the EU, he said.  The UK referendum on membership of the EU is due by the end of 2017.  A UK vote to leave the European Union would result in a "very, very messy separation", he said.  Asked if the UK would be able to stay in the single market, but be able to restrict movement of people, he said did not see that as a viable possibility.  He said the EU would "lose credibility" if the UK leaves and urged the country not to get "bogged down in its own contradictions".  "We are living in a more dangerous world," he said.  "That means friends must stay together. If you suddenly see a Europe that starts to fracture with a significant country leaving, that is going to be a weaker Europe - and in my opinion a more dangerous Europe for everyone."  Mr Bildt was prime minister of Sweden from 1991-1994 and then foreign minister from 2006-2014.  He said his own country was "too far ahead" of the rest of Europe in terms of the numbers of refugees it has taken as a result of the migrant crisis.  "We need to calm down the numbers in Sweden somewhat... Over time we need to move to a truly common asylum system."  Europe had been "surprised by the magnitude of the meltdown in the Middle East", he said.  "We did not have sufficient control of our external borders in the Schengen system - that must be restored. That was a security issue."  But he said he found discussion in the UK around border control "somewhat bizarre".  "When you go past Calais and go into the tunnel, there is barbed wire," he said.  "The French are protecting the external border of the United Kingdom now... It looks like you have control of the external border today."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35424606	House points	The fly-fishers are back; when the chairs of select committees were up for election last summer, MPs learned to dread running the gauntlet of glad-handing candidates who would lurk at various strategic bottlenecks angling for votes.  The departure of Huw Irranca-Davies, who's quitting Westminster to seek a seat in the Welsh Assembly, has created an opening for a chair of the Environmental Audit Committee - which he has only held for a couple of months. That committee chair has been allocated to the Labour Party - but all MPs across all parties have a vote in the election, which will be held next week.  Nominations close on Monday, and so far three runners have emerged: former leadership candidate Mary Creagh, Co-Op party stalwart Geraint Davies and Barry Gardiner. That last name is an interesting one, because Mr Gardiner - an acknowledged energy policy expert - is part of Labour's shadow energy team.  He says his leadership are completely relaxed about his attempt to swap the front bench for the committee corridor. An effective chair is crucial to the impact a select committee has, and Environmental Audit, with its cross-government remit, could become a real powerhouse, under the right leadership.  Looking at the membership of the special select committee peers voted to set up, to consider the impact of the Trade Union Bill on party funding (there were warnings that its provisions could cut funding for the Labour Party by £6m), I suspect there might be.  The crossbench peer and former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns is the chairman, and batting for the government are four Conservatives: Lord Callanan, Lord de Mauley, Lord Robathan and Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury. Labour field ex-union officials Baroness Dean (former Leader of SOGAT), Lord (Larry) Whitty (ex GMB) and Baroness Drake (a former President of the TUC) plus the former Leader of the House, Lord Richard. The Lib Dem contingent consists of Lord Tyler, who first proposed this committee, and Lord Wrigglesworth.  And the team is completed by the newly arrived Crossbencher, the Earl of Kinnoull.  Looking at that cast of characters, the committee will probably end up providing a line of argument helpful to the Labour-Lib Dem cause when it reports at the end of February, tee-ing up hostile amendments which could well be voted through at report stage - unless both Crossbench peers repeatedly side with the Conservatives.  Last week saw a relative rarity; a meeting of the Commons Privileges Committee, which deals with matters touching the rights of the House. It was a private meeting so I don't know what they talked about - but just about the only privileges issue in their in-tray is the complaint from the last parliament that three witnesses, Tom Crone, Colin Myler and Les Hinton, and that the company they had worked for, News International, misled the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee….  This dates all the way back to 2012 when, on a majority vote, the committee included that claim in their report on the phone hacking scandal.  While there were a number of live criminal trials of other individuals accused of hacking offences, the Privileges Committee postponed any action - but the coast is now clear. Could we see a final act in the hacking scandal? Will witnesses like Les Hinton (he issued a rebuttal of the committee's claims, which he called "unfair, unfounded and erroneous") be re-examined, or will the complaint be dropped as quietly as possible. Watch this space.  When an MP is arrested, for whatever reason, the fact is recorded in the Commons business papers; this is an immemorial convention dating back to the days when such an arrest may well have been an attempt by the Crown to interfere in the workings of Parliament. But these days it can highlight an allegation against an MP at an early stage, far earlier than would be the case for non-MPs.  Next month the Commons will vote on a proposal to change that, so in future arrests will only be reported where the Clerks consider that what has happened is, in some way an infringement of the rights of Parliament; so an arrest for, say, a bar-room brawl, would not be publicised in the Commons business papers; but the Damian Green case, where an MP's Commons office was searched, would.  Of course this would not stop Her Majesty's Press finding out in other ways....it just wouldn't be via an official Commons publication.  Blink and you'd have missed the one overt sign of it, but behind the scenes, there's a considerable spat under way about the game-playing over private members' bill debates on a Commons Friday. Last week, private members' bill terminator Chris Chope was so annoyed at the government's tactics that he shouted "object" - and blocked an attempt to give an unopposed second reading to an uncontroversial measure to tidy up an MPs' hardship fund, set up after World War II, much to the visible annoyance of the bill's promoter, Sir Paul Beresford.  A minimal morsel of revenge, perhaps, but it presages a bigger problem. You see, the supply of private members' bills is drying up.  So many of the current crop of bills were killed off at second reading, that there are only a handful left to return to the Commons for report stage and third reading - and there are still plenty of sitting Fridays scheduled: on 29 January, 5 and 26 February, and 4 and 11 March. If there are no bills left to come back to the Commons, where they would take priority for debate, then all sorts of presentation bills and ten minute rule bills might suddenly end up being debated.  Bills on subjects like human trafficking, ovarian cancer, bat habitats, BBC privatisation and much, much more might surface for debate.  And since most of them emanate from Mr Chope and his usual suspect colleague, Peter Bone, they will mostly be on subjects the government would prefer not to have debated and not to have to respond to. I particularly like the sound of Mr Bone's Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which currently tops the agenda on 4 March.	politics

Labour MP Yvette Cooper said it was not "appropriate" or "statesmanlike" for him to use such language about a "complex and sensitive" issue.  Shadow minister Kate Green said it was "offensive, hurtful... and divisive".  Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp "they could all come to Britain".  At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as "disgraceful".  Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant.  But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions.  "We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff," said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the "bedroom tax" and a High Court ruling that it is "discriminatory". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.  The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was "not part of Saudi-led operations" in Yemen.  But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's "bunch of migrants" comment.  Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.  The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.  Mr Cameron replied: "The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.  "Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.  "They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.  "They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.  "The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers."  Several Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's "bunch of migrants" comments on Twitter, describing them as "shameful" and "inflammatory" and the PM as "odious".  A Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase "demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep".  Yvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use "much more statesmanship-like" language on such a "complex and sensitive" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.  She got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order  She asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to "withdraw" the comment.  Mr Bercow told Ms Cooper: "You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.  "I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously."  He ruled that it was not "disorderly" or "un-Parliamentary" but added "people will make their own assessments of this matter".  The prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent £1.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would "open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais".  Asked if he considered the phrase "bunch of migrants" to be pejorative the spokesman said "the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right".  Mr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the "bunch of migrants" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.  But this was dismissed as "silly and playing cheap politics" by small business minister Anna Soubry  She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the "language of ordinary people", adding "we all use slang" in the heat of the moment.  David Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.  Mr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a "major success" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a "step forward", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it "derisory".  Mr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was "0%".  Mr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.  "Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st," he said.  "They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.  "Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?"'  Mr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.  Firstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a "victory" and a "major success". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.  Secondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.  Thirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.  HMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.  But few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.  Mr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a "striking" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.  Downing Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.  "It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come," Mr Cameron said.  "It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity."  The SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.  He called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).  Mr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at £155 a week would end discrimination because "so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension".  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.  "The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe," he said.  He urged Mr Cameron to "welcome in and provide a home" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.  In response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been "more generous" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35422772	Corbyn must connect with public to survive says Kinnock	Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has questioned whether Jeremy Corbyn can win power and said he could face calls to stand down if he does not "make advances" with the public.  Lord Kinnock said Mr Corbyn's task was to "win power for the party" rather than to "secure power in the party".  While Mr Corbyn should have "space" to lead, he said he must pass clear tests.  And he suggested that if Mr Corbyn failed to connect with the electorate, "he may come to his own conclusions".  In an article for the New Statesman, Lord Kinnock - who led the party between 1983 and 1992 and lost two general elections - appealed for the party to pull together, saying any split in Labour's ranks similar to that which led to the creation of the SDP in the 1980s would be very damaging.  He said Mr Corbyn must be judged on his performance but suggested it was hard for the Labour leader and his close allies to "uphold unity" given Mr Corbyn's record of rebelling against former leaders, including himself.  Assessing Labour's and Mr Corbyn's long-term prospects, he wrote: "It's difficult to see that [Jeremy Corbyn is electable].  "Many of the people who voted for Jeremy are outstanding party members who said that they were frustrated - indeed, infuriated - by the failure of Labour to connect with the electorate.  "I know exactly what they mean, but that's the test. If Jeremy is seen to be failing to connect to the electorate after a reasonable space of time then he may come to his own conclusions."  Lord Kinnock, who supported Andy Burnham for leader in last year's contest, added: "There's a fundamental question here and it is whether people want to secure power in the party or to win power for the party.  "Those people who want to win power, whether they're left, right or centre, will be watching the evidence and will make their decision on the basis of that evidence. Not because of some spasm of emotion, or the fact that their candidate didn't get elected:  "They'll want to know they have a party that is being led in its advance with the electorate. If that isn't the case then conclusions must be drawn."  Mr Corbyn, who had never served on the frontbench in his long political career before being elected in a landslide victory in September, has insisted that he is making progress as opposition leader and has forced the government onto the back foot on a range of issues.  He has acknowledged that elections in May for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and English councils, as well as the election of a new London Mayor, will be an important test of his leadership and standing with the public.  The Conservatives are seeking to turn the mayoral contest into a referendum on Mr Corbyn's leadership, describing Labour candidate Sadiq Khan as "Mr Corbyn's man in City Hall".  Labour's official report into its 2015 defeat published last week concluded it would be a "huge challenge" for Labour to win power in 2020, whoever was leader.	politics

Public Health England said the success of MMR vaccination meant the infection was now incredibly rare and the screening was causing unnecessary stress.  Infection during pregnancy can lead to brain damage and other health problems for the baby in the womb.  The rest of the UK is also considering the measure.  The viral infection - also known as German measles - is mild, causing a rash and fever.  But it becomes very serious in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, when it can lead to sight and hearing problems, brain damage and heart defects.  Pregnant women are offered a blood test to determine whether they are immune to the virus.  The UK's National Screening Committee recommended in 2012 that rubella screening should stop because levels of the virus were so low that the World Health Organization classed rubella as eliminated in the UK.  Screening will stop in England in April.  Public Health England (PHE) said high uptake of the MMR jab - which protects against measles, mumps and rubella - was allowing it to make the decision.  Dr Anne Mackie, the director of screening programmes at PHE, said: "The decision to end rubella susceptibility screening in pregnancy in England is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence and expert clinical advice.  "Screening for rubella in pregnancy does not give any protection to the unborn baby in that pregnancy.  "The best preventative measure a woman can take to protect herself from rubella is to ensure she is immunised with the MMR vaccine before she gets pregnant."  The charity Sense, set up by parents affected by rubella, welcomed the news.  Joff McGill, from the charity, said: "It is a cause for celebration that in the UK there is no endemic rubella and congenital rubella syndrome births are now rare thanks to the childhood immunisation programme and high levels of MMR uptake.  "Stopping rubella screening in pregnancy will not lead to an increase in cases of congenital rubella syndrome.  "The only way that will happen is if there are significant rubella outbreaks, and we can ensure that doesn't happen by continued high levels of uptake of MMR."	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35418556	Many High Street pharmacies in England face closure, says minister	Thousands of High Street pharmacies in England face closure following plans to cut NHS funding by £170m, according to Health Minister Alistair Burt.  Department of Health officials argue that in some parts of the country there are more pharmacies than needed.  But the Royal Pharmaceutical Society says this could put more pressure on GPs and accident and emergency departments.  Discussions on the proposals will continue until March.  Official estimates suggest an average community pharmacy, as opposed to one within a hospital, receives about £220,000 in NHS funding each year.  But according to the Department of Health, funding for these pharmacies is set to fall from £2.8bn to £2.63bn from October as part of the drive to find £22bn of savings across the health service by 2020.  While officials say it is not yet clear how many pharmacies will close, Mr Burt, Minister for Community and Social Care, estimates it could be between 1,000 and 3,000, out of 11,674 overall.  Speaking at a meeting of MPs and peers at the All-Party Pharmacy Group earlier this month, he said the extent of the closures would depend on the ability of individual pharmacies to cope with NHS funding cuts.  But he warned smaller, independent pharmacies were most likely to be affected.  Sandra Gidley from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said: "We have a number of concerns.  "We have spent a lot of time and energy encouraging people to come to pharmacies for health advice to cut pressure on A&E departments and GP services.  "Under the plans pharmacies could be forced to cut staff and have less capacity to give important health advice.  "The government must consider the capacity that the community pharmacy network provides to relieve pressures on GPs and A&E."  Meanwhile the Department of Health estimates there was a rise of about 20% in the number of pharmacies it funded between 2003 and 2015.  And it says about 40% of community pharmacies are found in clusters - with three or more within 10 minutes' walk of each other.  Officials say other changes need to be considered too - such as click-and-collect services to allow patients to file prescriptions online.  A Department of Health spokesperson said: "We are investing record amounts in the NHS, but the whole health and care sector must make efficiencies to fulfil the NHS's own five-year plan.  "We want to improve the way patients access their medicines, through click-and-collect as well as being able to see pharmacists in care homes, GP surgeries and A&E.  "There is no estimate of the number of pharmacies operating in coming years and with NHS England we are consulting on a scheme to give better support to isolated or rural pharmacies."  NHS England is also involved in a pilot project, creating 400 clinical pharmacist roles to work within GP practices.	health

Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report "disingenuous".  He said it was an "another example of the Leave campaign fudging the facts".  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures.  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum.  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: "It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes."  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would "continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future", he said.  "Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries," he said.  "Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services."  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: "This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000."  The figures should not be taken as a "precise estimate" but were "intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined", it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are "self-sufficient" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs.  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: "Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  "The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left."  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.	politics

Speaking at a rally for Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith, the prime minister warned about the dangers of a Labour victory for the capital's economy.  Mr Goldsmith said his Labour rival was "Mr Corbyn's man" in City Hall.  But Mr Khan said he was "no patsy" to Mr Corbyn and would stand up to him.  It is 100 days until London elects a new mayor to succeed Boris Johnson, who is stepping down after eight years.  The vote will be a key electoral test for Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, for whom the capital was one of the few bright spots in last year's dismal general election defeat. Last May, Labour won four seats from the Tories in London and hope to win back City Hall for the first time since 2008.  Addressing a rally of Conservative activists, Mr Cameron sought to frame the election as an early verdict on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party as well as a choice between Mr Goldsmith and Mr Khan.  "Zac Goldsmith can be a great mayor. You've got the man and the plan, think for a moment about the alternative," he said.  "Sadiq Khan nominated Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of the Labour party and he doesn't regret it. Never mind the fact he (Mr Corbyn) wants to give the Falklands back to Argentina or he thinks that nuclear submarines should patrol the Atlantic without any missiles.  "His policy is to bring back and legalise secondary strikes and flying pickets. Just think what the first Corbyn-elected Mayor would be like for our economy, for our city. You do not want to be lab rats in the first Corbyn economic experiment in public life".  Ahead of the rally, the Conservatives launched a poster campaign depicting Mr Goldsmith as "your man in City Hall".  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Khan said he would stand up to the Labour leader over the issue of Trident renewal and Mr Corbyn's plans for a "Robin Hood" tax on financial transactions, which Mr Khan opposes.  "That is the job of the Mayor of London: not to be a patsy or a spokesperson for George Osborne and David Cameron - as Mr Goldsmith is being - or Jeremy Corbyn or the party, but to be London's advocate to their party and the government."  While he said he did not regret nominating Mr Corbyn for leader - and therefore allowing him to get onto the ballot paper - he said he would have his "own mandate" if he was elected.  "There will be occasions when frankly speaking I disagree with Jeremy," he said, citing his support for Gatwick expansion and pro-business agenda.  He said he wanted to build the broadest electoral alliance: "When you meet and study the best mayors from around the world they are not tribal. What they try and do is to reach across the entire city."  The Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the Green Party and the English Democrats are also fielding candidates in May's election while former Respect MP George Galloway is also standing. The Conservatives and Labour won 84% of the vote between them in the first round in 2012.	politics

In her first broadcast interview, Alison Johnson told BBC Newsnight that the party had acted insensitively and offered no support to them since the death of their son, Elliott, in September last year.  "They are probably thinking that... we will go away quietly. But we won't. I want justice for my son," she said.  The Conservative Party said: "We would like to again express our very deepest sympathies to Elliott's family and friends."  BBC Newsnight has also learned that 15 key witnesses have called for the removal of a senior Conservative official from any involvement with the party's inquiry into the scandal.  A number of them told Newsnight they would be reluctant to talk to the investigation while the official, who has previously been associated with the former activist at the heart of the scandal, is involved in the handling of the inquiry in any way.  Mrs Johnson's son committed suicide last year after allegedly being bullied by Mark Clarke - the man who ran a road-trip campaign bussing Conservative supporters to marginal constituencies before last year's General Election.  The death of the 21-year-old led to claims the Conservative Party Headquarters (CCHQ) had ignored complaints and warnings about the conduct of Clarke and others.  This prompted the resignation from the government of Grant Schapps, who had been co-chair of the party, and the launch of an inquiry by the London law firm, Clifford Chance.  Mrs Johnson told the BBC she and her husband Ray had been frozen out by the Conservative Party.  "The Conservative Party have not been forthright in coming to speak to us in any way. Anything we've heard we've had to hear through the press. When they engaged Clifford Chance to do the investigation we heard through the press."  She said that they had been particularly offended when it appeared the inquiry wanted to speak to her and her husband separately. She said it left them feeling like suspects whose accounts were being tested.  "We also heard that they wanted to interview me and my husband individually, to find out what our stories are... But it is not a story. It is the facts. We can only deal with the facts. Elliott has now gone, we can only deal with the facts."  A spokesman for Clifford Chance said: "We are sorry to learn of the Johnsons' concerns about the proposed interview format and would welcome the opportunity to discuss alternative arrangements for them to be interviewed."  Mrs Johnson also said it felt like the Conservative Party was keeping them in the dark.  "We live in a backwater so they are probably thinking that if we silence them we will go away quietly, but we won't. We definitely won't. I want justice for my son... no matter how it comes out, I want justice."  Mrs Johnson said Christmas had been awful without her son. An empty chair had been left at the table, she said.  "Every day just drifts into another and you just don't know anything."  Activist says Tory chairman given bullying dossier in 2010  Mrs Johnson spoke as a BBC Newsnight investigation revealed that 15 key witnesses who have potentially valuable testimony about bullying have called for a senior Tory official to step down from the inquiry process.  Though Clifford Chance has been commissioned to conduct the investigation, the firm's final report will be reviewed by group of senior Tories who will decide how the findings are presented.  One of those assessing the conclusions is Rob Semple, chair of the Tory volunteers' organisation, the National Convention. Mr Semple's candidacy for this post was supported by Mark Clarke.  Last year's election was marred by smearing of Mr Semple's rival for the post, Charles Heslop.  Mr Semple told Newsnight he condemned "any alleged negative remarks about another member of the Party that might have been made, without my knowledge, during the National Convention campaign".  However, many potential witnesses to the bullying inquiry believe Mr Semple's presence on the board in untenable - and believe he should step aside from any role in the inquiry.  Ten of the 15 key witnesses told Newsnight that Rob Semple's continued presence on the Board would deter them from giving evidence.  Ben Harris Quinney, chair of the Bow Group, has been invited to give evidence. He has yet to decide whether he will.  "If Rob Semple doesn't stand down it says that the Conservative Party is not interested in doing the right thing and ensuring this doesn't happen again. They are merely interested in trying to cling on and get away with it and hope that the story goes away as quickly as possible," he said.  John Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, told Newsnight that if Mr Semple refuses to recuse himself, CCHQ should order him to do stand down.  "There is no reason whatsoever in my view why anybody who was involved with Mark Clarke should be participating and it would be a bad thing for justice if that happened."  Mr Stafford said the bullying crisis currently engulfing CCHQ was the worst he had experienced in his 40 years as a member the party.  "This is the biggest of all. This is the absolute biggest of all. The party can no longer treat its members with contempt as it has in the past and which it is still doing."  In a statement to Newsnight, Mr Semple said he would not stand down - and denied he was still in touch with Mark Clarke.  "I am committed to ensuring that the highest possible standards of behaviour are upheld. I will ensure… Clifford Chance's findings will be honoured in full. I urge witnesses to come forward so that the full facts are known."  A Conservative Party spokesman said: "Rob Semple is not being asked to step down from the Board when the report is delivered."

The tragic case of one-year-old William Mead, from Cornwall, who died of sepsis in 2014, has raised fresh concerns that the condition is not being spotted or treated early enough.  Sepsis happens when the body's immune system - the way the body responds to bugs and germs - goes into overdrive.  The initial problem can be quite mild and start anywhere - from a cut on the finger to a chest or urine infection, for example.  But when the immune system overreacts this can lead to an unintended but catastrophic attack on the body.  If left untreated this sets off a cascade of reactions - from shock to organ failure and even death.  There is a lot of research going on to attempt to find out what exactly triggers this sometimes fatal reaction.  An NHS England report suggests in 2014, more than 123,000 people suffered from sepsis.  And it estimates around 37,000 people die from it in England each year.  Meanwhile, the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) published in November 2015, says sepsis kills more people than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined in the UK.  The enquiry suggests there are as many as 200,000 cases of sepsis a year in the UK, and up to 60,000 deaths.  But Dr Alex Goodwin, author of the NCEPOD report, says the numbers recorded by the NHS are likely to be an underestimate because of the way data is coded.  Responding to the case of William Mead, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said around 12,000 sepsis deaths a year may be avoidable.  Experts say the crux of the problem is that sepsis can have a number of faces.  In some cases, it can be very obvious that a patient has low blood pressure and a high temperature.  And patients might breathe rapidly and have a racing pulse, for example.  But early on, all these symptoms can be mistaken for influenza or other infections.  And added to this is the advice to GPs to make sure they don't prescribe antibiotics inappropriately - particularly for viral flu infections.  But without early treatment, sepsis can be fatal and every hour can count.  And in some cases, there can be very few obvious symptoms at all - until it is too late.  As the condition develops, symptoms may worsen and some more distinctive warning signs or "red flags" can emerge.  These vary from patient to patient, but after discussions with sepsis survivors the UK Sepsis Trust has compiled a list of the six most common signs.  A patient's blood pressure may plummet and red flags like these are signs that the body's organs, such as the lungs, brain and kidneys, are not getting enough blood and are beginning to fail.  In the case of babies and young children, some of these symptoms can present differently.  But experts caution it is important not to wait until red flags appear. And if they do, help must be sought immediately.  If spotted early, relatively simple treatment can be life-saving.  Patients may be given antibiotics and fluids through a drip. Oxygen may help too.  But once organs start to fail patients may need extra support in intensive care.  Experts say simple improvements could be made across the NHS to help prevent sepsis deaths.  The NCEPOD enquiry says there has been poor recording of patients' vital signs - their blood pressure and pulse for example - in both primary and hospital care.  Spotting a deterioration in these signs can help stop sepsis in its tracks.  The report recommends more doctors and nurses use early warning systems and screening checklists to prompt them to check for signs of sepsis.  NHS England published a wide-ranging sepsis action plan at the end of last year.  At the heart of it is the idea that staff across the NHS need to be trained to spot sepsis and be equipped to treat it correctly.  What is clear from the catalogue of failings highlighted by the case of William Mead is that this needs to apply to all frontline staff - from hospitals to helplines.  Last year, a campaign was set up in hospitals to help clinicians spot the signs quickly.  And Jeremy Hunt says a tool is now being developed to help better diagnosis of sepsis in primary care too.  When it comes to the helpline NHS 111, the health secretary says its algorithms need to be checked to make sure they are capable of flagging up sepsis.  Mr Hunt is also discussing the possibility of a public awareness campaign with Public Health England.  Meanwhile, more specific guidance for clinicians from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is due this year.	health

Philip Hammond said the talks "are number one on our Europe agenda" but the EU has "other issues on its plate".  It comes amid mounting speculation of a June vote after preparations for the referendum got under way on Tuesday.  Mr Hammond said a June date would be possible if a deal was agreed at next month's European Council summit.  But he stressed that it was more important to get the "right deal" rather than a "quick deal".  David Cameron is renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU, ahead of the vote to be held by the end of 2017.  One of the main sticking points in the talks, appears to be UK proposals to restrict EU migrants' access to benefits for four years - with some countries warning it amounts to discrimination.  Addressing the Lords EU Select Committee, Mr Hammond said: "We have to recognise the fact the European Union has got a couple of other issues on its plate and although the British renegotiation is number one our European agenda I'm afraid it isn't number one on the European agenda of any of our partners, except perhaps for the Irish."  He added: "Unfortunately some of the other things are very much real-time challenges for the EU whereas this agenda is one which can be dealt with in slightly slower time.  "I think it would be inappropriate of us, and it would also be unwise of us, to try and push our agenda ahead of other things which the other EU member states will see as being pressingly urgent to discuss at the summit," he added.  But the foreign secretary said the UK government was "confident" there would be a "substantive discussion" on the renegotiation at the meeting.  Mr Hammond told the committee that if a deal was secured "it will be possible to hold a referendum in June, if we chose to do so".  "If the deal is not done in February that would become much more difficult. Certainly, if it's not done in March it would become impossible".  Adding to speculation of a June referendum, the government laid a motion on Tuesday's Commons order papers setting out some of the rules of the referendum, such as the length of the campaign, funding and the timing of the count.  It means the provisions of the European Union Referendum Act - legislation passed last year paving the way for the vote - will come into force from next month.  BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move by the government was likely to face criticism from Eurosceptics given that Mr Cameron has not yet reached a deal with the EU over the reforms he is seeking.  It is thought the PM is anxious to have the rules approved by MPs as swiftly as possible - limiting the ability of people to delay the date of the referendum, he added.  Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has announced that registration for referendum campaigners will open on 1 February.  It applies to individuals and organisations planning to spend more than £10,000 promoting a certain outcome.  From this date, they must declare all donations and loans of more than £7,500. Campaigns must also check donations and loans are from eligible sources.  Any spending on campaigning prior to the start of the referendum period - which will be at least 10 weeks long - does not count towards a campaigner's spending limit.  Bob Posner, the Commission's director of party and electoral finance and legal counsel, said: "Campaigners are central to the referendum and it is important that their sources of funding and spending are transparent to voters.  "Having these provisions in place is part of enabling this."  Referendum timeline: What will happen when?

The virus has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains and has been spreading on a massive scale in the Americas.  UK officials say women can talk with health professionals about the risks.  If travel is unavoidable, they should take precautions to avoid bites from mosquitoes that spread the disease.  Women planning to become pregnant should also be wary, says the National Travel Health Network and Centre.  Any pregnant woman who has recently travelled to a country where Zika is known to occur should tell their doctor or midwife.  The UK Foreign Office says people can search its website by country or territory to find out the latest situation.  The World Health Organization says the virus is likely to spread across nearly all of the Americas, apart from Canada and Chile.  Three Britons have already contracted the virus after travelling to South and Central America.  A spokeswoman from UK travel organisation Abta said women reconsidering their plans would be able to get a medical certificate from their family doctor in order to claim on insurance.  US experts at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention say insect repellents containing active ingredients, such as DEET and picaridin, are safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  To lower the risk of infections spread by mosquitoes, pregnant women should use insect repellants, stay indoors during peak times of mosquito activity (usually dawn and dusk) and wear protective clothing (such as long-sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks).  Zika is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. The infection often occurs without symptoms but can cause an illness similar to dengue.  Patients usually get better on their own, but the big concern is the damage the virus might do to an unborn child.	health

William Mead, from Cornwall, died in 2014 from blood poisoning that had not been diagnosed by GPs or the NHS out-of-hours 111 helpline.  In response to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hunt apologised to William's parents.  He acknowledged that there were things that needed to be done better.  Mr Hunt told MPs: "Whilst any health system will inevitably suffer some tragedies, the issues in this case have significant implications for the rest of the NHS that I'm determined we should learn from."  Analysis: The wider lessons for the NHS  The official NHS England report into William's death, seen by the Daily Mail and BBC News, says William might have lived if NHS 111 call handers, who are not medically trained, had realised the seriousness of his condition.  If a medic had taken the final phone call instead they probably would have realised William's "cries as a child in distress" meant he needed urgent medical attention, it says.  It recommends 111 call advisers get more training in what questions to ask and when to escalate cases.  And GPs and the public are made more aware of blood poisoning or sepsis.  Staff at the local NHS 111 service that took Mrs Mead's call have since been given extra training to recognise when cases might be more complex and need referring up.  Mr Hunt said: "When you look at the totality of what the Mead family suffered, there is a confusion in the public mind which the NHS needs to address.  "The issue is that there are too many choices and you can't always get through quickly to the help you need. We need to improve the simplicity of the system so when you go to 111 you aren't asked a barrage of questions and you get the care you need more quickly."  He said all NHS 111 centres had expert clinicians on hand to give advice, and that it wasn't appropriate for every call to be answered by a doctor or a nurse. But he said he would look at whether NHS 111 might need more of these skilled staff.  Are you affected by the issues in this story? Let us know about your experiences.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35410646	Motorists caught using phones 'could face bigger penalties'	Drivers caught using hand-held mobiles could face tougher penalties under new plans being considered by ministers.  A Department for Transport consultation says the government's "preferred option" is to increase both penalty points and fines for offenders.  Launched on Tuesday, it cites research suggesting 9% of motorists regularly take "selfies" when behind the wheel.  The consultation will look at whether technology could put motorists' phones into a "drive-safe mode" automatically.  "These proposals ultimately aim to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads," says the government.  The measures relate directly to England and Wales but the document notes that its impact may apply in Scotland.  According to the document, 3,611 reported accidents between 2009-2014 "occurred where at least one driver" was on their phone, but it cautions this is likely to be "significantly under recorded".  Under proposals being considered to improve safety, the number of penalty points given to a motorist using their phone while driving could rise from three to four.  Drivers of Heavy Goods Vehicles could be handed up to six points on their licence.  First time offenders could continue to be offered the chance to attend police safety courses to avoid an endorsement on their licence.  The fine for using a phone whilst driving would also be raised, from £100 to £150.  The document admits that a previous increase in the fine in 2013 - which took it from £60 to £100 - had "no statistically significant change to the number of drivers observed using a hand-held mobile phone from 2009-2014". But it says a bigger fine would "act as a further deterrent for offending behaviour".  Taken together, the changes would "send a clear message on the seriousness of the offence" and reduce "the number of times and offender needed to be caught before being disqualification", it adds.  The consultation - which closes on 15 March - will also look at whether technology could be used to dissuade motorists from using their phones when they are behind the wheel.  Some technologies, it says, enable a phone to detect that it is moving faster (often at about 5-6mph) and divert the handset to a "drive safe mode".  This prevents it from ringing and in some cases can send a text informing the caller or texter that the recipient is driving.  "Much behaviour change work has shown that making it easier for people to do the right thing - in this case, not using a mobile phone whilst driving - can reap significant results.  "For example, putting fresh fruit and vegetables at the start of the school lunch choices has made it easier for children to pick a healthy school lunch.  "Similarly, it would seem logical to conclude that if a driver did not hear their phone ring, they would be less tempted to answer it," the consultation adds.  However, it notes there are potential "difficulties" with such technology, for example for passengers in a car and for people travelling on trains.  The government's consultation cites research from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which suggested that 9% of drivers regularly take "selfies" while driving.  Its director of policy and research, Neil Greig, said: "For many, smartphone use has become an addiction that we can only start to cure through some form of therapy.  "The IAM does not object to tougher penalties but we do believe that the real deterrent is fear of being caught. That fear can only be increased by increasing the numbers of traffic police on our roads."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35409261	Balloon 'last chance treatment' for heart failure	Scientists have used a pioneering balloon technique as a "last chance" treatment to help a patient with severe heart failure.  Richard Reach, 59, had the balloon device implanted to close off a leaky heart valve, after he was told he was too unwell to have open heart surgery.  Doctors at King's College Hospital say the procedure allowed him to improve enough to have more permanent surgery.  With further trials, the device could help thousands more patients, they say.  Mr Reach, a builder from Kent, suffered severe heart failure after a heart attack - leaving him extremely unwell and short of breath.  The damage to his heart meant one of his heart valves no longer worked properly, creating a backflow of blood and putting extra strain on his heart.  But when conventional treatment was deemed too high a risk, doctors decided to ask UK regulators for permission to try the new Mitra-Spacer device on compassionate grounds.  Made in the United States, by company Cardiosolutions, it had previously been tested only in pigs.  Mr Reach had the device implanted in June 2015 and was allowed home just a few days later.  Five months later, Mr Reach's heart had recovered enough for surgeons to carry out a conventional operation to repair the valve.  Mr Reach said: "Just as it seemed the medical team had run out of options Prof Wendler suggested the new treatment.  "Now I'm walking around and feeling better each day. What the team has done for me is nothing short of a miracle.  "I owe my life to them."  Prof Wendler, head of the surgical team that carried out the operation, believes the device could replace open heart surgery for some patients with damaged heart valves.  He said: "You always have concerns about doing first-in-man procedures but the most important thing is to make sure we carry on and do proper studies."  He will now be involved in large-scale international trials.  Heart failure affects around 1.5% of the UK population. Prof Wendler estimates some 5%-10% of patients have severe heart failure involving their heart valves and could benefit from this type of procedure.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35403822	NHS 111 'missed chances to save sepsis baby William Mead'	Doubts have been raised about whether England's NHS out-of-hours helpline is able to identify serious illnesses in children, after a baby died of blood poisoning following a chest infection.  NHS 111 call handlers are not medically trained, and a report on the 2014 death of William Mead, from Cornwall, said he might have lived if they had realised the seriousness of his condition.  The NHS England report said GPs had also failed to diagnose him.  It urged better recognition of sepsis.  But it said that if a medic had taken the final phone call, instead of an NHS 111 adviser using a computer system, they probably would have realised William's "cries as a child in distress" meant he needed urgent medical attention.  Melissa Mead, William's mother, said doctors told her "not to worry" and NHS 111 said "it's nothing serious" before her son's death.  Speaking about sepsis, she said "hardly anyone knows what it is" and called for better awareness among GPs and parents.  Analysis: The wider lessons for the NHS  At that time, the cause of death was put down to natural causes, but a coroner's inquest in June 2015 found he had died from treatable blood poisoning - known as septicaemia - caused by a long-standing chest infection.  Mrs Mead had taken him to the GP numerous times in the months leading up to his death.  The report, seen by the Daily Mail and BBC News, details the opportunities missed to save William's life. It found:  "Had any of these different courses of action been taken, William would probably have survived," the report said.  It said call advisers needed to be trained to spot when there was a need to probe further and when to escalate cases.  It also called for better recognition by GPs of the signs and symptoms of septicaemia.  Lindsey Scott, director of nursing with NHS England in the South West, said: "Everyone involved in this report is determined to make sure lessons are learned from William's death, so other families don't have to go through the same trauma.  "None of this detracts from our profound regret at the loss of William. For that loss, on behalf of all NHS organisations involved, I would like to apologise publicly to Mr and Mrs Mead."  She said staff at the local NHS 111 service had since been given extra training to recognise when cases might be more complex and need referring up.  Mrs Mead said: "We are glad the report has shown up there were failures and missed opportunities. We hope from the recommendations made this never happens again.  "We fought the hardest battle to get answers, knowing we had already lost William."  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was a "tragic case" and apologised for the "serious failings".  He said: "The recommendations are far far-reaching with national implications.  "When you look at the totality of what the Mead family suffered, there is a confusion in the public mind which the NHS needs to address.  "The issue is that there are too many choices and you can't always get through quickly to the help you need. We need to improve the simplicity of the system so when you go to 111 you aren't asked a barrage of questions and you get the care you need more quickly."  He said there had already been a renewed push to educate GPs on the signs of sepsis, but that there was also scope for a public awareness campaign.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35410822	The wider lessons of William's death	Much of the attention over the tragic death of 12-month-old William Mead has focussed on the role of NHS 111.  That is understandable. The report into his care highlights a series of missed opportunities by the call handler who William's mother spoke to on the day before he died. It makes it clear the handler should have probed more for information about his condition and immediately referred it on to a nurse or doctor.  This is just the latest in a long line for criticism for the telephone triage and advice service since it was rolled out three years ago. Much of it has focussed on the decision to reduce the ratio of nurses and doctors to call handlers when compared to its predecessor service, NHS Direct.  The lack of clinical training means the report excused the call handler from being guilty of a "serious failings". That doesn't mean though that the way the system works does not need reviewing - and NHS England's head office is already saying it will look into whether it needs to change the processes that are followed.  But the report, produced by NHS England's south west office, also details other problems - and they have implications for the wider health service.  William, from Cornwall, had been ill for six to eight weeks before he died and had been seen by GPs at his local practice six times before his death. They too missed opportunities to diagnose a chest infection and pneumonia which led to the sepsis that killed him.  One of the visits was made two days before his death when his heart rate was not taken. It says it should have been.  By this point the sepsis would have taken hold and so, in all likelihood, William's heart rate would have been raised and, if indentified, should have led to him being referred for help.  The report excuses individuals of blame - and repeatedly makes the point that sepsis is often difficult to spot. But it does raise the question of whether these missed opportunities were a result of the pressures being placed on GPs, particularly not to make referrals to under-strain hospitals or prescribe antibiotics.  The actions of the out-of-hours GP who got in touch with the parents following the NHS 111 call was also highlighted. This was on a Saturday, the day before he died. The medic advised William's mother to let him sleep. If the medic had had access to William's medical records he might have insisted on seeing William.  But the goal of achieving fully shared patient records across the NHS is still one that has not been met despite repeated attempts.  Finally, the report raises the issue of services at weekends - and the support people get. Both the GP practice and out-of-hours doctors told William's parents to get back in touch if his condition worsened. But the investigators felt this was too vague, especially given the limited medical help available at weekends.  NHS bosses are now promising the lessons will be learned from William's death. His mother, Melissa, says they have to be.	health

Number 10 said both leaders saw there was genuine goodwill across Europe for Mr Cameron's aims, but accepted there was work to do to find solutions.  A spokesman said they also discussed migration and the Syria conference they will co-host in London next week.  The UK is to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017.  Mr Cameron has pledged to secure a better deal for the UK in the European Union as a prelude to the referendum, in which voters will be asked whether they want to stay in the EU or leave.  There has been speculation that the PM could call the poll as early as June this year if he gets the backing of the EU's other 27 leaders for his reform demands at a summit in February.  Downing Street also said that while discussing migration during their call, both Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel agreed that a strong external European border and close co-operation with Turkey were vital.  And they agreed that the Syria conference had "the potential to deliver a substantial increase in both financial and practical support for refugees that would help them to stay in the region".

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35400046	Recovery position 'a must for unconscious children and babies'	Doctors are reminding the public that unconscious infants and children should be put in the recovery position.  The advice follows a European study that found dangerous manoeuvres, such as slapping, were often used instead.  Only a quarter of the 553 children in the study were put into the recommended first-aid position that keeps the airway clear and open.  Nearly half were instead shaken, slapped or had water flicked on their face in an attempt to bring them round.  Putting the child in the recovery position was associated with a significantly lower risk - 28% - of hospital admission, the Archives of Disease in Childhood study found.  In comparison, potentially dangerous manoeuvres appeared to double the risk - probably because the patients didn't recover as quickly, according to the study authors.  How to do it:  How to put someone in the recovery position  Lead researcher Dr Luigi Titomanlio said, ideally, everyone should know how to place an infant, child or adult in the recovery position.  "It is so simple to do. It's a simple manoeuvre that can be performed by even a six-year-old."  He said it was understandable that parents might panic if their child has a fit or faint and loses consciousness and that is when first aid training should kick in.  "What was really worrying was that some parents were shaking their baby. This is dangerous. You can have brain damage from this, especially in children less than two years old," he said.  "People should use the recovery position. You can do it even in a baby. The important thing is getting the chin in the right position to protect the airway."  Dr Ffion Davies, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: "It would be great if studies like this prompt more parents to learn some basic first aid.  "It would not only help in situations of crisis but also give parents peace of mind that they are a little more prepared if faced with an emergency."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35403827	Rise in serious incidents at English mental health trusts	More than 8,000 serious incidents were reported by mental health trusts in England last year - an increase of more than a third over a three-year period.  The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Liberal Democrats, include a rise in unexpected deaths and suicides.  The NHS logs events as "serious incidents" when the consequences for patients and staff are so significant they warrant investigations.  The NHS said transparency had improved.  Trusts are left to decide for themselves what constitutes a serious incident, working under guidelines from NHS England.  Apart from unexpected deaths, a serious incident investigation might also be triggered by events that could undermine public confidence in an organisation's ability to deliver acceptable healthcare services - such as security concerns or the misuse of information.  The aim is to prevent future tragedies.  The Freedom of Information data from NHS England shows there were 8,139 serious incidents recorded by the 58 mental health trusts in England in 2014-15.  This compares with 6,074 in 2012-13 and 7,345 in 2013-14.  Two trusts failed to provide full information for 2012-13. Taking account of this, there was an underlying increase of 31% over the whole period.  Of the serious incidents, there were 1,714 unexpected deaths in 2014-15, an underlying increase of 20%.  These death figures include 751 suicides - up 22% from 2012-13.  It is possible that a more open culture has encouraged a higher level of incident reporting - with a greater emphasis on safety since Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was heavily criticised for failings of care that may have led to unnecessary deaths.  But the Liberal Democrats say the figures generate further concerns about mental health services in England, following December's revelations about Southern Health.  The trust, which provides mental health services in the south of England, was found to have failed to investigate the unexpected deaths of hundreds of patients, many with mental health conditions and learning disabilities, since 2011.  The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, a former health minister in the coalition government, said: "These findings raise really serious concerns. I believe they should trigger a full investigation by the government and by NHS England.  "On the face of it, they show a dramatic rise in unexpected deaths and suicides - at a time when real terms funding provided by commissioning groups has gone down."  An NHS England spokesperson said: "Reporting of incidents is intentionally up right across the NHS, including mental health, as part of our national effort to encourage transparency and a culture of learning.  "That's the lesson from the airlines - openness is a precondition for safety and improvement. That's as true for mental health services as it is for maternity care or surgical operations."  Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the Mental Health Network, said: "We all need to make sure more people feel able to talk about mental health problems openly and get access to the support they need by reducing the stigma that surround mental illness."	health

Peers voted by a majority of 92 to amend the Welfare Reform and Work Bill to make ministers report annually on income levels in the poorest families.  The move was spearheaded by the Bishop of Durham, Rt Rev Paul Butler, who argued income-related statistics must be recorded so they could be assessed with other measurements of deprivation.  Ministers say life chances are a better measure of economic outcomes.  The defeat could be overturned when the bill returns to the Commons later this year.  If it is not, ministers will be obliged to present a report to Parliament each year setting out the percentage of children in households whose net income is 60% to 70% below the median average.  The government's decision to change how child poverty is measured, to focus on the root causes of poverty rather than income disparities, has angered opposition parties and anti-poverty campaigners  But ministers insist that income benchmarks put in place by the last Labour government painted a false picture and meant that inter-generational factors holding families back, such as unemployment and low educational attainment, were ignored.  Bishop Butler said he conceded income levels should not be the only measure of levels of relative poverty but were still highly significant.  "It is also possible to understate the importance of income, or the lack of it, especially among those of us who have plenty," he said.  "There is also a wealth of academic evidence pointing to the damaging effect income poverty has on children's wellbeing, including their health, education and future employment prospects."  While he was not seeking to reinstate an income-based definition of child poverty, the bishop said his proposal would ensure income was measured and reported on an equal basis to other social indicators.  Ministers insist the move is not needed as income-related statistics would still be collated.  Welfare minister Lord Freud said, on their own, income figures were at best a "partial reflection" of an individual's economic wellbeing, and did not take into account levels of debt and savings, employment histories and increased school spending in areas of the highest deprivation.  During Monday's report stage debate on the Welfare Bill, ministers also announced that the government would be exempting recipients of carer's allowance from the overall household benefit cap, which is set to fall to a maximum of £20,000 outside London and £23,00 in the capital.  Lord Freud said the government valued the contribution carers made to society and was taking further steps to support them.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35404709	Syria: Pickles urges help for 'at risk' refugee children	Political pressure is continuing to grow on the government to take in thousands of unaccompanied refugee children who have made it into Europe.  Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles said those "at risk" should be treated with "Christian spirit".  Former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said there was a strong humanitarian case to help those "in limbo".  Ministers say no decision has been made but charities want the UK to admit 3,000 minors from Syria and elsewhere.  Last year, an estimated 26,000 children arrived in Europe without their families.  Many had simply disappeared and were at risk of falling prey to people-traffickers, drug dealers and other abusers, Save the Children said.  The charity wants the UK to take in a further 3,000 unaccompanied children, in addition to the 20,000 refugees the UK has already pledged to take direct from refugee camps over the next five years.  Speaking in a debate in the House of Commons, Sir Eric, the former Communities and Local Government Secretary, who is now the UK's anti-Semitism envoy, said he was pleased the issue was being looked at again.  "He is quite right to try and keep children in the region, but to use the world's phrases, 'we are where we are', he said of Prime Minister David Cameron.  "There are children out there who are at risk, and I would urge the government to look carefully about this.  "After all this is 25 January - a month ago we were celebrating that great Christian festival of children, and I hope that that spirit lingers beyond Boxing Day."  Speaking after meeting interior ministers from other EU nations, in Amsterdam, Home Secretary Theresa May said Europe was "struggling to cope" and every nation needed to do its bit.  "Together with my counterparts from France and Germany, I made the case for urgent action, not just to deal with the immediate crisis, but also to resolve the situation in the longer term," she said.  "Unfortunately, what we've had is more talk than action.  "And we need urgently to work together to ensure that we can have proper processing at Europe's external borders, that we're returning illegal migrants, and that we're working up-stream in transit and origin countries."  On the issue of whether to prioritise child refugees, Mrs May said the UK's thinking would be driven by "the best interests of the child".  A "variety of options" was being examined, she added.  Earlier this month, Mr Cameron told the Commons he was considering the issue "in good faith", and the BBC understands he has yet to make up his mind whether to take more refugees.  Some warn taking in more lone children could lead to subsequent demands for their relatives to be brought to Britain - but Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems are asking the UK to do more.  Raising the matter in an urgent question in the House of Commons, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said reception centres and children's homes in a number of European countries were overflowing and refugee children "disappearing".  "We hear rumours that the government will only be looking at helping child refugees from camps in the region," she said. "That is not enough."  In response, Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said the issue remained under review.  "Such a serious issue, potentially affecting the lives of so many, must be considered thoroughly, and no decisions have been taken yet," he said.  "The government is clear that any action to help and assist unaccompanied minors must be in the best interests of the child, and it is right that that is our primary concern."  Kent County Council has already warned it will not be able to accept any more unaccompanied children, saying its children's services are facing "enormous pressure" and have run out of foster beds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35403880	Obituary: Cecil Parkinson	As Conservative Party chairman in 1983, Cecil Parkinson was given much credit for his party's landslide election victory that year. But by the time of the party conference in the autumn, the scandal over his affair with his secretary Sara Keays - who was pregnant with his child - forced his dramatic resignation.  Cecil Parkinson was a political shooting star, who rose from humble beginnings to a point at which many saw him as a future prime minister - until the scandal that engulfed him.  He had previously succeeded as a businessman, a government minister and as the Conservative Party's most attractive, high-powered public relations man. He possessed charm, flair for organisation and political sophistication.  Born at Carnforth, in Lancashire, Cecil Parkinson was the son of a railwayman and in his youth he was left-wing, a pacifist and considered becoming a clergyman.  He attended the local grammar school before studying at Cambridge, where he graduated with a third in law. At this point his interest in politics seemed to have disappeared and he moved south to work in the City of London, where he became a chartered accountant.  It was his marriage - in 1957 to Ann Jarvis, the daughter of a rich builder in Harpenden, Hertfordshire - that pointed him in the direction of the Conservative Party. His wife was an ardent Conservative, and her father helped to set up Lord Parkinson in the business world.  Elected to Parliament in a by-election in 1970, he represented the constituency of Enfield West and subsequently Hertfordshire South and Hertsmere, seats which were affected by boundary redistributions.  In 1974 he was made a whip and promoted to spokesman on trade two years later. Following the party's election victory in 1979 he was appointed a junior minister at the Department of Trade.  At that point he was still virtually unknown outside Westminster and not that well-known inside it, but all that changed in 1981 when Mrs Thatcher made him party chairman - an appointment which catapulted him into the top ranks of the party.  He was also given the post of Paymaster General and a seat in the cabinet, and a year later he became chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  These rapid promotions led many to see him as a pawn of the prime minister, especially when he was made a member of the "War Cabinet" during the Falklands crisis.  But he proved that he, better than anyone else, could go before the television cameras and - in a relaxed, reasonable and appealing manner - tell the nation what the government was up to; something he did to great effect.  Lord Parkinson's greatest triumph, however, was the 1983 election campaign, which was a model of discipline, timing, co-ordination and organisation. For this he was rightly given most of the credit, and when the new government was formed he was given the post of trade and industry secretary.  It was reported that Mrs Thatcher intended to make him foreign secretary as a reward for masterminding the victory, had it not been for what came next. His secret affair with Miss Keays, and the revelation that she was pregnant with his child, became public knowledge - during the Conservative Party's 1983 autumn conference.  He issued a statement admitting that he had offered to marry Ms Keays at one time, but added that he had later changed his mind, and was staying with his wife. He promised to make adequate financial arrangements for the child, and he firmly denied he was going to resign.  When he addressed the party conference he got a sympathetic, if somewhat lukewarm, reception. He seemed to have survived the storm.  But it was Ms Keays' statement to The Times - designed, she said, to "put the record straight" on their relationship - that ultimately resulted in his demise. It appeared on the final day of the conference, and revealed facts which Cecil Parkinson's statement had omitted. He immediately resigned his government post, though he remained an MP.  An influential figure with Mrs Thatcher, he was regarded as one of her close private friends. Over the next few years there were regular reports that she was anxious to bring him back into the government, but his return was opposed by some senior ministers.  It was probably delayed also by Sara Keays, who made sure she and her baby daughter remained in the public mind. She wrote a book, published in the autumn of 1985, giving details of her 12-year affair with Lord Parkinson, and implying that he had told her government secrets. Scotland Yard was asked to investigate, and later the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that no action was being taken.  Ms Keays's book was serialised in newspapers. She later gave magazine interviews and appeared on television. Lord Parkinson was also hit by another personal issue: his eldest daughter developed a heroin addiction.  However, he was re-elected in 1987 with an increased majority and brought back into the cabinet as energy secretary, to prepare the electricity industry for privatisation.  Two years later he took over transport, which had become something of a political hot seat, after much criticism of Paul Channon's handling of a series of rail and air disasters, and particularly airport security.  Almost inevitably he, too, suffered criticism, but he did manage to win from the Treasury a substantial increase in the money available for improving Britain's roads and railways.  One of his arch-critics was Labour's chief transport spokesman, John Prescott, whom Lord Parkinson denounced for his attitude to transport tragedies. He was a political vulture, he said, with an almost obscene passion for television appearances.  Lord Parkinson resigned as soon as John Major succeeded Mrs Thatcher as prime minister, but he said he was delighted the party had elected such a fine leader to succeed her, and promised him his total support from the backbenches.  Lord Parkinson stepped down as an MP in 1992 and was elevated to the House of Lords.  While that might have been expected to be the end of his career in frontline politics, he returned to the fray in 1997 when William Hague asked him to rerun his previous role of party chairman after their election defeat.  But in the end that role - where two of the younger Conservatives who worked for him were George Osborne and David Cameron - only lasted until 1999 when he retired and, barring the occasional media interview, was rarely back in the political spotlight.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35403445	Ex-Conservative chairman Cecil Parkinson dies aged 84	Cecil Parkinson has died aged 84 after what his family said was "a long battle with cancer".  As Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, he played a key role in the Tories' 1983 general election victory.  Lord Parkinson quit the cabinet soon after when it emerged his ex-secretary Sara Keays was carrying his child.  Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "a man of huge ability" who had helped transform the UK in the 1980s.  Paying tribute in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said he had "learnt a lot" from Lord Parkinson at the start of his political career, describing him as part of "a great political generation that really did extraordinary things for our country".  As they confirmed his death, a family spokesman said: "We shall miss him enormously. As a family, we should like to pay tribute to him as a beloved husband to Ann and brother to Norma, and a supportive and loving father to Mary, Emma and Joanna and grandfather to their children.  "We also salute his extraordinary commitment to British public life as a member of parliament, cabinet minister and peer - together with a distinguished career in business."  The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said Cecil Parkinson was one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies but said that his career was "undone" by the scandal that engulfed him following his affair with Ms Keays.  The former chartered accountant and businessman was central to Margaret Thatcher's political agenda and achievements in office, he added.  Lord Parkinson was in the front rank of Conservative politics for three decades, first being elected to Parliament in 1970.  After becoming a junior minister after Margaret Thatcher's 1979 election victory, he swiftly rose through the ranks and was named party chairman and elevated to the cabinet in 1981. He was a member of the war cabinet during the 1982 Falklands conflict.  He was tipped to be named foreign secretary after overseeing the Tories' landslide election victory in 1983. But he was given the more junior role of trade and industry secretary and it later emerged he had fathered a child with his former secretary, prompting him to resign in October 1983.  Former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo said this scandal had "definitely held back his career" but the fact that he was offered a cabinet post at all was testament to his closeness to the PM.  Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said Lord Parkinson would have been "the most natural candidate" to succeed Margaret Thatcher had events not turned out in the way they did.  "John Major eventually filled the gap that Cecil Parkinson would have had," he told the BBC News Channel. "But Cecil Parkinson was in reality a Thatcherite while John Major, as Margaret Thatcher eventually discovered, was not nearly as close to her, as she had hoped and assumed".  The former prime minister regarded Cecil Parkinson as "one of us", Mr Rifkind added: "He shared her views, thoughts and ideas. She was comfortable with him and had confidence in him, In addition, at a personal level, he was able to charm her."  After being brought back into government by Margaret Thatcher in 1987, Cecil Parkinson served as energy and transport secretaries.  He stood down as an MP in 1992 and was elevated to the House of Lords. He briefly made a comeback as Tory Party chairman, under William Hague, after the party's general election hammering in 1997.  Lord Hague described him as "an exceptional talent and an extraordinarily nice man to work with".  Current members of the government have also been paying tribute. Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: "Sad to hear of death of Cecil Parkinson. I worked with him when he was party chairman in 1997-8 - he was there in our hour of greatest need."  And former minister Alan Duncan said Lord Parkinson was "personable, amusing, easy-going and mischievously witty". "He started as Margaret Thatcher's great marketing man for overseas trade and turned into one of the great personalities of the Thatcher era," he said.  When the scandal over Cecil Parkinson's infidelity broke during the 1983 Conservative Party conference, Ms Keays claimed the politician had agreed to leave his wife Ann for her.  In her book, A Question Of Judgement, Ms Keays claimed that the then Mr Parkinson had "begged" her to have an abortion and that he had "haggled over every pound" of financial support for their daughter Flora.  But the Conservative politician insisted that he had voluntarily made more than adequate provision for Flora - who was diagnosed at an early age with learning disabilities and asperger's syndrome, and had an operation to remove a brain tumour when she was four.  In 1993, Cecil Parkinson and Sara Keays secured an injunction to prevent any information being published about Flora or her schooling until she turned 18. The court order was designed to protect her privacy but was later disowned by Miss Keays.  In an interview in 2002, after the gagging order had expired, Flora Keays said her father had "behaved very badly" towards her and her mother but hoped that one day he would become "part of our lives".	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35399403	Zika virus: Outbreak 'likely to spread across Americas' says WHO	The Zika virus is likely to spread across nearly all of the Americas, the World Health Organization has warned.  The infection, which causes symptoms including mild fever, conjunctivitis and headache, has already been found in 21 countries in the Caribbean, North and South America.  It has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains and some countries have advised women not to get pregnant.  No treatment or vaccine is available.  The virus was first detected in 1947 in monkeys in Africa. There have since been small, short-lived outbreaks in people on the continent, parts of Asia and in the Pacific Islands.  But it has spread on a massive scale in the Americas, where transmission was first detected in Brazil in May 2015.  Large numbers of the mosquitoes which carry the virus and a lack of any natural immunity is thought to be helping the infection to spread rapidly.  Zika is transmitted by the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, which are found in all countries in the region except Canada and Chile.  In a statement, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the regional office of the WHO, said: "PAHO anticipates that Zika virus will continue to spread and will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found."  PAHO is advising people to protect themselves from the mosquitoes, which also spread dengue fever and chikungunya.  It also confirmed the virus had been detected in semen and there was "one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission" but further evidence was still needed.  Around 80% of infections do not result in symptoms.  But the biggest concern is the potential impact on babies developing in the womb. There have been around 3,500 reported cases of microcephaly - babies born with tiny brains - in Brazil alone since October.  PAHO warned pregnant women to be "especially careful" and to see their doctor before and after visiting areas affected by the virus.  Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica last week recommended women delay pregnancies until more was known about the virus.  Although officially PAHO says "any decision to defer pregnancy is an individual one between a woman, her partner and her healthcare provider".  Maria Conceicao Queiroz said there was a sense of fear where she lives near the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro: "Every one is at risk, we're all scared of getting Zika.  "We're surrounded with dirty water, polluted water, but what can we do but put repellent on, to try to keep the mosquitoes away."  Prof Laura Rodrigues, a fellow of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said some data suggested that up to one-in-fifty babies had birth defects in one of the worst hit areas - Pernambuco state in Brazil.  She said: "Until November we knew nothing, this has caught us by surprise and we're trying to learn as fast as we can.  "Wherever there is dengue, there is mosquito, then it will spread and not just in Americas I think there is a very real chance it will spread in Asia."  PAHO advice is to ensure all containers that can hold even small amounts of water should be emptied and cleaned to prevent mosquitoes breeding.  And that people should protect themselves by using insect repellent, covering up and keeping windows and doors closed.  The director general of the WHO, Margaret Chan, said the outbreak was "extremely worrisome".	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35398568	Osborne and Gates pledge cash to beat malaria	Chancellor George Osborne and philanthropist Bill Gates have announced £3bn in funding over the next five years to tackle malaria.  Britain will give £500m a year from its overseas aid budget. And The Gates Foundation will give $200m (£140m) this year, with other donations of at least £110m to follow in the next five years.  The aim is to eradicate the disease.  The number of people dying from malaria is falling, but a child still dies from the disease every minute in Africa.  There were 438,000 malaria deaths in 2015, most of them of children aged under five, according to the World Health Organization.  Drugs can treat malaria, and bed nets, insecticides and repellents can help stop mosquitoes, which transmit malaria, biting.  But a quarter of children in sub-Saharan Africa still live in a household with no insecticide-treated mosquito nets and no indoor spraying with safe, long-lasting insecticides.  The malaria parasite has also begun to develop resistance to currently available insecticides and drugs.  "We want to end malaria in our lifetimes". It's a bold ambition from chancellor George Osborne and philanthropist and billionaire Bill Gates. There have been great successes in the fight against one of the world's biggest killers, with the number of deaths more than halving since 2000.  But some of the key tools the world has to fight the disease are becoming less effective, which is why research and development of new drugs is so important. The British government says the cash could help "nearly eliminate" malaria in the next 15 years. But wiping out malaria completely is likely to take much longer, and cost far more.  Scientists are hopeful they will find new treatments and preventive methods that could eliminate malaria by 2040.  Speaking at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, where scientists have identified new active ingredients that could form the basis of new insecticides, Mr Osborne said: "Tackling malaria at source, working with people like Bill Gates using Great Britain's science to do it helps Britain's national security as well as being the right thing to do to save lives in our world and that's exactly the combination that I would want to see our aid budget being used to deliver."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35402815	Labour 'in denial' about record warns election study	A review of why Labour lost the last election has suggested that the negative views of the party amongst swing voters were "deep and powerful".  The study, conducted by Gordon Brown's ex-pollster Deborah Mattinson, suggests voters believe Labour is "in denial" about its "appalling" economic record.  The findings suggest voters feel Labour is "in thrall to the undeserving".  Ms Mattinson has criticised the party's official report into its election defeat as a whitewash.  Labour said the Beckett report had "consulted far and wide", taking input from pollsters, pundits and academics, and would be acted upon.  The pollster undertook voter research to feed into Dame Margaret Beckett's report, which was published last week, but says her evidence was not published.  Her own review, commissioned by former deputy leader Harriet Harman, concludes Labour must now "atone for its past, especially on the economy", "be competent, especially on the economy" and "show it takes Scotland seriously".  It says Scots who voted SNP in 2015 see Labour as "indistinguishable from the Conservatives - just less competent".  It found that many English voters who voted Conservative in 2015 struggled to remember anything much about last year's general election campaign, although the televised debates were mentioned by most with David Cameron and the Tories seen as "repetitive and very bullish about the economy, whilst Ed Miliband was seen as a "dork", a view epitomised when he nearly fell off his podium at the end of one of the encounters.  The English voters said the Tories' assertion that Labour leader Ed Miliband, had he formed a government after the election, would have been bullied by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon rang true because Mr Miliband was seen as "bumbling and weak".  The report says Labour must acknowledge its problems, develop policies which are "genuinely aspirational and inclusive", show it is "not being taken for a ride by scroungers" and has a "clear and credible line on immigration".  The report's research was conducted in marginal constituencies in Croydon, Watford, Nuneaton, Edinburgh and Glasgow. No-one who voted Labour in 2015 was involved, with those questioned including former Labour voters and Conservative and SNP supporters aged between 30 and 50.  Speaking on Sunday, Ms Mattinson told the BBC she was "very concerned" that lessons from the election would not be learned and was "somewhat disappointed" that her research was not more fully reflected in the Beckett report.  Ms Mattinson, founder and director of research and strategy consultancy Britain Thinks, said voters "didn't trust Labour to manage the economy" and they "categorically" blamed the party for the 2008 financial crisis.  She also said people did not see Labour leader Ed Miliband as "prime ministerial". "If you look at every election since the '70s, what you see is that the party that has the leader with the best ratings is the party that wins. There's no exception to that," she added.  The Beckett report identified four main factors for Labour's defeat - leadership, trust on the economy, a lack of traction on immigration and welfare and the fear of a minority Labour government being propped up by the SNP. It said Labour faced a "huge challenge" to win again in 2020.  However, it said assumptions that Labour lost the election because it was too left-wing and because its policies were unpopular were overly simplistic and should be treated with caution, adding that the manifesto was an "impressive document."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35381466	UK is 'vulnerable' to next Ebola outbreak	The UK is vulnerable to epidemics such as Ebola because of a gaping hole in the country's ability to manufacture vaccines, a group of MPs has warned.  The Science and Technology Committee said the UK "lacks the capacity" to produce enough to protect people.  And they said the government's response to the Ebola outbreak was "undermined by systematic delay".  The government said its "swift" action had saved lives and steps had been taken for an effective future response.  More than 11,000 people died in West Africa in the largest-ever outbreak of Ebola.  MPs praised the "heroic" efforts of the volunteers who often put their own lives on the line to tackle the epidemic.  But their report warned: "We are also concerned that, in the unlikely but possible event of a domestic outbreak, the UK lacks the capability to go further and manufacture enough vaccines to vaccinate UK citizens in an emergency.  "Existing facilities are degraded and new plants will take years to build, leaving the UK in a vulnerable position."  The concern is that should a disease such as Ebola spread around the world then countries would look after their own interests first, making it hard for the UK to get hold of vaccines.  Prof Adrian Hill, who was involved in trialling Ebola vaccines at Oxford University, described the lack of vaccine manufacturing as a "national security issue".  Those concerns were echoed by the chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, who told the committee that "we are looking at how we can try and attract companies back".  The report also said "delays were evident at every stage of our response" to the crisis.  It pointed to research suggesting 12,500 cases of Ebola would have been prevented if treatment centres were set up just one month earlier.  And there was again criticism of the decision to set up screening at UK airports, contrary to recommendations from the World Health Organization.  Nicola Blackwood, the chairwoman of the committee, said: "The UK response to Ebola - like the international one - was undermined by systematic delay.  "The government's emergency response procedures were triggered far too late in the day, Ebola test kits were developed and trialled, but not deployed, and the initial response was ad hoc and uncoordinated.  "A combination of hard work and chance prevented Ebola spreading further than it did, but a future epidemic may be less containable and spread within the UK as well as overseas.  "We must take the opportunity now to ensure that the UK is not caught unprepared when the next disease emergency strikes. Lives can be lost for every day of delay."  A Department of Health spokesman said: "We have already taken steps to ensure an even more effective response in future.  "This includes the £1bn Ross Fund for infectious disease research, the UK Vaccine Network to target the most threatening diseases, and a rapid response team of public health professionals who can be deployed within 48 hours to investigate a disease outbreak in a developing country."	health

Persistent exhaustion was found to affect 2% of 16-year-olds - and almost twice as many girls as boys.  Children from poorer families were also more likely to have the condition.  The Bristol study, published in Pediatrics, asked more than 5,700 parents and their children about their experiences of persistent exhaustion.  Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME, is a debilitating disease which has a major impact on the lives of those affected. It causes persistent fatigue that does not go away with rest or sleep.  This large population study found that one in 50 16-year-olds have CFS/ME lasting more than six months and nearly one in 33 have CFS/ME persisting for more than three months.  Yet only one in 1,000 are diagnosed with the condition.  In the study, those with CFS/ME missed, on average, more than half a day of school every week.  Boys and girls appeared to be equally affected at the age of 13, but by the time they were 16, CFS/ME was more common in girls.  Children from families with poor housing, financial difficulties and a lack of support for their mother were more likely to report problems of severe fatigue.  The study authors said this dispelled the commonly held view that CFS/ME was a "middle-class" illness, or "yuppie flu".  The diagnoses of the condition in the study were based on responses to questionnaires sent to teenagers and their parents, and were not made by a doctor.  Dr Esther Crawley, senior report author and consultant paediatrician specialising in CFS/ME, said treatment for teenagers with the condition was effective but few had access to treatment in the UK.  "Children attending my specialist service only attend two days a week of school on average. This means that only the most severe cases are getting help.  "As paediatricians, we need to get better at identifying CFS/ME, particularly in those children from disadvantaged backgrounds who may be less able to access specialist care."  She said experts still did not know exactly why or how the condition is triggered, but research showed it could be successfully treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in young people.  Sonya Chowdhury, chief executive of Action for ME, said the study pointed to the need for more effective treatments.  "We know from contact with the parents of children with ME that this disabling condition impacts on every area of family life.  "The reality is that many young people miss considerably more than half a day of school a week, while for the most severely affected, their disabling symptoms are compounded by the isolation and loss that comes with being housebound and/or bedbound."	health

The plan has been in the pipeline for some time - it was originally going to be published last autumn.  But even at this late stage there's still fierce debate within Whitehall about what should be in it.  At the heart of the debate is the merit, or otherwise, of a sugar tax. Health experts have been campaigning hard for one to be introduced - and even the government advisory body Public Health England has put a case for it.  But for much of the time since the election, ministers have been resistant. Until recently. There are now signs they're coming round to the idea. This much is obvious from the change in tone from the prime minister himself.  Earlier this month, he said he wasn't ruling out a tax, which is somewhat different from last year's statements that he "doesn't see a need" for it.  This should not come as a surprise: David Cameron's government has form on changing its mind when it comes to these sort of health dilemmas. During the last Parliament, ministers proposed plain packaging for cigarettes, then appeared to go cold on it before agreeing it was necessary.  A similar flip-flopping could be said to have happened over minimum pricing for alcohol (although that is still in the pending box as no final decision has been made).  Conservatives are naturally wary of introducing new taxes and accusations of the nanny state.  So what has influenced government thinking this time? The delay in publication has certainly allowed the experts to mount a vigorous campaign.  As well as the normal array of doctors and health chiefs, TV chef Jamie Oliver has also waded in. He set up an e-petition which saw more than 150,000 people backing a sugar tax.  Meanwhile, NHS bosses have already announced they will be introducing their own "tax" in hospitals.  Understandably, no government wants to get caught on the wrong side of popular opinion.  But I'm also told that ministers have started to be persuaded by the evidence. One in five children is obese by the time they finish primary school. Include those classed as overweight and the figure jumps to one in three.  Children consume three times as much sugar as they should - with a third of that coming from fizzy drinks. And there is evidence it will work. In Mexico, consumption fell by 6% after a tax of 10% was introduced.  The impact of the 5p plastic bag charge is also in their minds.  But, of course, the obesity strategy is not just about a tax. Other measures, including a crackdown on shop promotions and advertising (again not natural territory for Tories) as well as a sustained drive to reduce the sugar content of food are also in the mix.  There will be measures to get people more active too, although the emphasis will be very much on diet as there is an acknowledgement that without curbing calories there is a limit to what physical activity can do.  It will be, in effect, an acknowledgement that society is geared too much towards unhealthy lifestyles.  This much is clear from the way we consume food. Just look at food promotions, which are heavily weighted towards unhealthy products. About 40% of expenditure on food goes on promotions, causing us to purchase a fifth more than we would have otherwise, according to PHE.  The result is an unhealthy diet. Last week, researchers at the Food Foundation produced a model of the typical family's diet.  Every member of the average family consumed too much sugar and saturated fat and too little of the good stuff - fibre, fruit and vegetables and oily fish. What is more, all but the youngest members were eating too much red and processed meat and salt.  It's no wonder that some in the field are describing obesity as the "new smoking" - and ministers are, bit by bit, being convinced.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35383057	Toxic paint levels at playgrounds, research suggests	Paint on playground equipment has been found to contain high amounts of the toxin lead - up to 40 times recommended levels, research suggests.  The study - published in the journal Science of the Total Environment - said the levels may pose a significant risk to young children.  Scientists from Plymouth University tested the content of paints on play equipment at 50 parks in England.  Expert Dr Andrew Turner said the levels were "completely avoidable".  Lead is listed among the top 10 "chemicals of major public health concern", by the World Health Organization (WHO).  European rules drawn up in 1977 suggest paint for playgrounds should contain no more than 0.25% lead.  But in one park in Plymouth, which was built in 2009, playground equipment recorded a 10% presence of the chemical element.  Dr Turner said the general consensus in the US and many European countries today was for paint to have a lead level of around 0.009% - which means that particular Plymouth park's recording was more than 1,000 times above agreed levels.  "You'd expect the older playgrounds to be more dangerous as people have become more aware of the dangers of lead, but our findings suggest that this isn't the case," Dr Turner told the BBC News website.  The presence of lead is more of a danger to children than adults, as their bodies are still developing.  The accumulative effects of ingesting lead can cause neurological and cognitive problems.  Dr Turner's study looked at play parks across Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire and Somerset, but he said he expected his findings to be the same all over the UK.  The presence of other chemicals such as cadmium - also listed in WHO's top 10 chemicals of concern - were also found in playground paint.  He said his message to parents was "be vigilant", and make sure their children wash their hands after playing on equipment.  "Some children tend to experience the world through putting things in their mouth so parents have to be on the lookout for that too," he said.  He also said stricter controls should be applied to domestic and imported paints used for playgrounds - and for equipment that is pre-painted before installation.  The highest concentrations of lead generally occurred in yellow or red paints, the study found.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35395464	Call to admit refugee children 'considered' by government	The government is looking at calls to take in thousands of unaccompanied refugee children who have made it into Europe, a Cabinet minister says.  Charities have been calling on the UK to admit 3,000 child refugees as part of its response to the migrant crisis.  International Development Secretary Justine Greening said ministers were considering "whether we can do more" for unaccompanied children.  Downing Street sources say no decision has been made yet.  Speaking on Sky News, Ms Greening said children "have always been at the heart of our response".  Asked about the calls for the government to consider admitting 3,000, she said: "That's what we are doing and I think that is the right thing."  Last year it was estimated that around 26,000 children arrived in Europe without their families.  Many simply disappear after they arrive and are at risk of falling prey to people-traffickers, drug dealers and other abusers, the Save the Children said.  Calls for the UK to take in 3,000 unaccompanied children would be in addition to the 20,000 refugees the UK has already pledged to take direct from refugee camps over the next five years.  Ms Greening's comments come after David Cameron told the Commons earlier in January that he was considering the issue "in good faith".  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron - who has been pushing the PM for Britain to take in unaccompanied children - told the BBC "there may be some signs" from Mr Cameron's responses in recent months that his view was "moving in that direction".  But BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says the prime minister has apparently not yet made up his mind whether to take more refugees.  He knows he could be on the brink of a referendum campaign where immigration is a major issue, our correspondent says.  Some are warning of the risks of taking in more lone children, suggesting this could lead to subsequent demands for their relatives to be brought to Britain.  But Labour's leadership is urging Mr Cameron to do more.  They say if he helps his European partners tackle the migration crisis they could then give him a better deal on Europe to take to the British people, our correspondent adds.  Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, said it was "good news that the government seems to be responding" to calls to help unaccompanied refugee children.  "But we are hearing some concern that the government may only be planning to help children within camps near Syria, and excluding those alone in Europe," she added.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made similar calls on Saturday on a trip to see refugees in Dunkirk.  Alasdair Roxburgh from charity Save the Children told BBC Radio 5live: "We'd need to make sure they were protected and safe but we would be looking at foster families or other appropriate care. The UK is very capable of doing this."  Kent County Council has already warned it will not be able to accept any more unaccompanied children, saying its children's services are facing "enormous pressure" and have run out of foster beds.	politics

Frank Field said Jeremy Corbyn was in touch on "economic injustices" but warned of an electoral "walloping" over security and migration.  Mr Corbyn is against Britain's nuclear weapons system and has called on the UK to accept more refugees.  Meanwhile, a former Labour pollster has criticised the party's report into why it lost the election.  Deborah Mattinson told the BBC's Sunday Politics her research had not been included in the review, led by Dame Margaret Beckett, and branded it a "whitewash and a massive missed opportunity".  Labour said the Beckett report had "consulted far and wide", taking input from pollsters, pundits and academics.  In a Sunday Telegraph article, they call for an end to the UK's "open-door policy", warning of a risk to social cohesion unless immigration is reduced.  He told Sky News: "On the big issues, sadly, which will decide the next election, which is about defending our borders and defending us as a nation, the Labour opposition looks as if it is walking in the opposite direction.  "Clearly that is going to have to be sorted out before the next election if we are not to get a walloping yet again."  Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Michael Dugher, who was sacked as shadow culture secretary in Mr Corbyn's reshuffle, said the Labour leader "faces a big test" in the May elections.  Mr Dugher said Mr Corbyn had to be given a chance because of his "huge mandate from party members", but said he had to show he could convert this into support from the public, including Conservative voters.  Speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live, former front-bencher Chuka Umunna said May's elections would be "essential" but said Mr Corbyn was "elected by our members and he deserves a chance to show he can do it".  He also said it was "unfair" to call the report into Labour's election defeat a whitewash.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35372495	Doctors on the move: Getting healthcare to far-flung places	Many people can find a doctor close to where they live, but for millions living in rural communities health care is many miles away. To tackle this organizations have found innovative ways of getting hospitals on the move, taking them right to the doorsteps of those in need.  Around 700 rivers are constantly shaping Bangladesh's landscape - building up some areas, flooding others, and moving small sand islands that people call home.  Along these rivers and the low lying coastal regions it often isn't possible to build permanent hospitals.  One charity has turned to these rivers to solve the problem they create.  "The rivers go into the most remote, the poorest, the most unaddressed communities which the roads do not go to," explains Runa Kahn, executive director for the charity Friendship.  "Rivers [are] the best tools by which we can carry our care to the people. Hence, hospital ships."  One of Friendship's floating hospitals brings health care to remote areas of southern Bangladesh.  The ship is a former Greenpeace boat - the Rainbow Warrior II - that has been converted into a hospital to serve the vulnerable coastal region.  It is fully equipped to provide these communities with simple treatments and medicines as well as eye, dental and other surgeries.  Abu Taher is one of the people these hospitals help. He has long-term problems with cataracts.  "I can see only with one eye. I can't walk properly and can't read anything. I can't even go to mosque to offer prayers," he explained.  The ship will allow him to receive free treatment he would not otherwise get.  "There is a government hospital in my village, but they don't offer any eye treatment," he said.  Along with two other ships in northern Bangladesh, this hospital ship helps roughly 155,000 people each year.  Using existing transport options to get hospitals on the move has proved a successful way of meeting the shortfall in health care in rural areas.  One charity has teamed up with the Indian government and railways to convert trains into roving hospitals that use over 75,000 km of India's railways to reach people in the remotest corners of the country.  Like the hospital ships in Bangladesh, the Lifeline Express trains contain, among other facilities, operations rooms, dental and eye units, laboratories and X-ray rooms.  The trains tour the country offering free treatment and cutting edge surgery to India's rural poor. They have provided procedures ranging from cleft lip operations to ear, nose and throat surgeries to millions of people over the 25 years they have been operating.  Their success has been mirrored in other hospital trains in China and in South Africa.  Projects like the Lifeline Express now include teaching facilities, allowing skills and knowledge to be passed on to local doctors and nurses.  But extensive transport infrastructure doesn't exist in every country, so finding new ways to get to rural health care providers is vital.  Orbis, a blindness prevention charity has developed a unique way of reaching remote areas - converting an aeroplane into a fully equipped ophthalmologic teaching hospital.  "We knew that doctors and nurses within developing countries had limited access to professional development and it was extremely expensive to bring them overseas for training opportunities with tuition, travel and accommodation costs high," explains Allan Thompson from Orbis.  "As a result we created our Flying Eye Hospital to take the training to them."  Bespoke modifications inside the plane means that it now houses facilities including classrooms, operating theatres and laser rooms.  Here, local doctors and surgeons can watch live surgeries and be taught new techniques and skills by staff and volunteer doctors.  "The plane has helped to conduct training in all areas of ophthalmology, from cataract, to glaucoma, to oculoplastic, to laser services across 92 countries," Mr Thompson said.  These services change the life of people in rural communities - allowing them to work and live more easily.  Back in Bangladesh, Mr Taher is recovering from his cataract surgery on the floating hospital.  "I'm feeling good after cataract surgery," he says. "It was a smooth operation.  "Now I think I'd be able to regain my vision. I feel like I've got a second life. This hospital came to us as a blessing."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35384506	Employment and Support Allowance should not be cut	Disability groups have written an open letter to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, urging him to abandon planned cuts to a key benefit.  The House of Lords will vote next week on government plans to cut £30 a week from Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for some new claimants from 2017.  The letter says it will make it harder for disabled people to find work.  But the Department for Work and Pensions says the campaigners are "scare-mongering".  "[The letter] fails to acknowledge that existing claimants and those with the most severe disabilities will not be affected at all," a spokesman said.  From April 2017, ministers are intending to reduce the amount of money people in one category of ESA receive, taking approximately £30 a week from new claimants who are deemed to be capable of making some effort to find work.  The change will bring the benefit rate in line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  More than 30 charities and members of the Disability Benefits Consortium, including Mencap, Mind and Parkinson's UK, and three peers, including Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the record-breaking Paralympian, signed the open letter to Mr Duncan Smith.  The letter said the change would "push sick and disabled people further away from work and closer to poverty".  "The government says this £30 disincentivises sick and disabled people from finding work, but it has so far offered no evidence for this claim," the letter said.  Ministers have struggled to control the cost of Employment and Support Allowance.  An analysis produced last summer by the Office for Budget Responsibility saw them once more increasing the forecast costs for ESA.  The official reason is that more people than expected are on the benefit, a consequence of an increasing number of people successfully appealing against a decision to deny them the benefit, and problems in processing fit-for-work tests that decide if claimants are eligible.  However, internal DWP documents I've seen previously suggest there is a belief in government that people are applying for ESA rather than Jobseeker's Allowance.  They get more money on ESA and the demands to apply for jobs aren't as great.  The planned reforms, for some new claimants in 2017, will bring the ESA benefit rate in line with Jobseeker's Allowance and provide more support for people to find a job, albeit with tougher conditions if they don't comply.  Ministers hope the reforms will save money and get more people into work.  Mind policy and campaigns manager Tom Pollard said: "There is a complete lack of evidence to show that stopping, or threatening to stop, someone's financial support is an effective approach.  "In fact, pressurising people with mental health problems to engage in activities under the threat of losing their benefit is counter-productive, causing additional anxiety, often making people more unwell and less able to work."  Jan Tregelles, Mencap's chief executive, said disabled people were telling the charity "loud and clear" that the cut to ESA "will make their lives harder, with both their health and chances of returning to work being harmed".  A DWP spokesman said the government was "committed to ensuring that people have the best support possible".  "The current system needs reform because it fails to provide the right incentives, and acts to trap people on welfare," the spokesman said.  "The truth is that ESA sanctions are falling, and are only used as a last resort for the tiny percentage of people who don't take up the help on offer - fewer than 1% in any given month."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35384041	Labour to be investigated over late 'Ed Stone' receipts	The Labour Party is to be investigated for being late in submitting receipts for its widely-mocked "Ed Stone".  The Electoral Commission confirmed it has now received two invoices for the monument, which listed the party's election pledges, totalling £7,830.  They include £1,575 haulage costs, and £270 for a stone mason to erect it.  Labour blamed an "admin error" for failing to submit the invoices before data of 2015 election spending by all the parties was revealed this week.  Much of the subsequent reporting of the various parties' election campaign spending highlighted that the "Ed Stone costs" had not been revealed. Labour said there had been an "administrative error" and that it would be quickly rectified.  The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate the late submission.  The maximum sanction the Electoral Commission is able to impose for a breach of the rules is £20,000.  Ed Miliband unveiled the 8ft stone carving on the final weekend of the 2015 General Election campaign, saying that it would be installed in the garden of Downing Street to remind the party of its duty to honour its six main election promises.  The move was met with near universal derision and what happened to what became known as the "Ed Stone" has been unclear. Various unconfirmed reports have suggested it is in a warehouse in London or has been destroyed.  The Electoral Commission told the BBC that it would be looking into the issue of the receipts being submitted late "in line with its policy".  It was unable to confirm how long the investigation might take, saying sometimes it has to go back and ask for more information, and each incident is dealt with on a case by case basis.  Spending on the stone was not included in the Electoral Commission data released on Wednesday.  Labour said at the time: "Due to an administrative error these invoices were not included with other items of campaign spend. We have informed the Electoral Commission and will seek to rectify this error as soon as possible."  Labour spent £12m on the campaign, the watchdog's figures show, compared with £15.5m spent by the Conservatives.  In total, £39m was spent by the UK's six largest parties on the campaign, an increase on the £34.4m spent in 2010 but lower than the record £42m spent in 2005.  Although comfortably outspending Labour over the regulated period - between 23 May 2014 and 7 May 2015 - the Conservatives spent less than in 2010, when their budget was £16.6m. In contrast, Labour spent more than in 2010, when their total outlay was £8m.  A breakdown of the figures show the Conservatives spent 27.7% of their budget on "unsolicited material", such as flyers, and 23.2% on advertising while Labour spent 61% of their budget on "unsolicited material" and 7.6% on advertising.  Spending on rallies accounted for 13% of Labour's total expenditure compared with the Conservatives' 5% while the Conservatives spent 30.1% of their budget on market research and canvassing, against Labour's 7.7% outlay.  The Conservatives spent £1.2m on advertising on Facebook in the year before the poll while Labour spent just over £16,000.  The figures do not cover some administrative spending, for instance on staff, while spending by individual candidates is reported separately.  The SNP reported the biggest rise in spending compared with 2010, when their expenditure totalled £316,000. In contrast, the Lib Dems' spending fell from £4.7m in 2010 to £3.5m last year.  The UK Independence Party spent £2.8m while the Greens spent £1.1m. UKIP spent the least per vote gained while the SNP spent least per MP won.	politics

He's suited, short back and sides, polite, and incredibly enthusiastic about his constituency. He tells me that whenever he walks into the House of Commons he reminds himself that he's there to speak up for his constituents.  "I'm a doer I like to get things done and there's so much to do," he says.  He wasn't widely known beyond Westminster until he shot to fame after last May's general election.  Labour lost; Ed Miliband resigned; and he found himself the hot favourite to win a leadership contest. Over a couple of days he was pursued by "Dan fans" and dogged by reporters and film crews as he considered whether or not he should stand.  Listen to Becky's interview with Dan Jarvis on BBC Radio 4's PM at 17:00 GMT  Why you? I ask him. To his credit he doesn't take offence.  "I don't know. I mean there had been a bit of gossip and speculation before the election… some people were quite forceful in the way that they suggested I put myself forward."  But in the end he decided against standing, saying "it wasn't the right thing for my family at that moment".  His two eldest children lost their mother, his first wife Caroline, to cancer in 2010.  He tells me: "These are just the most unspeakable, appalling times when you have young kids you don't have the luxury of going into yourself, because you've got to keep the show on the road.  "For myself, if I'm being sort of brutally honest about it, I think that I'm probably at my best when my back is against the wall, when you kind of suffer a bereavement you suffer that kind of tragedy, there's a huge pressure that comes from it, and you can either sink or you can swim… and I decided to start swimming."  He left the army - he was a major in the Parachute Regiment - and stood for Labour in the Barnsley Central by-election, and won.  He has revisited his decision not to go for the Labour leadership in a recent interview for the Guardian newspaper.  "I'm not a great one for regretting anything, but what I do regret is that I didn't give it more thought beforehand," he says.  More recently, speculation revved up again about his leadership ambitions and he was accused of being disloyal.  He rejected the criticism, telling me that he has never and will never criticise Jeremy Corbyn.  "It's not my style", he says.  I ask him about his leadership ambitions. "I don't lie awake at night thinking about it, I think what I've come to know is you never know what's around the corner, and you have to be ready for anything.  "My focus is getting on with job as the MP for Barnsley Central."  He adds: "If people say you bottled it, it doesn't affect you. Well it doesn't affect me, because it's just nonsense."  We order our lunch, he has a full English Breakfast, he won't need to eat again today, I say.  He grins. "I probably will though".  He's wary of talking about his military career, he doesn't want it to define him and worries he might be accused of showing off.  He served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan and lodged in his skull is a small fragment of shrapnel.  Rather than the military adventures - which I am fascinated by - what he wants to talk about is his vision for the Labour Party and how they can win the next election.  He says the party has a mountain to climb, but he's optimistic. It comes down to two very simple things, he says: "You've got to have credible people and credible policies and ideas."  I ask if Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell are the credible people he is talking about.  "In the end it doesn't matter what I think, because it's for the public to decide."  So, does he believe the public thinks they are credible?  "Look, I think that Jeremy is a really decent guy, many of the things that Jeremy talks about resonate with millions of people, the challenge for him and for all is, basically, now, to take it out to the country, because our membership is incredibly important.  "But it represents just a slither of the population and in the end we've got to convince the public that we are credible - and if we don't we will lose again."  I order us more tea and I ask Dan straight: Is Jeremy Corbyn a future prime minister?  "I hope so," he says.  We have a chat about his near death experience on Snowden, being stranded in remote Nepal, with his military mate David, who is now an international male model, and how he refused to hand over his wallet to a mugger.  He glances at his watch and can't believe the time: "My office will be fainting because they've lost track of me for about three weeks."  His best mate Dave, living the high life as an international male model. Fast cars, fancy do's.  Does he ever think he pulled the short straw? Oh no, he is the lucky one, he answers, the one who is privileged and honoured.  When he falls silent, I tell him I think it sounds quite exciting.  And after a pause - and it might be the first time he really lets down his guard - he laughs. "Yeah it does, doesn't it?"	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35381544	Week ahead	It's a week of fairly humdrum legislating for MPs and peers, but there are at least three major legislative events lurking in the background, and we might get some hints about their timing.  If the forthcoming EU summit goes according to David Cameron's plans, there may well be a vote to set the date of the EU membership referendum (three statutory instruments setting out the timing and ground rules for the campaign are expected to arrive pretty soon).  Judging by the heavy hints being dropped at the despatch box, a vote to renew the Trident nuclear submarines cannot be far away...and the biggest bill of this parliament - what promises to be a 500-clause behemoth on Investigatory Powers - is also coming soon. A joint committee of MPs and peers under Labour former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Murphy is due to report on a draft version of the bill soon, and Theresa May is expected to launch it at second reading early in March.  This week's crop of private members' bills could see the final demise of Lord Saatchi's attempt to create a more permissive climate for innovative medical treatments, which has surfaced in both Houses in various incarnations in recent years. And watch out for Lord Wills' Hillsborough-inspired Public Advocate Bill - which launches an important idea for the handling of future inquiries into major disasters.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons meets at 2.30pm for Education questions - and there will be an extra member of the Labour team facing the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan. In her new, cross-cutting role as shadow cabinet minister for mental health, Luciana Berger will be there to put a question from the frontbench. And the following week she will pop up at Work and Pensions questions to quiz Iain Duncan Smith. This is a minor Commons innovation - I can't think of a previous instance of a floating shadow minister….  As usual, there's a good chance that post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will follow.  Then MPs will turn to the detailed report stage consideration of the Childcare Bill - the bill to increase in the entitlement to free childcare from 15 to 30 hours a week (for 38 weeks of the year) for working parents of three and four-year-old children in England. There are several amendments requiring regular reports on child health and other issues. Labour backbencher Jess Phillips wants to add a requirement that victims of domestic violence, who have left paid employment to escape it, should continue to be eligible for 30 hours of free childcare per week.  In Westminster Hall, the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on an e-petition calling for the government to "scrap plans forcing self-employed and small business to do four tax returns".  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) the main event is the first day of report stage debate on the Welfare Reform and Work Bill - where much of the debate may focus on reporting measures. My eye was caught by an amendment from disability campaigners Baroness Campbell of Surbiton and Lord Low of Dalston requiring an annual report to Parliament on progress towards halving the disability employment gap, and by the amendment from the Bishop of Durham, Labour's Baroness Sherlock and the Crossbencher Lord Listowel, requiring an annual report on child poverty. The Crossbencher Lord Ramsbotham has another on maternal nutrition and poverty - and one of more of these amendments could be pushed to a vote. Issue on life chances, the benefit cap and benefit freeze will also be debated.  And there is also likely to be a vote on a Regret Motion from Labour's Lord Stevenson on the Education (Student support) Regulations - which Labour had tried to strike down in the Commons.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Justice questions, to be followed by a ten minute rule bill on Profit-sharing and Company Governance (Employees Participation) from Labour's Gareth Thomas.  MPs will then polish off the Legislation Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill, which provides stronger protection for charities in England and Wales from people who are unfit to be charity trustees; equips the Charity Commission with new or strengthened powers to tackle abuse of and gives charities a new power to make social investments.  In Westminster Hall, the debates are on the potential role of UK manufacturing in development of onshore oil and gas (9.30am- 11am); child poverty (11am -11.30am); further education colleges in the North East (2.30pm-4pm): Congolese refugee camps in East Africa (4pm-4.30 pm) and the funding of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (4.30pm-5.30pm).  In the Lords (from 2.30 pm) the first business is the introduction of the Lord Bishop of Newcastle, Christine Hardman, who will be the second female bishop to enter the Lords under the terms of the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015. The first female bishop was introduced in October - Rachel Treweek of Gloucester - to spontaneous applause in the chamber.  After the usual half hour of questions, peers will deal with Commons amendments to the Psychoactive Substances Bill - no votes are expected because the government have conceded on the issue on which they were defeated at report stage: making supplying legal highs in prison an aggravated offence.  The day's major event will be second reading of the Housing and Planning Bill, where the sky will be dark with markers going down for cross-party attempts to amend the bill later in its consideration. Key figures may be Crossbenchers Lord Best (a former Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation) and Lord Kerslake (the former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government). The big issues in the bill include starter homes, self-built homes, rogue landlords, abandoned premises, right to buy from housing associations, high value housing association property, high income social tenants, neighbourhood and local planning, registers of land, planning permission, nationally significant development projects and compulsory purchase.  The Commons opens at 11.30 am with half an hour of Cabinet Office questions, followed at noon Prime Minister's Question Time.  The main debate is on a Labour motion on the threat to specialist accommodation for the most vulnerable from housing benefit cuts contained in the small-print of the Chancellor's autumn statement.  Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey and the shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith are seeking to put pressure on the government over what they describe as a "catastrophic" cuts and they're calling for the Chancellor, George Osborne, to abandon them, publish a full impact assessment and consult with housing providers.  In Westminster Hall the subjects for debate are changes to funding of support for disabled people (9.30pm - 11am); cash retentions in business transactions (11am - 11.30am); resettlement of Syrian refugees (2.30pm - 4pm); late payments to small businesses (4pm - 4.30 pm) and finally, and Richard Benyon's debate (4.30pm - 5.30pm) on the Iraq Historic Allegations Team.  In the Lords (from 3pm) it's the report stage of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, where the main issues in play are exemptions from the two child limit, ESA, workplace conditionality, Universal Credit, Housing Benefit, and possibly support for mortgage interest and social housing rents exemption.  Watch out for the one-hour mini debate on the House of Lords Press Office. Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts will suggest that the House needs to set up a rapid rebuttal unit to combat inaccurate stories about it (the recent coverage of the Lord Speaker's expenses and last year's story that peers wanted their catering service to provide better champagne that was on offer in the Commons, are two examples pointed at).  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business statement from the Leader of the House.  The day's main debate, chosen by the Backbench Business Committee is another interesting backbench excursion into high-level health policy, following on from the previous week's on child obesity. This time a trio of health policy heavyweights, former coalition ministers Norman Lamb (Lib Dem) and Dan Poulter (Conservative), together with Labour's Liz Kendall, will push for a commission on the NHS and social care, to examine ways of tearing down the institutional walls between two services which need to work closely together. Mr Lamb produced a Ten Minute Rule Bill on this issue, and was startled at the warmth of his reception.  In the Lords (from 11am), the main debates are on subjects chosen by backbench Lib Dem peers. First is local democracy in the United Kingdom, led by Lord Shipley, one of the legion of senior Lib Dem councillors now in the Lords.  Then Baroness Uddin (now a non-affiliated peer) leads a debate on the topical subject of promoting English language classes for women to address isolation and extremism - and the Lib Dem Baroness Sharp of Guildford raises the role of adult education and lifelong learning in developing the skills needed to strengthen the United Kingdom economy.  Peers will also be asked to approve two Church of England measures. First, the Safeguarding and Clergy Discipline Measure, which strengthens the powers of bishops and others to suspend and discipline people holding positions in the church on safeguarding grounds - the Church believes it needs to improve its arrangements to prevent the abuse of children and vulnerable adults within the church community, and to deal effectively with those in authority them.  There's also the Diocesan Stipends Funds (Amendment) Measure - which makes some technical changes to the investment rules for Church funds. The verdict of Parliament's Ecclesiastical Committee, which considered both measures expedient recently, can be found here.  Its private members' bill day in both Houses - the Commons kicks off (9.30am) with the report stage of Chris Heaton-Harris's Access to Medical Treatments (Innovation) Bill.  This aims to create a database of innovative medical treatments, to help NHS practitioners see what has been tried and what has worked. But it also included the "Saatchi Bill" proposals to protect doctors from negligence claims if they tried innovative treatments for serious illnesses - critics called this the "quacks' charter").  It looks as if the Saatchi Bill element will be dropped, but there will also be an important addition in the shape of amendments to facilitate the licensing of off-patent drugs to treat illnesses other than the one they were originally licenced for. New uses are often found for well-established drugs, but if their patent has expired, it's often not worth the manufacturer going through an expensive licensing process - a Labour MP Nick Thomas Symonds saw his bill to create a new licensing mechanism for this purpose talked out in the Commons in November.  But that raised such a stink that ministers now seem keen to revisit the issue - so look out for some amendments to this bill, and more particularly for policy announcements that the minister is expected to give at the despatch box.  Then, if there's much time left, we are into second reading debates on an assortment of bills which are well down the list and have little priority for debate, and, this late in the Parliamentary year, have little chance of becoming law: Peter Bone's Child Victims of Human Trafficking (Central Government Responsibility) Bill reflects his years of campaigning on human trafficking issues. Labour's Kerry McCarthy has her Food Waste (Reduction) Bill, and central London MP Karen Buck has bills on Basement Excavation and Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation). I doubt we'll make it to the former minister Tim Loughton's Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill - which aims to allow heterosexual couples to formalise their relationships in civil partnerships.  Over in the Lords (from 10am) the first business is detailed consideration of Lord Empey's Airports Act 1986 (Amendment) Bill - but what really caught my eye was the Labour former Justice Minister Lord Wills' Public Advocate Bill. This has an interesting backstory. Lord Wills was the minister who devised the mechanism which allowed a new look at the evidence on the Hillsborough disaster and his bill would create a public advocate who could represent the families of people killed in a disaster, in any subsequent inquiry.  There's also the Road Traffic Act 1988 (Alcohol Limits) (Amendment) Bill from Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe and the Age of Criminal Responsibility Bill from Lord Dholakia.	politics

Early explorers called it the "scourge of the sea" and the disease was widespread during the Victorian era, but could scurvy now be making a comeback?  Parents are constantly telling children to eat their greens and health experts urge us to make sure we eat our "five a day" - and with good reason.  Fruit and vegetables are important sources of vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) which the body needs to keep our bones, skin, tissues and blood vessels healthy.  Without it, we lack a protein called collagen which can't be replaced and we end up with symptoms that were common hundreds of years ago in sick sailors and malnourished children.  The numbers are very small, but scurvy is on the rise in England, according to official figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre.  In the year up to April 2014, it was the primary diagnosis behind 16 hospital admissions and the primary or secondary cause of 94 admissions.  Between 2009 and 2014, admissions went up by 27%.  That's in line with percentage increases in hospital admissions for malnutrition and gout - a common Victorian complaint traditionally associated with too much port and an unhealthy lifestyle - over the same period.  The most recent research, conducted in 2014, suggests that gout currently affects one in 40 people in the UK.  One of those unfortunates, the BBC's Richard Warry, explained his shock at being diagnosed with an extremely painful condition which is no laughing matter.  What does this say about the nation's diet?  During the 18th century, it was dire - especially for sailors on long-distance voyages on the high seas. At that time, scurvy killed more British sailors than enemy action.  In the 1740s, a British voyage to the Pacific lost 1,300 men out of a 2,000-strong crew within 10 months of leaving port.  Richard Walter, the chaplain on the voyage, described the terrible suffering of the men, noting their ulcers, blackened skin, revolting gum disease and rotting breath.  When they got hold of the fruit they craved so badly, he described them swallowing it "with emotions of the most voluptuous luxury".  They had been used to eating a predominately salty diet, overdosing on seals' livers and fat.  They were, literally, dying for vitamin C.  When they reached land, it was celery, cabbage and plants which helped them recover. Future voyages carried dried vegetables, fruit and palm wine and sauerkraut to help ward off the dreaded scurvy and in 1752 a Scottish doctor, James Lind, found proof that citrus had a rapid beneficial effect.  Today, we are in a far better position thanks to improvements in standard of living and diet - but that doesn't mean there aren't pockets of people still at risk.  Lucy Jackman, a paediatric dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says low-income families and those dependent on drugs or alcohol tend to the ones most often in that bracket.  "Scurvy results from a prolonged deficiency of vitamin C, which we get entirely from our diet, and it can make people really ill."  Warning signs of scurvy can include tiredness, muscle and joint pain and bleeding or swelling of the gums.  She says cases of scurvy are rare and isolated, but she does see very small numbers of children with vitamin C deficiency, which is generally related to "very fussy eating".  "The key is to catch it early, get the message across about balanced eating and to make sure they are eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day."  Eating healthily doesn't have to be expensive, she says.  "Vitamins can come from a variety of sources. Although fresh fruit and vegetables are ideal, they can also be tinned or frozen, as long as they are varied."  Eating one large orange, a bowl of strawberries or a single kiwi fruit is enough to provide you with the vitamin C needed for your body every day.  While the increasing prevalence of gout in the UK is a concern, experts put it down to an ageing population and a growing obesity problem.  This painful and severe form of arthritis, which is caused by a build-up of uric acid in the body, can be managed through changes in lifestyle, like losing weight, eating less red meat and reducing alcohol intake.  Thanks to the childhood vaccination programme, many serious infectious diseases are a thing of the past.  But some common Victorian diseases still make an appearance on official hospital admission statistics, including cholera, typhoid fever, scarlet fever and rickets.  The cases may be rare, affecting the very young or the very old, but their presence reminds us that although time has moved on, poor diet can still be a cause of some serious illnesses.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35374588	Diabetes: Government and NHS too slow to act, say MPs	MPs have criticised the Department of Health and the NHS in England for being "too slow" to act in preventing and treating diabetes.  A report by the Public Accounts Committee says variations in the care of both type 1 and 2 diabetes mean the annual cost to the health service will continue to rise.  For people aged 16 and over the bill currently stands at £5.5bn a year.  An NHS England spokesman said "diabetes care [was] better than ever".  But he also said the obesity-fuelled jump in type 2 diabetes threatened to "overwhelm GP services".  "...[It] puts the spotlight firmly on the need for no-holds-barred national action on prevention by the NHS, government, employers, schools, and in particular the food industry," he added.  The committee said the number of adults in England with diabetes has risen to more than 3 million, and was going up by almost 5% every year.  The government and NHS England had portrayed an "unduly healthy picture" of the state of diabetes services, it added.  Most of the £5.5bn-a-year cost is spent on complications from diabetes, such as heart and kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage, leading to amputations.  These can be minimised by catching the disease early, and managing blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol.  But the committee said that part of the problem was there were "unacceptable variations" in education, care and treatment of patients.  Moreover, only 60% of patients receive the annual checks recommended to keep them healthy and prevent long-term complications.  The report also said diabetes specialist staffing levels in hospitals "are not keeping pace" with the increasing percentage of beds occupied by diabetes patients.  It said: "The percentage of beds in acute hospitals in England occupied by people with diabetes continues to rise, from 14.8% in 2010 to 15.7% in 2013.  "However, the level of diabetic specialists has not significantly changed over this period. In 2013, nearly one-third of hospitals in England taking part in the audit had no diabetes inpatient specialist nurse and 6% did not have any consultant time for diabetes inpatient care.  "NHS England told us that an increase in nursing numbers isn't likely in the next year or two."  Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the committee, said: "The NHS and Department for Health have been too slow in tackling diabetes, both in prevention and treatment.  "The number of people with diabetes is increasing, as is the number of patients who develop complications. It is a very serious condition that can have a huge impact on people's lives."  She said taxpayers must have confidence that support is available when and where they need it, "rather than by virtue of where they live".  The government has introduced a new NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme to try to limit the number of people developing type 2 diabetes. The programme will encourage people to lose weight and exercise.  Being overweight is the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and 90% of adults with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.  But the committee said "by itself, this [the programme] will not be enough to stem the rising number of people with diabetes".  A Department of Health spokesman said "big improvements in diabetes care" had been made, but added: "Any variation in care, as this report highlights, is deeply concerning.  "That's why we are creating a national diabetes prevention programme, the first of its kind in the world, so that we help people avoid developing this devastating condition in the first place."	health

Language was spelled "langauge" in the original release, put out on Thursday.  But it was corrected by officials after Twitter users ridiculed the error.  BBC Radio 4 presenter Anita Anand said it was "beyond parody" that the Home Office could not spell language in a note to migrants who have been told to learn English.  The Home Office has been contacted for a response.  On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a £20m fund to teach Muslim women in the UK to speak English, claiming it would help tackle segregation and help them resist the lure of extremism.  But some Muslims have accused him of wrongly conflating the two issues.  Mr Cameron said all those who entered the UK on the five-year spousal settlement programme - not just Muslim women - would have to sit language tests after two and a half years.  Thursday's press release said the new requirement would not be implemented before October 2016, with the precise timing and further details to be confirmed by the Home Office "in the next few weeks".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35377323	How a bare-knuckle battle could play out	The government's latest defeat in the House of Lords could put the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, under some pressure to save key elements of the Trade Union Bill.  Wednesday's vote was on an innocuous-looking motion to set up a special select committee to examine the sections of the bill dealing with political funding by unions and report by the end of February.  This not only tees up the possibility of some unwelcome (to the government) amendments, perhaps directly suggested by that committee, perhaps inspired by its report. It also means ministers will be negotiating against the clock, if they try to strike them down.  Take a look at the timetable for the bill. It is due to have four days of committee stage consideration, starting on 8 February - and it won't end until 24 February at the earliest, even assuming no go-slows or cunning filibustering tactics.  Given the way the Lords phases its debates, this, in turn, means that the crucial report stage, - probably requiring two full days - can't finish before 14 March. This is the point at which serious amendments will be put to the bill, and after that, the third reading is held a week later.  Going by the voting on Wednesday, when the government was defeated by 327-234 votes - a stonking 93-vote majority - ministers can expect to suffer a number of defeats on a variety of issues, where Labour and the Lib Dems can mobilise their peers to vote through amendments.  Party funding is just one of the potential flashpoints: there may also be amendments on key sections dealing with strike ballots and the collection of union membership subscriptions. That means there's some serious parliamentary ping-pong in prospect.  Ping-pong is the process where the Commons has to consider the changes the Lords have made to the bill and either accepts or rejects them; if the Lords amendments are rejected the bill has to be sent back to Peers, and if they then have to decide to bow to the will of the elected House, or suggest further amendments, usually watering down their original amendments a bit.  It can go on for quite some time.  And by then the clock will be ticking towards the end of the parliamentary session late in May, and the dreaded legislative "washup". This is process by which all outstanding legislation is agreed - and it is the moment when the Lords enjoys its maximum power because if it has not agreed to a bill when the music stops and the Parliamentary Session ends, that bill is lost.  Faced with that prospect ministers usually strike deals. But even factoring in the Easter holidays, they may not feel they are in immediate danger. There should be several weeks for any changes their Lordships make to the Trade Union Bill to bounce between Lords and Commons. And, if necessary, ping-pong can happen immediately and intensively, as soon as Peers have given the bill its third reading.  Of course, the government's parliamentary business managers have plenty of cards to play. They could for example keep both Houses sitting through the night, or even through several nights, to get their way.  In Wednesday's vote, the crucial Crossbench vote was more or less evenly divided (remember the Crossbenchers don't have a party line, still less a whip) with 38 voting with the government and 44 against. But key figures like Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has warned against changes to party funding rules that only affect one main party, not the other, and the former mandarin, Lord Kerslake, have emerged as important players who could swing the debate.  I'm told the special select committee's already lining up key witnesses - and its report could be crucial in those report stage votes on the party funding clauses of the bill. But look out, also, for a big push to allow electronic voting in union ballots. I suspect this may be one of the few areas where the government might offer a concession.  The bottom line is that for Labour the loss of millions of pounds of political funding as a result of the changes proposed in this bill could destroy its ability to compete with the Conservative Party; so whatever the rights and wrongs of opting into, rather than out of, a political levy, this will be a bare-knuckle battle for very high stakes.  Even with its current woes, the Labour Party can unite against what it perceives as a tribal attack, so the Labour peers may not go gently into that good night.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35370234	Labour's McDonnell considers giving workers right to buy firms	A Labour government could give employees the right to take over their companies if they are sold, dissolved or floated on the stock market.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the party does not want to return to an era of widespread state ownership.  Instead, Labour would look to expand co-operatives and explore giving workers the "right to own".  David Cameron has accused Labour of wanting to turn back the clock to the days of state ownership and strikes.  But Mr McDonnell tackled this claim head-on in a speech in Manchester, saying Labour had to move on from its traditional belief that state ownership was always the answer.  "Whatever the achievements of the past, we cannot simply turn the clock back - whether to 1997, 1964, or 1945," he said.  At the last election, "the Tories talked relentlessly, overwhelmingly about the future. Labour, strikingly, did not".  "We cannot allow that to happen again. We cannot be small 'c' conservatives."  He added: "A future Labour government will end the current programme of spending cuts. We will protect what has already been won.  "But we must look beyond this point. We should be seizing the opportunity to create a fairer, more democratic society."  Labour has already announced its intention to return the railways to public ownership.  But when it comes to the wider economy, Mr McDonnell said Labour should "look elsewhere" for solutions, and draw on its tradition of supporting workers' co-operatives.  He signalled support for giving employees in companies which are about to be sold off - or floated on the stock exchange - the first option to purchase the company.  "The Tories have offered a Right to Buy, Labour would seek to better this. We'd be creating a new Right to Own," he said in a speech in Manchester.  He said the "biggest hurdle" facing co-ops and other small businesses was getting initial funding from high street banks.  "No other major developed economy has just five banks providing 80% of loans. We'd look to break up these monopolies, introducing real competition and choice.  "Regional and local banks, prudently run and with a public service mandate, have to be part of the solution here."  Mr McDonnell is also considering adopting the Italian government's policy of offering funding to help employee-owned enterprises to get off the ground.  "With consortium co-operatives providing an effective means for new businesses to share and reduce costs, we'd look to support these at a local level, working with local authorities, businesses and trade unions," he said.  He said the policy would be developed "over the next few years", adding: "In an uncertain world where a laissez faire market approach continues to fail, co-operation is an idea whose time has come again.  "This is the start of developing a new, positive economic alternative for Labour."  He also urged Labour to embrace opportunities offered by the internet and new technology.  "Technology is proving disruptive. It can have terrible downsides - de-skilling and an accelerated concentration of wealth.  "But it also opens up new possibilities - the explosion of sharing that the Internet can provide.  "There is an entrepreneurial spirit at work here: not the theatrical meanness and one-upmanship of Gordon Gekko, but a desire to create something better for us all."  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands said Labour represented "a threat to our economic security".  He added: "Now we know the truth: Labour is planning another debt-fuelled spending spree and a huge tax bombshell on the businesses that have helped to drive Britain's recovery from the economic mess they left behind."	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35370855	A day in the life of a hospital	Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham is the biggest single-site teaching hospital in Europe.  About 2,000 outpatients come through the doors every day, and this year it will see more than one million patients in total.  Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham can certainly reel off the statistics to demonstrate its importance to the West Midlands healthcare economy and the NHS as a whole.  My day here with the BBC Radio 5 live team during the network's 24-hour broadcast has provided a prism for looking at the challenges facing the health service.  Patient demand is an obvious one.  That expected figure of a million patients seen across the trust this year compares with 650,000 in 2010, the year the hospital opened.  That was when services at two hospitals were transferred to a single site in the newly constructed building.  The pressures on accident and emergency are all too clear.  Rising numbers coming through the doors, including some from well beyond Birmingham, have made it hard to hit national benchmarks.  The proportion treated or assessed within four hours is running at about 92%, below the 95% target but in line with the average for hospitals across England.  Emergency admissions are up 16% this month compared with January 2015.  The increase over that period for the over-65s is even steeper, at 23%.  Managing the finances has become progressively harder.  The trust recorded annual surpluses until this financial year, when it expects to make a deficit in the order of £23m.  Keeping a lid on spending on agency staff is a big challenge for many hospitals, but less so for Queen Elizabeth.  Management say recruitment has not been easy while acknowledging a major city teaching hospital will generally find it easier than others to attract staff.  The hospital was built under the private finance initiative, similar to a mortgage. But bosses say PFI hasn't caused financial headaches.  Queen Elizabeth Hospital is doing what it can to reduce delayed discharges.  The Harborne ward is set aside for elderly patients medically ready to return home but awaiting social-care arrangements to be put in place.  The idea is to make it feel like a nursing home rather than a conventional medical ward so occupants don't get used to being "hospitalised".  Even so, this week about 50 beds elsewhere in the hospital have been "blocked", about 3% of the total.  The trust chief executive, Dame Julie Moore, is one of the leading NHS executives in England.  She has been in the post for 10 years and oversaw the creation of the new hospital.  She believes that despite all the pressures, things are "just about under control".  But on the bigger agenda of health and social care integration, "systems should be joined up".  When it comes to weekend services, Dame Julie believes she can deliver the appropriate level of care and doctor staffing levels within the existing contract arrangements.  Much of the debate about the "seven-day NHS" has revolved around the need for doctors' contract reform.  But Dame Julie says through local agreements, the correct number of junior doctors and consultants are currently on duty at weekends.  As the hustle and bustle of daily life at this hospital continues, the chief executive makes a plea for the NHS to be talked up as a "great place to work".  Dame Julie told BBC Radio 5 live there was every reason to be positive about "one of our best national assets, which makes Britain what it is".	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35368693	David Cameron urges business to 'get out there' and campaign on EU	David Cameron has urged business leaders who want Britain to remain in a reformed EU not to "hold back".  The PM has told his cabinet colleagues to wait until he returns from Brussels with a reform deal before campaigning to leave or stay in the EU.  But he told an audience of global business leaders they should "get out there" and start making their case now.  He was speaking during a three-day visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Mr Cameron said he hoped to get agreement on his reform demands at an EU summit next month, paving the way for referendum later this year, but he was in "no hurry" if the deal was not right.  Prospects for a swift agreement were played down by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who said the negotiations had "only just begun" and warned that a deal "at any price" would not be acceptable.  Mr Cameron said his proposed welfare reforms were "absolutely crucial" to his hopes of getting a reform deal.  But he said he was open to other, "equally potent", welfare curbs if other EU nations refused to accept a four year ban on in-work benefits for new arrivals to the UK.  He said he would continue to push for reforms to the EU in the future even if Britain voted to remain in it - and stressed that he believed the UK could succeed outside the EU, but he said the question was "how will we be the most successful?"  Success in the renegotiation could deliver the UK "the best of both worlds" by allowing it to be within the single market while retaining control of its borders and remaining outside the single currency and the ever-closer union sought by some other member states.  He said it was "a prize worth fighting for" and one "I'm determined to deliver in this, my second term as prime minister" and he issued a plea to businesses and charities to get behind him.  "I would say don't hold back right now, even though the question isn't settled.  "I think that if business backs my reforms, if you want to see the competitive Europe, if you want to see the flexible Europe, if you want to see a Europe where you can be in the eurozone and win or out of the eurozone and win, I would argue 'Get out there and support those things'."  Mr Cameron explained why Britain was having a referendum - that it was "drifting away" from the EU and it had become increasingly unpopular with the British public.  He said he wanted to "secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union" and to do this by securing "full and democratic support" for membership from the public.  Meanwhile, in London, Downing Street said a cabinet meeting would be held "soon after" any deal was agreed - following concerns a delay could assist the campaign to remain in the EU.  Some ministers had raised concerns that a delay to holding a cabinet meeting would give Mr Cameron the opportunity to set out his case for the deal without being challenged.  However, Number 10 said a cabinet meeting would be held "in good order" after any agreement, but said it could not guarantee a day or time.  Liz Bilney, chief executive of Leave.EU, said: "The fact that the prime minister is begging for international corporations to stick their noses into our democratic process only shows how little he and the elite care for ordinary British citizens."  Matthew Elliot, who heads Vote Leave, suggested Mr Cameron's speech was aimed at big business but it was "the smaller businesses who are most hurt by EU regulation".  CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said: "The majority of CBI members want the UK to be in a reformed EU - changing it for the better, not just for the UK but for all member states... there are several areas where the EU needs to raise its game. Businesses want to see more trade deals, completion of the single market and less red tape."  The Institute of Directors urged businesses not to "bury their heads in the sand" over the EU referendum and had "a duty to their shareholders, employees and customers to be discussing the implications of the vote at the most senior levels".

Thousands of people were infected with Hepatitis C and HIV through NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s.  Ms Ellison said the money would come from the Department of Health's budget, and she apologised again to victims.  In March last year the Penrose report was published after a six-year inquiry.  Lord Penrose, a retired judge, concluded that more should have been done to screen blood and donors for hepatitis C in the early 1990s.  Many of those affected were in Scotland, which was the only part of the UK to hold an inquiry.  Ms Ellison said the government was now opening a 12-week consultation on the new payment proposals.  She said the £100m is in addition to the £25m which was announced in March - taking the total to £225m over the five years to 2020.  "This is significantly more than any previous government has been able to provide for those affected by this tragedy," she told MPs in the Commons.  But she also admitted that "no amount of money could make up for the impact" blood infections had on victims and families.  The contaminated blood scandal has been described as the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS, and was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people - many of whom were haemophilia patients.  In Scotland the Penrose report said that 478 people acquired the Hepatitis C virus from blood product therapy, and 2,500 acquired the virus from blood transfusion in Scotland between 1970 and 1991.  Sixty patients acquired HIV from therapy with blood products, and 18 from blood transfusion in Scotland.  The scandal happened before the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament, which now has full responsibility for the NHS in Scotland.  When the Penrose report was published last year there was an angry response from victims and relatives, some of whom labelled it a "whitewash", and burned copies of the report on the streets of Edinburgh.  Ms Ellison also said that within the consultation there was a proposal for all those currently receiving regular support to have that funding increased to £15,000 a year, and those who are co-infected - as in contaminated with more than one virus - should get £30,000.  She also said the government wanted to "focus on those who are infected" and be able to "respond to new advances in medicine".  As well as the extra cash the government is also proposing to make a single body responsible for a new support scheme with the promise of more help for certain groups of people, such as those with Hepatitis C.  "There is a large population within the infected blood community who currently do not receive any regular financial support. These are the people with Hepatitis C.  "I believe it is important that everybody receives support from the new scheme and that this is linked to the impact that infection has on their health," she said.  Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne praised the government's intentions for a consultation, but noted the "injustice felt by many victims".	health

It's the 35th anniversary this month of the Limehouse Declaration that led to the founding of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).  Back in 1981, the so-called "Gang of Four" senior Labour politicians broke off - partly in protest at the leftward drift of their party.  Could history repeat itself? Very possibly, according to two surviving members of the Gang of Four - Shirley Williams and David Owen.

There is an old blues standard with the lyric "I've been down so very damn long, this looks like up to me". By that measure, things are looking up for the Labour leader.  To the fury and frustration of many of his parliamentary colleagues, and the slack-jawed amazement of some lobby journalists, Jeremy Corbyn is still in the job after failing every test they have set him.  Perhaps, it says as much about them as about him.  Now the smoke has cleared away from the reshuffle, he has regained control over a key policy - Trident.  He was given a kind of standing ovation for a speech to a Fabian conference, which some described as his best yet.  And he survived a big interview with Andrew Marr, with only one headline mocking his naivety.  Perhaps most importantly, Len McCluskey the leader of the UK's biggest union, Unite, told me, on BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend programme, that to regard the May elections as a referendum on Mr Corbyn was ridiculous - he would be "allowed"' two or three years to prove himself.  These are all a very low bars.  Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are not quaking in their boots.  But they leave the Labour right with a huge conundrum - one insightful commentator has been musing recently on whether it should even want to do well in the coming elections.  Fanciful ideas circulate about MPs saying they have a mandate, because millions of people have voted for them, whereas Mr Corbyn and Labour members do not.  But basing a strategy around losing elections and formalising a split are more of a yardstick of desperation than practical politics.  Journalists and politicians based at Westminster see the world in a certain way, through a fairly narrow lens, and measure daily success and failure through a set of unwritten rules reached by instinct rather than reflection.  The soap opera of the Westminster village matters to those who adore the storyline.  It is often about a tug of war between positive and negative headlines, trials of strength over internal and external opponents, with all the fragility of narrative within a bubble.  One of the reason's Mr Corbyn attracts so much opprobrium from those whose orbit circles planet Westminster is he will not accept their measure of his worth.  He seems more concerned with remaking the Labour Party in his own image than winning applause from hostile crowds.  The climax of one of my favourite science-fiction novels by the late, great Iain M Banks, The Player of Games has the representative of a pan-species libertarian communist idyll of which Mr Corbyn might approve taking on a brutal, fascistic, authoritarian and warlike regime at a sort of violent hi-tech version of multi-dimensional chess.  He, unwittingly, plays their destructive game of conquest and revenge in a way that turns it into an artistic performance, a harmonious, complex ballet.  His opponents react with vast, speechless fury because he has done something much worse than beat them.  He has undermined their rules and their values.  The Jeremy Corbyn Story: Profile of Labour's new leader  Jeremy Corbyn: Who is Labour's new leader?  This is not to say Mr Corbyn is about to do the same.  But Westminster's rules are not the only measure.  There is a similar level of mutual incomprehension.  And the Labour leader, with an equal lack of guile, is subverting the game itself.  It is not that Mr Corbyn does not play by the rules, so much as he simply distains them, a debutant who turns up at the ball in torn jeans and slouches against the wall, sullenly refusing to join the dance.  New Labour's architects understood something obvious but rarely exploited until then - politicians are known to the great mass of voters only through the media.  A central part of their strategy was to seize control of the way their image and actions would be reported.  The techniques varied from wooing to bullying, circumventing the hard questions to tackling them head on.  The message merged with the medium.  Mr Corbyn appears to be the very mirror image of this.  His speeches do not contain an obvious attention-grabbing new policy, briefed in advance.  Prime Minister's Questions is not a mano-a-mano trial of strength, envisaged through the lens of the next hour's headline.  Inside the serious personnel management of a reshuffle, there is no central message.  But in this he is, possibly unwittingly, following a central insight of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair about media management - most people do not follow the details of politics, it is the broad image, a flavour, that comes across.  It could just work.  Mr Corbyn's dogged pursuit of policy and principle without fancy frills and theatrical lunges at the enemy does portray a certain earnest sincerity that clearly appeals to many potential supporters of the Labour Party.  My unscientific analysis would suggest many Corbyn enthusiasts are not the Trotskyists of MPs' imagination but people disillusioned by Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, impelled by youthful enthusiasm or nostalgic remembrance for something with less "yah" and "boo" and more principle.  For often less than good or sensible reasons, "politician" has long been an insult - people who elevate tactics and electoral victory over higher purpose.  Not being like them, may not be seen as such a bad thing.  But the problem for the Labour Party is this may be enough to keep Mr Corbyn from being seriously challenged but not enough to win any new voters.  As Margaret Beckett's report makes clear, having an electable leader and a winning economic policy are central but not the only challenges.  The loss of Scotland, the collapse of working-class loyalty, English identity, an ageing population, the ideological challenges for the centre left are, on their own, big roadblocks on the path to power.  Piled up together, it is hard to envisage the sort of bulldozer that could shift them.  Mr Corbyn may not be the man for the job - but he is the man with the job, behind the wheel.  I have always found when kings and queens forged history fascinating.  They were often very ordinary people, without formal training, thrust into exceptional roles.  How they fared says much about human nature and politics.  But this is not true of modern democracies.  Indeed, it is not true of most modern dictatorships.  Whether Stalin or Churchill, or indeed Neil Kinnock or Iain Duncan Smith, leaders have paid their dues, gained a patina of experience, during their far from inexorable and inevitable rise.  They have learnt the tricks of the trade the hard way, hard knocks filing off rough edges.  But this is not true of Mr Corbyn, who never planned to be leader, never thought he would be, and has not jostled colleagues for power and position.  The fervent republican King Jeremy the Accidental has little past history of cunning or compromise, just the guiding principle of a passionately held set of ideas.  We may need a different ruler to measure his rule - both its length and purpose.	politics

In a joint declaration, at the World Economic Forum, they said the value of antibiotics "does not reflect the benefits they bring to society".  In return, they have promised to invest in research and improve access to antibiotics around the world.  There have been repeated warnings the world is on the cusp of a "post-antibiotic era", raising the prospect of untreatable infections.  It would be a world in which surgery and cancer therapies, reliant on antibiotics, would be under threat.  Drug-resistant microbes are predicted to kill 10 million people a year by 2050 and cost $100 trillion in lost economic output.  Yet there has not been a new class of antibiotic brought to market for more than four decades.  The declaration says the current approach has "largely failed" despite the investment of billions of dollars.  It also sites the "formidable" scientific challenges that have led to many pharmaceutical companies pulling out of antibiotic research.  One of the biggest issues is money - at the moment, a company is paid only for the drugs it sells.  Yet any new antibiotic would probably be used only as a last resort, so companies would not recover the development costs.  A report by economist Jim O'Neill had suggested lump-sum payments should be given to companies that created proven new antibiotics, estimating the cost to governments would be $16-37bn over the next decade.  The declaration, from 85 companies, calls "for governments to commit funding and support the development and implementation of transformational commercial models that enhance conservation of new and existing antibiotics" as well as creating a "sustainable and predictable" market for new drugs.  AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said: "The declaration's call for collaborative action on new commercial models is timely.  "Industry is ready to engage with governments to develop alternative market structures to enable the sustainable investment that is necessary if we are to overcome the formidable technical and scientific challenges of antibiotic discovery and development."  Redx Pharma Plc chief executive Neil Murray said: "There is a doomsday clock ticking, with the effectiveness of antibiotics diminishing at an alarming rate.  "New ways must be found to support innovation and drug discovery in this critical area."  World Health Organization director general Dr Margaret Chan said: "Antimicrobial resistance is beyond the capacity of any organisation or country to manage or mitigate alone.  "WHO and its member states have called for the development of new antimicrobial medicines and affordable access to them, in line with the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance.  "This declaration affirms that the challenges of antimicrobial resistance can be addressed only through collaboration and global collective action."	health

They include three sisters who developed breast tumours within 15 months of each other.  The 100,000 Genomes Project in England will look at their DNA, and that of thousands of other patients, to help the search for precision treatments and understand how tumours develop.  Cancer Research UK said the project was "very exciting".  In November 2013, Mary Lloyd was diagnosed with breast cancer, as was her younger sister Kerry two months later. In February the following year their sister Sandra was diagnosed too.  Mary, 61 and from Northampton, told the BBC News website: "It was really unbelievable.  "I had just retired and made plans, then to find out Kerry also had breast cancer - she's got two children still at school - it was just awful.  "Sandra had almost prepared herself [for her diagnosis] and she was devastated as well.  "But because we're sisters together we've been able to support one another. That's really important as the treatment is horrendous."  Cancer is a genetic disease caused by mutations in our DNA that lead to cells dividing uncontrollably.  The sisters are taking part in the 100,000 Genomes Project, run within the NHS, which is trying to understand the mutations that cause or increase the risk of cancer.  It will also determine the drugs that can target tumours. Herceptin works only in patients with specific mutations.  "It's classed as the beginning of the end of chemotherapy," said Dr Julian Barwell, a consultant in clinical genetics at the the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.  He told the BBC: "This is the first step for the NHS into genomic medicine. If successful it will give individual tumour profiles and identify which drugs are likely to benefit you. It's hugely exciting."  Not every patient will benefit from the study, but the understanding of the mutations that lead to their cancer will help in the development of "precision therapies" targeting the weak spots in tumours.  Sir Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "We hope that, one day, treatments based on the specific characteristics of the tumour, including the genetic make-up, can be offered to all patients - and this latest phase of the 100,000 Genomes Project is another important step towards this."  The project will also aim to uncover why tumours develop. The three sisters might have been at a genetically higher risk of developing cancer.  Mary told the BBC: "We agreed to take part because we don't have the common BRCA 1 or 2 genes [which led Angelina Jolie to have her breasts removed] so it could help to find a gene that hasn't been identified yet.  "And it opens it up for the rest of our family to be tested and for everyone else out there that might be facing a similar situation."  The 100,000 Genomes Project is spilt into two halves, one looking at cancer and the other rare diseases.  This month, the first children with debilitating "mystery" rare diseases were given a diagnosis as part of the study.  They had been unable to explain why she was growing slowly, had damaged eyes and kidneys and is still unable to talk.  The 100,000 Genomes Project was able to identify the gene responsible for her condition.  Life Sciences Minister George Freeman said the start of the cancer phase was a "significant milestone in the revolutionary 100,000 Genomes Project".  He said: "It will help to unlock our understanding of the causes of this devastating condition, make the UK a leader in genetic research, and provide better diagnosis and more targeted treatment for thousands of NHS patients across the UK."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35350450	Desert island toxic algae may hint to a treatment for dementia	Scientists say they now have good evidence in animals that exposure to a toxin from algae can trigger dementia-like changes in the brain.  If the US team is right, they may have found a new route towards treating and preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's .  Their work, in the Proceedings B journal, lends weight to a scientific theory experts have been chasing for decades.  The story began in the 1950s on a small Pacific Island called Guam.  Many of the indigenous people who lived there - the Chamorros - were dying from a perplexing paralytic disease.  US Army doctors described symptoms similar to dementia, Parkinson's and motor neuron disease.  Post-mortem examinations revealed abnormal collections of proteins in the brain that can also be seen in patients with Alzheimer's.  Researchers began to look at the island environment and what the Chamorros were eating to see if there was any link.  And a hypothesis began to emerge that an environmental toxin called BMAA could be to blame.  Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine is made by bacteria found on and around the island.  Experts identified it in algae-rich pools of water and in the roots and seeds of the native cycad palm trees.  Fruit bats, known as flying foxes, a local delicacy, which feast on the cycad seeds, also harboured the toxin.  What was missing, until now, was experimental evidence that BMAA could trigger the telltale brain changes seen in the villagers.  So, Dr Paul Cox, from the Institute of Ethnomedicine, and colleagues from the University of Miami fed monkeys fruit laced with BMAA.  After 140 days, they all had abnormal proteins (tangles) in the brain.  The control monkeys, who received only regular fruit, had none of these brain changes.  Dr Cox repeated the experiment with more monkeys - 32 in total - and found the same.  "Every single one that had eaten the BMAA bananas developed the brain tangles," he said, "even the cohort given low-dose BMAA."  "If what we found in these animals holds up in man, then it means a few things.  "We need to protect people from this toxin.  "We have to get very serious about clean water supplies.  "And it may be possible to prevent some other neurodegenerative diseases."  Dr Cox has been focusing on motor neuron disease - a progressive condition that attacks the nerves.  Working with Dr Ken Rodgers and Dr Rachael Dunlop in Sydney, his team has found BMAA mimics an amino acid called L-serine and inserts itself into brain proteins, causing them to misfold and tangle.  And clinical trials are testing whether giving patients L-serine tablets might prevent this.  "We do not know if it will work, but we really hope so," Dr Cox said.  Dr Laura Phipps, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This research in animals suggests that BMAA exposure could directly lead to hallmark features of neurodegenerative disease, providing new insight into the likely cause of this condition on Guam.  "While investigating rare forms of dementia can lead to insights into the more common causes of the condition, further research is needed to understand whether the findings have relevance to diseases like Alzheimer's or motor neurone disease in other parts of the world.  "The research suggests that L-serine could reduce the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain associated with high levels of BMAA exposure.  "There are early stage clinical trials for L-serine in motor neuron disease, and similar trials would be needed to explore whether L-serine could have any benefit for typical forms of Alzheimer's, not associated with the toxin.  "There is currently no evidence to suggest that taking L-serine supplements could help improve symptoms in Alzheimer's disease."  Most cases of Alzheimer's are caused by a mix of age, genetic and lifestyle factors.  The risk can be cut by:	health

The US bank is said to have backed Britain Stronger In Europe, a cross-party group leading the In campaign.  Britain Stronger In Europe said it would not confirm the donation which Sky News said was a "substantial" sum.  It comes as David Cameron prepares to tell business to "make the case" for the staying in a "reformed EU".  In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Mr Cameron will say the "voice of business" must be heard in the run-up to the referendum on the UK's membership of EU - which will take place before the end of 2017.  "If you agree with me about the changes I am arguing for in Europe… if you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations… join me in making that case," he will say.  The exact timing of the referendum will hinge on the outcome of Mr Cameron's current renegotiation talks, due to come to a head at a summit of European leaders next month.  Goldman Sachs, which employs 6,000 people in the UK, has not commented on the donation. Although the sum being mooted is relatively small, the move would be symbolic and illustrative of the City's concerns about the implications of the UK leaving the EU.  A spokesman for Britain Stronger In Europe, which is chaired by ex-Marks & Spencer boss Lord Rose, told the BBC: "We are not going to comment on individual donations to the campaign at this stage.  "We will in time declare all our donations in line with standard electoral commission rules once we are the designated campaign. We are raising money from individuals and businesses in the UK from all walks of life. We believe that Britain is Stronger, safer and better off in Europe."  Leave.eu, one of the groups campaign for EU exit, dismissed Goldman Sachs' involvement.  Its founder, UKIP donor Arron Banks, tweeted: "No surprise to those of us who have said all along EU referendum will be a campaign of British people against the establishment of international bankers, multinational corporate tax dodgers and out-of-touch politicians."  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the referendum date would only be decided once the UK has a deal on a renegotiated membership, amid speculation that an agreement next month would open the door for a vote in June.  Speaking in Edinburgh on Wednesday, he said: "If we get a deal, a June vote would be a possibility in terms of the timescales of the Referendum Act but that will only be decided once we've got a deal."  Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Labour MPs launched their own campaign to leave the EU, called Labour Leave, backed by the businessman John Mills.	politics

The EU wants to scrap the rule that means refugees must claim asylum in the first country they arrive in, and introduce a new dispersal scheme.  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker says he wants a deal on refugees around the same time as one on David Cameron's renegotiation demands.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he was "very concerned" by the idea.  Mr Juncker said he was "convinced the EU Council in February will reach a fair deal for Britain", which Mr Cameron has said will pave the way for an in/out referendum later this year.  But Mr Juncker added: "I am worried we won't have enough time to tackle there the refugee question in sufficient depth. I recommend to (European Council President) Donald Tusk that he holds a further summit.  "We can't have a success on the UK and not address the refugee quotas, that would be a mistake."  The European Commission wants to scrap what is known as the Dublin agreement, which dictates refugees must claim asylum in the "first country of entry".  Mr Juncker says he wants a "fairer" system that does not place the burden on "three or four countries" that "are dealing with the situation on their own," while "some countries aren't complying with their responsibilities".  "A very large number of refugees are targeting specific countries, refugees want to decide where they want to go, and that is simply unacceptable," he added.  Some EU states have brought in temporary border controls as migrants travelled north from Italy and Greece - and Brussels fears the passport-free Schengen area, which includes every EU nation except Britain and Ireland, could collapse if a solution is not worked out soon.  The UK could opt out of any new EU scheme to deal with refugees. So why does this matter in Westminster?  First, because if the Dublin agreement is scrapped Britain may not be able to return refugees to other EU nations.  That could mean more people settling in this country, although the numbers may be modest compared to overall migration.  Second, because the timing could be very awkward.  Imagine this: February, and David Cameron seals an EU deal which he says resets Britain's relationship, tipping control away from Europe.  March: the European Commission unveils a new plan to disperse refugees across the continent and asks the UK to take part.  However much some campaigners might try to talk about other issues, that could rapidly centre the referendum fight on the fate of refugees and levels of immigration.  Britain has been under pressure to take in more people as Europe struggles to deal with a huge influx of refugees. It has opted out of an EU quota system but pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.  The UK could opt out of any new migration quotas agreed by other EU nations - but potentially at the expense of losing the right to return refugees to other EU nations.  International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the UK would be "strongly against" any attempt to scrap the "first country of entry" rule and Britain would retain its opt-out on whatever was decided.  And Mr Hammond said the "noises" coming out of Brussels were worrying.  "We regard the Dublin Agreement as an important part of the architecture within the EU.  "And if it's going to be changed, it will need to be changed in a way that makes sense and that protects our interests."  Alanna Thomas, senior researcher at Migration Watch UK, said: "The Dublin regulation was undermined this summer when Angela Merkel committed to processing all asylum applications from Syrian nationals who entered Germany."  But the Refugee Council said the Dublin system "has never been fit for purpose and is inherently unfair on Europe's border nations".  Refugee Council policy manager Judith Dennis said: "At the moment, under the Dublin regulation, asylum seekers are shuttled around the continent like unwanted luggage, and at great expense, as states in northern Europe try to shirk their responsibility towards protecting refugees.  "It's absolutely clear that we need to see a more equitable system for sharing responsibility across Europe for protecting refugees and enabling them to reunite with their family members here.  "Protecting refugees isn't just a job for the Greeks and the Italians; they simply don't have the ability to deliver a continent's worth of compassion alone. It's vital that all countries across Europe, including Britain, step forward and offer to help the desperate refugees arriving in Europe find safety."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35363865	Tory MP Crispin Blunt 'outs himself' as popper user	A Conservative MP has told the House of Commons he is a user of the popper recreational drug and a ban on its supply would be "fantastically stupid".  Ex-minister Crispin Blunt said users of the drug were "astonished" by talk of a ban and respect for the law "would fly out of the window" if it happened.  Supplying the drug, which is popular with gay men, could be outlawed under the Psychoactive Substances Bill.  MPs have rejected calls to exempt poppers from the legislation.  Following a debate in the Commons, they voted by 309 to 228 against the move.  The government wants to crack down on the sale and use of so-called legal highs, psychoactive substances chemically designed to mimic drugs that are already banned. Some 18 deaths in England and Wales in 2014 were linked to so-called legal highs.  But plans to ban the supply of poppers as part of the legislation have caused controversy.  Poppers, the name given to a group of chemicals called alkyl nitrites, are normally sniffed from a bottle producing a short head-rush. They are used recreationally and are often referred to as a "party drug".  During a debate on the bill in the Commons, Mr Blunt - who is the uncle of actress Emily Blunt and is a former prisons minister - said he would be "directly affected" by the ban.  "There are sometimes that something is proposed which becomes personal to you and you realise the government is about to do something fantastically stupid and in those circumstances one has a duty to speak up," he said.  "I use poppers. I out myself as a user of poppers. I am astonished to find it (the government) is proposing it to be banned and frankly so would many other gay men."  Mr Blunt, who came out as gay in 2010, said the drug had been used for decades and a ban would "simply serve to bring the whole law into disrepute". He warned that banning it would "drive supply underground into the hands of criminals" and increase the use of Class A and Class B drugs.  He later told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he had not suffered any adverse affects from using the drug and there was no "serious evidence" that it posed such a risk. "I think it was the most powerful argument to make and I didn't want to be a hypocrite," he said of his Commons statement.  Personal possession of poppers will not be criminalised as a result of the proposed legislation but there would be a blanket ban on their production, supply and importation, and the police would be authorised to shut down websites selling them.  Critics say this has not been thought through, pointing to a report by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs which concluded that their misuse is "not seen to be capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a societal problem".  Labour spokeswoman Lyn Brown told the Commons that she had heard that use of the drug "enhances sexual experience".  The shadow Home Office minister said her party supported the government in tackling "the scourge of these dangerous substances" but opposed a specific ban on poppers, saying they had been in use for 30 years and no government had sought to ban them.  "I am greatly disappointed the government has chosen not to place poppers on the exemptions list," she said. "I do believe this will undermine the bill and place popper users, particularly men who have sex with men, at greater use of harm."  Home Office minister Mike Penning assured MPs that a ban on poppers would not permanently take affect without a further review of the evidence, initially by the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority and then by an independent expert.  The review would report by the summer, with a decision to be taken jointly by the Home Office and Department of Health, he told MPs.  "I think that is a compromise," he said. "I think I have listened extensively. I know this is going to be difficult for individuals. I fully respect individuals' views bit I hope everyone in the house respects that I am trying to do the right thing to protect people."  But Mr Blunt, who survived attempts to deselect him in 2013 by members of the Conservative association in his Reigate constituency, said the government could find itself in the strange position of banning the supply of poppers in April and then "unbanning" them later this year.  The likely effect of this, he added, was that users of poppers would end up "stocking up".  David Raynes, from the National Drug Prevention Alliance, said he was surprised by Mr Blunt's intervention.  "Poppers are not an innocuous substance," he told PM.  "The government's own website talks about deaths.  "It talks about heart problems and talks about eyesight problems.  "If people in important positions in public life speak about these things, they are bound to affect the culture and indeed may encourage young people to use them.  "He has had months to make his representations.  "And I deplore the fact it has been done so late in the day and so noisily."	politics

Mr Cameron said replacing bursaries with loans would mean more nurses would be trained - and scrapping student grants would let more go to university.  He accused Mr Corbyn of wanting to "cap aspiration".  But the Labour leader said the PM was saddling students with debt and robbing the NHS of talented would-be nurses.  The Labour leader attempted to strike a headmasterly tone, peering over his glasses with disapproval at a Tory heckler and asking "are you done?"  He stuck to the same broad theme for his six questions and used two crowd-sourced questions, from student Liam and aspiring nurse Vicky.  There were nods of approval from deputy Tom Watson as Mr Corbyn tried to throw Mr Cameron's jibes about being against aspiration back at him.  Aspiration was Mr Cameron's word of the day, as he repeatedly accused the Labour leader of trying to "cap" it.  He ended with the now traditional jibe that he is a threat to national security, broadening it out to cover the entire Labour Party - as well as saying they were retreating into the past.  "We've seen it with wanting to bring back secondary picketing, they want to bring back flying pickets, we've seen it with the idea of stopping businesses paying dividends, and with the absurd idea that nuclear submarines should go to sea without their missiles.  "Anyone watching this Labour Party - and it's not now just the leader, it's the whole Labour Party - they are a risk to our national security, a risk to our economic security, a risk to our health service, and to the security of every family in our country."  Mr Corbyn asked why a student called Liam, who is training to be a maths teacher, would finish his course with debts of more than £50,000, roughly twice his annual income.  Mr Cameron replied: "What I would say to Liam is he is now in a country with a university system with more people going to university than ever before and more people from low-income backgrounds going to university than ever before.  "In addition, what I would say to Liam, and I wish him well, is that he will not pay back a penny of his loan until he's earning £21,000, he will not start paying back in full until he's earning £35,000.  "Our policy is actually going to put more money in the hands of students like Liam, which is why we're doing it."  He claimed Labour plans to scrap loans and fees would cost £10bn, meaning the country would go back to "a situation where people went out, worked hard, pay their taxes for an elite to go to university".  On Tuesday, Labour failed in a last-ditch bid to block the replacement of student maintenance grants in England, which are worth up to £3,500 for university students from poorer families, with loans.  Mr Corbyn asked why student nurses in England were being hit with an effective pay cut of £900 through the scrapping of bursaries, quoting the example of "Vicky", a single mother from York, who said she could not afford to train as a mental health nurse.  Mr Cameron claimed "two out of three Vickys.. who want to be nurses" are rejected under the current system and nurses have to be brought in from "Bulgaria and Romania" to do jobs that home-grown nurses should be doing.  Mr Corbyn claimed "nine out of 10 hospitals currently have a nurse shortage" and the government's plans would make this worse.  The Labour leader then highlighted comments from Tory MP and former nurse Maria Caulfield who said she would have struggled to train without a bursary.  Mr Cameron denied this, claiming the proposals would actually "uncap" the numbers that go into nursing and create 10,000 extra nurse degree places.  Jeremy Corbyn was barracked by Conservative MPs after David Cameron reaffirmed the government's support for Falkland islanders' right to self-determination and rejection of Argentina's claim to the Falklands, which Buenos Aires has maintained since the 1982 war.  Speaking after the Commons clash, a senior Labour source said the party supported "self-determination" for the Falkland Islanders but there was a need for a fresh dialogue with Argentina "to seek a long-term solution to the conflict".  Mr Corbyn sparked controversy in a weekend TV interview by saying he wanted discussions on "some reasonable accommodation" with Argentina, adding that the islanders should have an "enormous say" in any discussions on their future,  The Conservatives had some Beatles-related fun with Jeremy Corbyn's suggestion, in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, that the UK could retain its nuclear missile submarines but send them to sea without their warheads.  Lincoln MP Karl McCartney set the prime minister up, claiming that Labour's defence policy was "inspired by The Beatles' Yellow Submarine and shows that while the members opposite may Twist And Shout, their current leader certainly needs Help".  Mr Cameron hailed his "ingenious" question before providing the punchline: "All I can say when it comes to Beatles songs, I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition prefers Back In The USSR."	politics

Labour has revealed that it failed to include invoices for the plinth to the Electoral Commission as part of its total general election spending.  It blamed the omission on an "administrative error".  Labour spent £12m on the campaign, the watchdog's figures show, compared with £15.5m spent by the Conservatives.  In total, £39m was spent by the UK's six largest parties on the campaign, an increase on the £34.4m spent in 2010 but lower than the record £42m spent in 2005.  Although comfortably outspending Labour over the regulated period - between 23 May 2014 and 7 May 2015 - the Conservatives spent less than in 2010, when their budget was £16.6m. In contrast, Labour spent more than in 2010, when their total outlay was £8m.  A breakdown of the figures show the Conservatives spent 27.7% of their budget on "unsolicited material", such as flyers, and 23.2% on advertising while Labour spent 61% of their budget on "unsolicited material" and 7.6% on advertising.  Spending on rallies accounted for 13% of Labour's total expenditure compared with the Conservatives' 5% while the Conservatives spent 30.1% of their budget on market research and canvassing against Labour's 7.7% outlay.  The Conservatives spent £1.2m on advertising on Facebook in the year before the poll while Labour spent just over £16,000.  Ed Miliband unveiled the eight foot stone carving on the final weekend of the campaign, saying that it would be installed in the garden of Downing Street to remind the party of its duty to honour its six main election promises.  The move was met with near universal derision by the media and the subsequent fate of what became known as the "Ed Stone" has been unclear. Various unconfirmed reports have suggested it resides in a warehouse in London or has been destroyed.  Spending on the stone is not included in the Electoral Commission data released on Wednesday.  Labour said: "Due to an administrative error these invoices were not included with other items of campaign spend. We have informed the Electoral Commission and will seek to rectify this error as soon as possible."  The figures do not cover some administrative spending, for instance on staff, while spending by individual candidates is reported separately.  The SNP reported the biggest rise in spending compared with 2010, when their expenditure totalled £316,000. In contrast, the Lib Dems' spending fell from £4.7m in 2010 to £3.5m last year.  The UK Independence Party spent £2.8m while the Greens spent £1.1m. UKIP spent the least per vote gained while the SNP spent least per MP won.  In the 2015 general election the Conservatives had 331 MPs elected, Labour 232, the SNP 56, and the Lib Dems 8.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35360273	Ebola: $5m vaccine deal announced	The Vaccine Alliance, Gavi, has signed a $5m (£3.5m) deal for an Ebola vaccine, to protect against future outbreaks of the deadly disease.  The deal commits pharmaceutical company Merck to keeping 300,000 vaccines ready for emergency use or further clinical trials.  It will also license the vaccine by the end of 2017, which would allow Gavi to prepare a global stockpile.  More than 11,000 people have died in the latest outbreak in West Africa.  The sheer scale of the outbreak - the largest in history - led to an unprecedented push on vaccines, which condensed a decade's work into less than a year.  Merck has led trials of the VSV-EBOV vaccine - which combines a fragment of the Ebola virus with another safer virus in order to train the immune system to beat Ebola.  Early evidence from studies in West Africa suggest it may give 100% protection, although more data is still being collected.  Dr Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, said: "The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health community.  "New threats require smart solutions, and our innovative financing agreement with Merck will ensure that we are ahead of the curve for future Ebola outbreaks."  Gavi, an alliance of public bodies and companies committed to saving lives through vaccination, announced the advanced-purchase commitment at the World Economic Forum held at Davos in the Swiss Alps.  The $5m paid to Merck will be offset against any vaccines Gavi orders once the shot is licensed.  The World Health Organization declared West Africa Ebola-free last week, after all of the affected countries had gone 42 days without a case.  But then, just hours later, a death in Sierra Leone was confirmed to be from Ebola.  The WHO has warned more flare-ups are expected.  Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust medical research charity, said VSV-EBOV had shown "remarkable results" and was one of the "few positive outcomes" to emerge from the epidemic.  He said: "As we saw with the new confirmed case just last week, the Ebola epidemic is likely to have a long tail and it's possible that several more isolated cases will emerge in the coming weeks and months.  "This vaccine, therefore, could still play an important role in containing any additional flare-ups of this outbreak, as well as being available to help prevent future epidemics."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35350419	Should polling be banned before an election?	The political implications of the polling errors at the 2015 general election were quite profound.  The six-week campaign was dominated by 92 voting intention polls, very few of which came anywhere near the actual outcome of a Conservative victory.  The fact that most polls suggested a hung parliament shaped the entire campaign.  Detailed interrogation of party policies took a back seat to endless discussion about who would go into coalition with whom.  And the final weeks before polling day were so dominated by talk about the SNP that one could have been forgiven for thinking it was a Holyrood election rather than one for Westminster.  Should we cut through all this and simply ban the publication of opinion polls during election campaigns?  Pollsters object that, in the event of a ban, privately commissioned polls would be commissioned and their findings published abroad and then reported in the UK media. It would be virtually impossible to suppress them in this age of the internet.  A reasonable point: but does it invalidate the argument that election polls should be banned?  A 2012 international study conducted by the University of Hong Kong received replies from 83 countries when asked whether they operated any blackout period for polls during election campaigns.  Of these, 38 countries reported bans on the publication of pre-election polls in one form or another.  The list included Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, Norway, Poland and Venezuela. In France, election polls are banned on polling day and the day before.  It is difficult to characterise the list as comprising countries where democracy is fragile and where authoritarian regimes prevail.  So, many mature democracies find no problem with restricting pre-election polls.  Would our own politics be any the poorer if such a ban were introduced?  In the absence of obsessive interest in the party horse race, might we discuss important subjects such as what the next government proposes to do for five years: the state of the economy, housing, the environment, schools and universities and the National Health Service?  However, if we ban the polls we could also lose the information they provide that is over and beyond simple voting intention, not least the priorities expressed by potential voters.  Polls contain very rich data about voter attitudes that the media often does not report.  But that suggests the media should sort itself out rather than Parliament legislating to cut off the supply.  There is also the argument that polls, with all their shortcomings, are far better than the alternatives we would be left with in the event of their being banned.  Would our news-hungry media fill the gap with leaks of "private" polls commissioned by political parties, ostensibly for their own use?  Or worse still, would every election campaign be splattered with reports of "sensational" canvass returns released by parties showing that they were sweeping the country in this election?  Rumour and spin do not appear to be particularly attractive alternatives to opinion polls.  For my part, I am not persuaded that polls should be banned during election campaigns.  However, I think the pollsters are on a short leash: their dreadful performance in 2015 and the damaging role they played in misdirecting the entire six weeks of the campaign have shaken public confidence quite severely.  If they cannot restore that public confidence quickly they will find themselves bereft of friends and supporters should the appetite grow for curtailing their activities during crucial election campaigns.	politics

New research published in The British Medical Journal studied more than 4 million people around the world, but it's not entirely clear why women may be more at risk.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35347559	Irregular heartbeat 'riskier for women'	Having an irregular heartbeat poses a greater health risk to women than men, a review of 30 studies, involving more than four million patients, suggests.  The women with atrial fibrillation (AF) were almost twice as likely to have fatal heart disease and strokes.  Women may respond less well to AF drugs or are being diagnosed later than men.  "One possibility is that women with AF are undertreated relative to men," Connor Emdin and colleagues, at the University of Oxford, told the BMJ.  In the meantime, experts say doctors should be aware of the findings in case more can be done to avert avoidable deaths.  About a million people in the UK have AF.  You can check if you might have it by feeling your pulse for about 30 seconds.  An occasional irregularity in pulse, such as a missed beat or extra beats, is common and nothing to worry about.  But if your pulse is continuously irregular with no pattern, you should see your doctor.  It may also be very fast, more than 100 beats per minute even when resting, leading to dizziness and shortness of breath.  Medicines can control AF and reduce the risk of a stroke (a clot or bleed in the brain).  In patients with AF, the heart's upper chambers - the atria - contract randomly and sometimes so fast the heart muscle cannot relax properly between contractions, reducing its efficiency.  June Davison, from the British Heart Foundation, said AF was under-diagnosed in both men and women.  "It is important that healthcare services for the prevention and treatment of AF take into account the different effects of gender on the condition," she said.  "More research is needed to find out more about the underlying causes of these differences."	health

The report, written by former Cabinet minister Dame Margaret Beckett, said the comparative standing of the two men was one of four reasons for the defeat.  Other factors identified were failures in economic and immigration policy and the fear of the SNP propping up Labour.  The report said Labour faced a "huge challenge" to win again in 2020.  The report concludes that the party needs a massive upswing in its fortunes in England and Scotland if it is to be returned to power in five years time.  It urges the party to do more to appeal to older voters and to construct a clear "policy narrative" that can be sold to the public.  The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the analysis made "sobering reading" for Labour, with weaknesses identified in key areas.  The report concluded that Labour's "ground campaign" during the election was strong but suggests many voters had already made their minds up and opinion polls suggesting it was neck and neck with the Conservatives were wrong.  Pollsters and activists on the doorstep consistently heard four reasons for the party's defeat, which saw it lose ground in key marginal seats in England and found itself all but wiped out in Scotland. They were:  On the issue of leadership, the report argues that Mr Miliband enjoyed a "surge" in 2015 and performed well during the campaign itself.  But it says he was unable to shift public perceptions, borne out in opinion polls, that David Cameron was regarded as more "prime ministerial".  "Over the period 2010-15, what the polls did consistently show was that, when asked if 'this man could be prime minister', David Cameron was rated above Ed Miliband. Since he actually was prime minister, this response was perhaps less than surprising.  "It is the fate of every Labour leader of the opposition to be the target of ferocious attack from partisans sections of the media," it added. "However, Ed Miliband faced an exceptionally vitriolic and personal attack."  The report says assumptions that Labour lost the election because it was too left-wing and because its policies were unpopular was overly simplistic and should be treated with caution, pointing out that the party's most radical initiatives - such as an energy price freeze and mansion tax on expensive properties - were among those most liked by the public.  But it says Labour lacked a consistent over-arching theme and struggled to communicate its approach to the voters in contrast to the "brutal simplicity of the Tories and UKIP".  "The reaction to the 2015 result was inevitably an emotional one for Labour because it was such a surprise," Dame Margaret said.  "There was certainly no complacency in the Labour ranks, but the polls showed us neck and neck with the Tories, when clearly we weren't.  "There are certainly lessons to learn from defeat. This report has been a key part of recognising areas we need to improve on and building on aspects of our campaign that performed well."  On the challenge facing Labour in 2020, the report concluded: "It is critically important for the country that Labour is able to win the 2020 election but we will face huge challenges. On current boundaries we need 94 gains to secure a majority of two.  "Were Labour to fail to recover in Scotland, it has been estimated that the swing required in England and Wales from the Tories to Labour would be 12.5% to secure an overall majority."  Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the party must pay close attention to the report as it sought to "remake its appeal", telling the BBC that Labour had come back from heavy defeats before and would do again.  But Tom Baldwin, Mr Miliband's former director of communications, said the current leadership had not given enough thought to why Labour lost. "Unless we start thinking about why we lost, we won't be able to win again," he told the BBC News Channel.  And the Conservatives said the report showed Labour "still haven't learnt the lessons from their economic mistakes" between 2005 and 2010, in relation to excessive levels of spending and borrowing.	politics

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said he would table "concrete proposals" for discussion at February's summit of EU leaders in Brussels.  Should a deal be reached, it would open the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership being held in June.  A poll must be held by the end of 2017, but the PM is thought to favour 2016.  Downing Street responded to Mr Tusk's comments by saying the process would be driven by "substance not schedule".  And a spokesman added: "But a deal in February would pave the way for getting on with this."  Mr Cameron is trying to negotiate a "better deal" for the UK in the European Union as a prelude to holding an in-out referendum on whether the UK should remain a member.  Negotiations are focused on four key areas: economic governance, sovereignty, competitiveness and curbs on EU migration to the UK.  Both sides are insisting progress is being made but that obstacles remain, particularly in relation to the UK's proposal for EU migrants to have to wait four years before being able to claim in-work benefits.  Holding a referendum in the first half of 2016 - which senior government ministers reportedly favour - effectively hinges on the other 27 EU members agreeing to the UK's proposals next month.  Mr Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who now chairs meetings of the European Council, has raised expectations of an agreement, tweeting that he would put forward detailed proposals in the run-up to the summit.  "I will work hard for deal in February, not easy but possible," he wrote. The European Council, he added, had "demonstrated willingness to look for compromises" in all four areas without "compromising fundamental values".  He told a plenary session of the European Parliament that a set of changes allowing the UK to remain in the EU was urgently needed.  The BBC's Brussels correspondent Ben Wright said months of intensive diplomacy between London, Brussels and EU capitals will come to a head when Mr Tusk circulates draft conclusions to which he hopes every leader will agree. While a deal was expected, he said it was not inevitable.  No 10 would not be drawn on the PM's preferred referendum date after Scottish Secretary David Mundell suggested there was no obstacle to it being held in June - a stance opposed by the SNP because of its proximity to May's elections to the Scottish Parliament.  Speaking on Tuesday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage predicted a weak compromise on the issue of migrant benefits. Citing the sexual assaults on German women in Cologne on New Year's Eve, he claimed the issue of border control and the safety of British women would be central to the referendum.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35347948	Election polling errors blamed on 'unrepresentative' samples	The failure of pollsters to forecast the outcome of the general election was largely due to "unrepresentative" poll samples, an inquiry has found.  The polling industry came under fire for predicting a virtual dead heat when the Conservatives ultimately went on to outpoll Labour by 36.9% to 30.4%.  A panel of experts has concluded this was due to Tory voters being under-represented in phone and online polls.  But it said it was impossible to say whether "late swing" was also a factor.  The majority of polls taken during last year's five-week election campaign suggested that David Cameron's Conservatives and Ed Miliband's Labour were neck-and-neck.  This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern.  But, as it turned out, the Conservatives secured an overall majority in May for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise.  The result prompted the polling industry to launch an independent inquiry into the accuracy of their research, the reasons for any inaccuracies and how polls were analysed and reported.  An interim report by the panel of academics and statisticians found that the way in which people were recruited to take part - asking about their likely voting intentions - had resulted in "systematic over-representation of Labour voters and under-representation of Conservative voters".  These oversights, it found, had resulted in a "statistical consensus".  Most general election opinion polls are either carried out over the phone or on the internet. They are not entirely random - the companies attempt to get a representative sample of the population, in age and gender, and the data is adjusted afterwards to try and iron out any bias, taking into account previous voting behaviour and other factors.  But they are finding it increasingly difficult to reach a broad enough range of people. It is not a question of size - bigger sample sizes are not necessarily more accurate.  YouGov, which pays a panel of thousands of online volunteers to complete surveys, admitted they did not have access to enough people in their seventies and older, who were more likely to vote Conservative. They have vowed to change their methods.  Telephone polls have good coverage of the population, but they suffer from low response rates - people refusing to take part in their surveys, which can lead to bias.  How pre-election polls got it wrong  This, it said, was borne out by polls taken after the general election by the British Election Study and the British Social Attitudes Survey, which produced a much more accurate assessment of the Conservatives' lead over Labour.  NatCen, who conducted the British Social Attitudes Survey, has described making "repeated efforts" to contact those it had selected to interview - and among those most easily reached, Labour had a six-point lead.  However, among the harder-to-contact group, who took between three and six calls to track down, the Conservatives were 11 points ahead.  Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown, who famously dismissed the election night exit poll with a promise to eat his hat if it was true, said the polls had a "considerable" impact on the way people voted.  He told BBC Radio 4's the World At One: "The effect of the polls was to hugely increase the power of the Conservative message and hugely decrease the power of the Liberal Democrat message, which was you need us to make sure they don't do bad things."  The peer claimed the "mood of the nation" was for another coalition and voters were "surprised" when the Conservatives won outright.  "I think, therefore, there is an argument to be made that it actually materially altered the outcome of the election."  Evidence of a last-minute swing to the Conservatives was "inconsistent", the polling experts said, and if it did happen its effect was likely to have been modest.  They also downplayed other potential explanations for why the polls got it wrong, such as misreporting of voter turnout, problems with question wording or how overseas, postal or unregistered voters were treated in the polls.  However, the panel said it could not rule out the possibility of "herding" - where firms configured their polls in a way that caused them to deviate less than could have been expected from others given the sample sizes. But it stressed that did not imply malpractice on behalf of the firms concerned.  Prof Patrick Sturgis, director of the National Centre for Research Methods at the University of Southampton and chair of the panel, told the BBC: "They don't collect samples in the way the Office for National Statistics does by taking random samples and keeping knocking on doors until they have got enough people.  "What they do is get anyone they can and try and match them to the population... That approach is perfectly fine in many cases but sometimes it goes wrong."  Prof Sturgis said that sort of quota sampling was cheaper and quicker than the random sampling done by the likes of the ONS, but even if more money was spent - and all of the inquiry's recommendations were all implemented - polls would still never get it right every time.  I remember the audible gasp in the BBC's election studio when David Dimbleby read out the exit poll results.  But for all that the consequences of that startling result were many and various, the reasons appear remarkably simple.  Pollsters didn't ask enough of the right people how they planned to vote. Proportionately they asked too many likely Labour voters, and not enough likely Conservatives  Politics is not a precise science and predicting how people will vote will still be a worthwhile endeavour. Political parties, journalists, and the public of course would be foolish to ignore them. But the memories and embarrassment for the polling industry of 2015 will take time to fade.  Read Laura's blog on how the pundits and pollsters got it wrong  Joe Twyman, from pollster YouGov, told the BBC it was becoming increasingly difficult to recruit people to take part in surveys - despite, in YouGov's case, paying them to do so - but all efforts would be made to recruit subjects in "a more targeted manner".  "So more young people people who are disengaged with politics, for example, and more older people. We do have them on the panel, but we need to work harder to make sure they're represented sufficiently because it's clear they weren't at the election," he said.  On Tuesday, the Lords approved a bill which would create a new watchdog to regulate future polling by specifying sampling methods, producing guidance on the wording of questions and deciding whether there should be a moratorium on polls in the run-up to elections.  But the private member's bill, tabled by Labour's Lord Foulkes, has yet to be introduced to the Commons and is unlikely to become law due to lack of parliamentary time.	politics

David Mundell said last week the UK government had no intention of re-introducing the previous scheme which was abolished in 2012.  But he told the Scottish Affairs committee the government was open to "reasonable suggestions".  Scottish minister Humza Yousaf said the UK government "was all over the place".  He added: "There is cross-sector and cross-party consensus in Scotland for the reintroduction of a post-study work visa.  "From universities and colleges right through to businesses and trade unions, it is widely recognised that giving the brightest minds from across the world the chance to work here after graduation will benefit Scotland economically, culturally and socially."  The Scottish government's Post-Study Work group said last year that the work visa should be reintroduced.  The Smith Commission, set up to look at more powers for Scotland following the independence referendum, said the Scottish and UK governments should explore the possibility of introducing "formal schemes to allow international higher education students graduating from Scottish further and higher education institutions to remain in Scotland".	politics

It was "different" because there was no lack of planning following the ousting of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011.  "We had plenty of planning but no power to implement the plans," he told the foreign affairs committee.  He said Colonel Gaddafi was to blame for the "sorry state" state of the country now.  "The responsibility for the state of Libya today rests with Colonel Gaddafi - in power for 40 years, with hollowed out institutions and no proper system of government under a tyrannical dictatorship," he told the committee.  "The longer that went on the longer there was going to be an explosion - if he was still there today then next year or the year after there would be the revolution."  He said the UK and its allies had tried to leave Libyans to sort out things out on their own, but should perhaps have taken a "more prescriptive approach".  Libya's new leaders wanted elections "as soon as they could" but should have been persuaded to take longer over the transition to democracy, suggested the former foreign secretary.  The UK led international efforts, with France, to get a UN resolution backing anti- Gaddafi forces and attempted to support the building of a stable democracy after the dictator had been ousted.  But the country rapidly descended into violence and instability, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.  Mr Hague told the MPs: "I think we have to be careful to think it's another Iraq. The problems are different to Iraq. The problem here is not that a lot of people didn't think about the post-conflict at the time.  "It was that, unlike in Iraq, they didn't have the power to implement what was decided, or what was planned, after the conflict."  Mr Hague said there was "some parallel" with Iraq because of the "hostility to Gaddafi era figures" being involved in the new government.  But they did need "some of those people" because "in a country with a small population they were the only people who had run any aspect of government in the previous 40 years".  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, asked if it was a "terrible misappreciation" to believe that "a country with no democracy, no politicians, and no civil society" could become a functioning democracy in nine months.  Lord Hague said "if it was a misappreciation then it was one that was shared with the Libyan leaders". He says that from his recollection the push for democracy came from within Libya rather than from the West.  Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said she voted against military action in Libya at the time "because I foresaw exactly what would happen".  Ms Qureshi said "we just don't understand the Middle East and we should not be intervening militarily in these countries".  Lord Hague said he respected that viewpoint but "if you think slaughter is about to take place and you have the capability to do something then you should".  Speaking earlier to the same committee, Liam Fox, who sat alongside Lord Hague in the cabinet as defence secretary at the time of the conflict, said the main momentum for the intervention came from Paris rather than from London or Washington.  He said there was "no real appetite" among British military leaders to get involved in another conflict, as the UK was already involved in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time.  He had not been given advance warning of French air strikes, launched on 19 March 2011, hours after the UN resolution authorising them had been passed, he told the committee.  His own view was the the French were keen to show they were "serious players" in Nato again, given the "reticence" of the US government to get involved in Libya.  As for post-conflict planning, he said there had been concerns about a power vacuum developing and potential problems with guerrilla groups.  "There was a view that there was such a disparate grouping of rebels that some groups would have extremist elements, but I have no memory of any specific group being identified at the time."  He said the UK had offered the Libyan transitional government help with taking central control of militia groups but "nothing ever came of it".  There should have been more thought about what a "good outcome" for Libya would look like and to what extent the UK should be involved in delivering it, adding: "experience does add a great deal".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35350361	Q&A: How do opinion polls work?	The 2015 general election result took political pollsters by surprise and a panel of experts has now said that, put simply, their predictions were wrong because they spoke to the wrong people.  But what exactly is polling, how does it work and why is it so hard to get the right answer?  In a nutshell, it's a scientific survey designed to measure the views of a particular group of people - for example, the UK electorate.  You don't have to eat an entire bowl of soup to know if it tastes good - if it's properly stirred, one spoonful is enough.  That's the analogy most commonly used to explain the principles behind polling - if you ask the right people, they can be relatively small in number but still give you an accurate representation of the views of everyone.  Well, anybody can carry out a survey, but those that pass muster - and reach a "scientific" standard - are done predominantly by reputable, independent polling companies. The 10 which featured most prominently in the 2015 general election were Ashcroft, ComRes, ICM, Ipsos MORI, Opinium, Panelbase, Populus, Survation, TNS and YouGov.  They carry out some polls independently while others are funded by media organisation. And then some are conducted on behalf of a partisan client - a particular political party, lobbying organisation, or interest group - who may be commissioning the survey because they expect a particular response and will only make the results public if the answers are to their liking.  The perfect option would be to obtain a genuinely random sample of people, but in reality that's nigh on impossible. You'd have to pick them from the electoral roll, but that doesn't have any phone numbers or email addresses, so you'd have to show up on the doorstep of every single one of them - and then they'd all have to agree to talk to you. Alternatively, you could send them all a letter but that would takes ages and the response rate would be very poor.  Instead, polling firms use something called quota sampling. It involves designing a sample of people that's representative of the population as a whole, with the right balance of gender, age, socio-economic background, and so on. Interviewers then have to go out and find them to tick each one of those boxes.  Results can also be weighted, so if you only manage to find 100 people aged 18 to 34, but needed to find 110, you can weight the response of each one of those you did find to count as 1.1 people in order to better reflect the population as a whole.  Most commonly, it's done over the phone or via the internet.  One of the biggest firms, YouGov, does its polls online. It has collected a panel of more than 360,000 people in a variety of ways - including via standard advertising. Then, when it needs to conduct a particular poll, it chooses a quota sample from that panel. Those people are then asked to fill in an online survey.  Ipsos MORI is one of the firms to use phone polling. Its explains that its call a combination of mobiles and landlines through random-digit dialling, which means they find ex-directory people as well as those in the phone book. The interviewer takes demographic details from whoever picks up so they can see where they fit in the quota sample.  Bear in mind though, that those who are unemployed, retired or work from home are more likely to answer the phone. And, as the UK Polling Report puts it: "There may also be attitudinal biases - people who are willing to give 20 minutes of their life to a stranger on the phone asking impertinent questions may have a different outlook on life to those who won't."  A biased sample of a million people is no better than a biased sample of a thousand. The bigger the scientific sample the better, but a polling company - and the entity paying for the poll - has to balance the cost and time involved with the accuracy of the result.  The more people you question the longer it takes and the more it costs - and if you're trying to track day-to-day changes in voter sentiment, it simply isn't practical to question vast numbers of people each time. A sample size of around 1,000 is often settled upon as a good balance.  An independent inquiry, commissioned by the British Polling Council and the Market Research Society, found that pollsters spoke to too many likely Labour voters and not enough likely Conservatives.  The biggest reason was that not enough older people - who are more likely to be Tory voters - were questioned.  Tory voters in general are also said by pollsters to be more likely to put the phone down or be ex-directory, and less likely to answer the door. And busy professionals who have less time to respond to polls are statistically more likely who vote Conservative.  Weighting should ease these sorts of problems, and has done in the past, but it appears it wasn't effective enough in 2015.  Those questioned were also more engaged in politics than average, which led the pollsters to make errors about the expected level of turnout among different groups. They knew that turnout would be higher among older voters than younger voters but they underestimated the difference.  Finally, the experts suggested there might have been "herding" - polling firms stuck together, not wanting to go out on a limb, so they designed their surveys and weighted their responses to fall closely in line with their rivals.  That they'll do better next time. They'll recruit more older people, rework their models to produce more accurate results. Joe Twyman, from YouGov, compared the situation to the Met Office after it failed to predict the 1987 hurricane. It went back to the drawing board, he said, found better ways to make predictions, and now generally speaking, people trust its forecasts again.  However, Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, has made the point that resources are an issue. Just three of his 1,500 employees in London are doing election polling and the money available to do it is "miniscule" compared to what's spent on other sorts of research.  All the pollsters also point out that even a "perfect" random sample, conducted on an infinite budget, will, just by the laws of probability be outside the margin of error one time in 20.  It's rule one in the politician's handbook - always say you don't pay any attention to polls - but of course, the reality is quite different.  Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has accused the "commentariat" of being "too relaxed" about the pollsters' failure, saying he believes it affected the result of the election because all the talk in the run-up was about the all-but-inevitable hung parliament, meaning people voted on that basis.  Former Lib Dem minister Norman Lamb agrees, telling the BBC that endless talk of what would happen in the event of a hung parliament - particularly the doom-laden Tory warnings of an SNP-Labour tie-up - led people to vote "out of fear" for the Conservatives. He believes that if the polls had correctly predicted a Tory majority, people would have voted differently.  Some countries, France, Spain and Italy among them, ban all opinion polling for a defined period in the run-up to an election.  Following last May's vote, one Labour peer, Lord Foulkes, called for just such a ban in the UK, accusing newspapers of using polls as a tool to sway voters, creating a "bandwagon" for people to jump on rather than providing an independent assessment of the public mood.  The suggestion was dismissed by ComRes chief Andrew Hawkins who said it would be "bad for democracy" and, given the existence of social and other online media, an attempt to ban opinion polls would be pointless. He also said it was "insulting" to the electorate to suggest they'd be swayed by poll findings.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35352911	48-hour junior doctors' strike called off	The 48-hour junior doctors' strike due to start next Tuesday in England has been called off by the British Medical Association  The decision comes as talks continue this week between the doctors' union and the government about the disputed junior doctor contract in England.  The BMA said the move did not mean a deal had been reached.  A planned strike on Wednesday 10 February could still go ahead if the negotiations stall.  That stoppage is considered to be potentially the most disruptive as it is a complete walk-out, whereas next week's one - like the 24-hour strike held last Tuesday - still saw junior doctors provide emergency cover.  The decision to call off next week's strike is good news for patients. Last week more than one in 10 operations were cancelled because of the 24-hour walk-out.  But it would be dangerous to read too much into the decision. The two sides are really no closer to agreement than they were before that stoppage.  Payment for weekend working, career progression and the safeguards being proposed to stop hospitals over-working doctors still remain the key sticking points.  The reasoning behind cancelling next week's stoppage is pretty obvious. It allows the British Medical Association to say it is thinking about patients, while also ensuring the on-going talks can take place without stopping - as they did last week - during industrial action.  By holding the first strike the BMA ensured its mandate for action did not expire. So it can call off this action safe in the knowledge it still has its strongest bargaining chip - a full walk-out on 10 February - up its sleeve.  Commenting on the decision to suspend industrial action, BMA junior doctor committee chair Dr Johann Malawana said: "The BMA's aim has always been to deliver a safe, fair junior doctor contract through negotiated agreement.  "Following junior doctors' clear message to the government during last week's action, our focus is now on building on early progress made in the current set of talks.  "On this basis, the BMA has today taken the decision to suspend the industrial action planned for 26 to 28 January, thereby giving trusts as much notice as possible so as to avoid disruption to patients.  "It is important to be clear, however, that differences still exist between the BMA and the government on key areas, including the protection of patient safety and doctor's working lives, and the recognition of unsocial hours.  "Significant, concrete progress will need to be made if future action, currently planned for 10 February, is to be averted."  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  The lessons of the 1975 doctors' strike  The decision by the BMA comes after a 24-hour walk-out by junior doctors last week. It led to over 3,000 operations being cancelled on the day - about one in 10 of those that were planned to take place.  But as soon as that finished talks restarted at the conciliation service Acas - discussion which are continuing this week.  A Department of Health spokesman said: "The strike that took place last week was unnecessary while talks are ongoing, so it's extremely welcome news that the BMA has suspended next week's action.  "In the end, the government and junior doctors want to do the same thing by improving patient care at weekends - and we look forward to further constructive discussions."	health

The position, in her Edmonton constituency office, will now be re-advertised with a £9.40 an hour salary.  "Kate does not believe in paying anyone less than the London Living Wage," a spokeswoman said.  Ms Osamor, who was promoted to Labour's front bench in Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle, campaigns against low pay.  The original advertisement, on the W4MP jobs board, for a constituency intern, listed responsibilities including " community-based projects relating to the constituency", gathering and evaluating data and "general administrative support".  It asked for degree-level qualifications, "enthusiasm" and "commitment to the full duration of the role". The salary was listed as "expenses" and it was described as a "voluntary role".  The advert was withdrawn after Ms Osamor, who entered Parliament in May's general election, came under fire from campaigners. Tanya De Grunwald, a campaigner for fair internships and founder of careers website Graduate Fog said it was "astonishing" that MPs were still failing to connect the dots between their political principles and their own hiring practices.  Ms De Grunwald said it was "great" that the ad had been taken down but she said it was "disappointing that mistakes like this are still happening when surely everyone is aware of how unfair unpaid internships are by now. When you post an ad for an unpaid role you should know in your gut that it's wrong."  She said MPs needed to "sort out proper processes for hiring these roles so errors and misunderstandings like this can't happen".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35349081	UK should have listened to Ebola warnings, report says	The UK government should have paid more attention to warnings about Ebola before a formal emergency was declared, a group of MPs has said in a report.  A Commons committee said the government had been "too reliant" on the World Health Organisation (WHO) system, which declared an emergency in August 2014.  Instead it should have listened to other groups that were warning about Ebola months earlier, the report said.  But the government said its "swift and effective action" saved thousands.  The WHO has since set out plans to reform after health experts said its response to the outbreak was too slow.  The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014.  Some 11,315 people are reported to have died from the disease in six countries: Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali.  The Commons' international development committee said groups like Medecins Sans Frontieres had raised the alarm about Ebola months before the WHO did.  The committee said the Department for International Development (DfID) "must ensure it has the ability to listen and react to information and warnings from a range of sources".  Instead it was "still relying too much on improvements on the international system without improving its own ability to independently assess international public health risks", the MPs concluded.  Committee chairman Stephen Twigg said: "The international community relied on WHO to sound the alarm for an international emergency on the scale of Ebola. The organisation's failure to respond quickly enough is now well documented.  "DfID operated effectively once the international response began in earnest.  "However, the department should have been able to pick up on warnings from sources beyond the established international system."  The committee also said it should be made easier for small sums of aid funding to be allocated after hearing from a doctor who was refused £7,500 in the early stages of the outbreak.  An inability to deal with small sums "may have hampered" the response, the report said, cautioning that "playing catch-up" usually proved more expensive.  Mr Twigg added: "It is vital that these lessons are learned as every delay counts. We urge DfID to lead efforts and make this reform a priority."  A DfID spokeswoman said the UK was "at the forefront of tackling this unprecedented epidemic" and this was "months before the first cases of Ebola were confirmed in Sierra Leone.  "We simultaneously pushed the international system to respond more quickly," she said.  "From rapidly deploying NHS medics and military personnel to building treatment centres, our swift and effective action helped save thousands of lives and contain the spread of the disease.  "Our flexible response is now ensuring Sierra Leone can isolate and treat new cases of Ebola before they spread."	politics

Until now, checks have only been applied to nurses outside the EU.  It means any nurse who is unable to show they have sufficient language skills will need to have an English language assessment.  The move by the Nursing and Midwifery Council brings the profession in line with doctors, who are already vetted in this way for patient safety.  The risk of a doctor not being fluent in English was highlighted by a lethal mistake made by Dr Daniel Ubani, a German doctor doing an out-of-hours shift who gave a lethal dose of a painkiller to patient David Gray in 2008.  As a German citizen he was able to register to work in the UK without passing a language test.  NMC Chief Executive Jackie Smith said: "From now on all nurses and midwives applying to join the register from outside the UK, including the EU, will have to demonstrate they can communicate effectively to a high standard of English.  "The ability to communicate effectively with patients is fundamental to patient safety and a principle that is central to our code."  And if an allegation is made that a nurse or midwife already working in the UK does not meet the necessary English language skills, they could be investigated under fitness to practise rules.  The NMC has more than 690,000 nurses and midwives on its register. Around 66,000 of these come from non-EU countries and 33,000 from the EU.  The UK is looking to recruit more foreign nurses.  In October, the government temporarily lifted restrictions on recruiting nurses from overseas by adding the profession to its Shortage Occupation List.  This means nurses from outside the European Economic Area now have their applications prioritised.  The Department of Health said the move was designed to ease pressure on the NHS without having to reply on expensive agency staff.  Katherine Murphy of The Patients Association said: "Nurses from other countries make an extremely important contribution to healthcare in the UK. However, we hear from patients on our National Helpline that there can be real issues with some overseas health professionals; including problems with communication and a lack of understanding of processes and procedures.  "The Patients Association calls on all Trusts to ensure that their staff meet these new requirements, and that all overseas nurses have the necessary support and training to be able to offer patients safe and effective care."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35344195	'Natural' fertilisation device for IVF	A private UK fertility clinic is offering couples a new form of IVF treatment that lets conception occur in the womb rather than in the lab.  Doctors hope that making fertilisation more natural will mean healthier pregnancies.  The Complete Fertility clinic in Southampton is first in the UK to use the AneVivo device method.  It is a tiny tubular capsule that is loaded with the sperm and egg before being placed into the uterus.  Prof Nick Macklon, head of the clinic, insisted it was not a gimmick.  He told the BBC: "At this stage we are just offering it to private patients. If the NHS want to use it then they would need to know that it is cost effective. We do not know that yet.  "But that doesn't mean new technology like this can't be introduced in a cautious manner. I'm very keen that we study new innovation in IVF."  The technique, which costs around £700 per go, has been approved by the UK's fertility watchdog, the HFEA.  International trials in around 250 women suggest that it achieves a similar pregnancy rate to conventional IVF, says Prof Macklon.  But it reduces how long the growing embryo is kept artificially outside of the womb in a dish of culture fluid.  Prof Macklon said: "The aim is to maximise the time spent in the body rather than in the lab. The immediate benefit is reducing exposure at this very vulnerable time of human development when genes are being switched on and off."  Some studies have suggested that growing embryos in a dish increases the risk of genetic and other health defects.  It is not yet known whether the womb device will be an improvement.  Although it allows fertilisation to occur within the body, the resulting embryo still needs to be removed and given a health check in the lab before being reimplanted (minus the device).  When the HFEA approved the technology, its advisory committee said there was no evidence that the device would be ineffective or unsafe.  However, it "did not feel that there was sufficient clinical data to say whether the process has a greater or lesser efficacy than that of traditional IVF methods" and it said the process "might add an unnecessary cost to patients".	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35345279	Donald Trump debate: Ban risks making tycoon a 'martyr'	Stopping Donald Trump from coming to the UK risks turning him into a martyr, a Labour MP has claimed during a three-hour House of Commons debate.  Paul Flynn said Mr Trump's call to ban Muslims from the US was "extremely dangerous" but barring him from the UK risked being seen as anti-American.  However, SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said a ban would be justified on the grounds of "religious harmony".  Monday's debate, which took place in a packed Westminster Hall committee room, ended without a vote.  Home Office minister James Brokenshire said the government had the power to exclude people who would "do harm" but the US was the UK's most important ally and the UK should "engage" with presidential candidates even when it "profoundly disagreed" with their views.  The tycoon, who is leading several opinion polls in the race to be the Republican candidate for President, called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US in response to the shooting of 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December.  Mr Trump's comments were criticised across the political spectrum in the US and Europe. He caused further anger by claiming that areas of London and other parts of the UK have become so radicalised that they have become no-go areas for the police.  The "Ban Trump" petition states that the UK "has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech" and argues that the rules must be "fairly applied to the rich as well as poor".  A counter-petition, also being debated although it has not reached the 100,000 signature mark, argues that foreign nationals should not be banned "for their opinions on domestic actions" and a ban would risk damaging US-UK relations given the possibility of a Trump victory in November's election.  Opening the debate in a crowded chamber, Mr Flynn said it would be wrong to ignore the ban petition, given that the "public was speaking with such a loud voice" and insisted the debate was not an attempt to "disrespect Americans or the American state".  He said some of those who signed the petition believed that Mr Trump's comments had incited acts of violence in the US.  Listing the names of some of those who had been banned by the UK authorities in recent years he said the risk of a ban would be that it would increase the publicity surrounding Mr Trump "100-fold".  Mr Trump's "prejudice" should be countered by "reasonableness, hospitality and courtesy", Mr Flynn told MPs. "We should not build him up by our attacks," he said.  "The great danger by attacking this one man is that we can fix on him a halo of victimhood," he said. "We give him the role of martyrdom which can seem to be an advantage among those who support him."  Tory MP Andrew Murrison said Mr Trump was a "ridiculous" figure but to ban someone who had a chance of becoming US President could be construed as an "almighty snub" to the US.  Fellow Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said the UK had invited despots to the UK in the past who had done "far, far worse than anything Donald Trump can dream of" and he warning against "shutting down an honest debate about immigration".  But, backing a ban, Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said Mr Trump's words "risks inflaming tensions between vulnerable communities" and those calling for this "poisonous and corrosive" man to be barred were speaking in "good conscience".  "I draw the line with freedom of speech when it actually imports violent ideology," she said.  "The legislation exists to protect the public and the people of Britain from individuals such as this... the same rules need to apply to Donald Trump."  Labour MP Jack Dromey: "I don't think Donald Trump should be allowed within 1,000 miles of our shores....Donald Trump is free to be a fool but he is not free to be a dangerous fool in Britain."  Labour MP Naz Shah: "I would give Donald Trump an open invitation to visit my constituency... I would invite him for a curry. I would welcome him, have a conversation with him and challenge him on his views."  Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh: "Like it or not, he is quite a contender to be the head of state of the most powerful country on the planet, a country which is a vital ally of ours. We have welcomed to the country Saudi and Chinese leaders, not to mention Mr Ceausescu, whose crimes are far worse than anything Mr Trump can dream up."  Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston: "I would argue that should Donald Trump be excluded from one of the United States' oldest allies, it would send a very clear message to the people of the US about what we feel about those who demonise an entire people for no other reason apart from their religion."  The SNP's Ms Ahmed-Sheikh said Mr Trump's comments made the UK an "uncomfortable place" for her and other Muslims to live in.  "The home secretary has explicitly excluded 84 people for hate speech. My view is that Donald Trump should be number 85."  The UK home secretary has the power to ban people from entering the country on grounds of national security, if they are thought likely to incite racial hatred or if they are deemed not to be "conducive to the public good".  Ahead of the debate, Trump International Links Scotland issued a statement saying MPs should be spending their time debating the problems facing the Scottish and UK economies.  "For the UK to consider banning someone who made a statement in America, about American borders during a US election campaign is ridiculous," said Sarah Malone, the company's executive vice president.  "Westminster is creating a dangerous precedent on this issue and is sending a terrible message to the world."	politics

Chief executive Simon Stevens told the Guardian newspaper he was proposing a 20% tax on all sugary drinks and foods in NHS cafes to be introduced by 2020.  He said the NHS's 1.3 million staff had a "responsibility" to lead by example, and urged MPs to take similar action.  David Cameron has said he would not rule out a national sugar tax.  How much sugar is hiding in your food?  Analysis: Can we trust the sugar industry?  It is expected the NHS levy, which would initially only apply to sugary drinks, could raise £20m-£40m a year, Mr Stevens said.  It is hoped the tax would discourage staff, patients and visitors from buying sugary items, while the money raised would be used to improve the health of the NHS's large workforce, he said.  It would be the first public body in Britain to impose a sugar tax.  The Welsh government and the Northern Ireland executive said there were no plans for a similar measure in their respective NHS facilities.  Mr Stevens said: "Because of the role that the NHS occupies in national life, all of us working in the NHS have a responsibility not just to support those who look after patients, but also to draw attention to and make the case for some of the wider changes that will actually improve the health of this country.  "It's not just the well-being of people in this country and our children. But it's also the sustainability of the NHS itself," he added.  Bosses would consult on introducing the tax, which would be gradually enforced as catering and hospital shop contracts come up for renewal over the next three to five years.  The NHS levy would be linked to the government's forthcoming national childhood obesity strategy.  The campaign group, Action on Sugar, welcomed the idea - saying it had been a long-time coming.  However, free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs said the idea was "ineffective, but also unfair".  Head of lifestyle economics Chris Snowdon said: "Taxing soft drinks, no matter where they are purchased, hits the poorest hardest and has never been shown to reduce obesity anywhere in the world.  The proposal comes days after David Cameron signalled that he was prepared to drop his opposition to a sugar tax. Number 10 previously said the prime minister "doesn't see a need for a tax on sugar".  Mr Cameron told journalists it would be better not to have to resort to new taxes but said that "what matters is we do make progress" on obesity.  In October a report by Public Health England recommended a tax of between 10 and 20% on high-sugar products as one of the measures needed to achieve a "meaningful" reduction in sugar consumption.  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has also campaigned for such a move, while a new study in the British Medical Journal said Mexico's sugary drinks tax led to a 12% reduction in sales.  Ian Wright of the Food and Drink Federation, said it was puzzling that Mr Stevens has chosen to pre-empt the launch of Government's comprehensive obesity strategy, by announcing plans for new taxes.  "Public Health England acknowledges that there is a lack of evidence about the long-term effectiveness of additional taxes on food and drink. We can only assume, therefore, that today's announcement is driven more by the need to raise money than by any wish to change behaviours."  Why is sugar so addictive?	health

The Alzheimer's Society said it had found "shocking" evidence of poor and variable care during its review.  The report, based on Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, found problems with falls, night-time discharges and readmissions, and said standards needed to improve urgently.  The Department of Health said the disease was a key priority.  One in four hospital beds is believed to be occupied by a person with dementia.  The Alzheimer's Society called for all hospitals to publish an annual statement of dementia care, to include information on satisfaction, falls, readmissions and staff training.  The charity received responses to their FOI request from half of the 163 hospital trusts in England; however, for some of the questions the figures were based on a fifth of trusts as not all hospitals could provide answers to all the questions.  The Alzheimer's Society also carried out a survey of dementia patients. It found examples of patients being treated with excessive force, not being given enough help with meals and drinks and being left in wet or soiled sheets.  Nine in 10 said hospitals were frightening and only 2% felt all staff understood the needs of people with dementia.  The charity described these findings as unacceptable and a sign that dementia patients were not getting the standard of care they should.  Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said: "In the worst cases, hospital care for people with dementia is like Russian roulette. People with dementia and their carers have no way of knowing what's going to happen to them when they are admitted.  "In many cases they are well looked after but, as our investigation shows, too often people with dementia fall and injure themselves, get discharged at night or are marooned in hospital despite their medical treatment having finished."  A Department of Health spokesman said the disease was a key priority and in recent years £50m had been spent on making hospitals and care homes more "dementia friendly", while 500,000 staff had received extra training.  "People with dementia and their carers deserve the very best support," he added.	health

The Labour leader told the Andrew Marr show that protecting defence jobs was his "first priority" and there were "options" for doing this while taking a lead in global nuclear "de-escalation".  Labour, which is split over the issue of renewing Trident, has said the idea is similar to one adopted by Japan.  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Labour would weaken the UK's defences.  In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Corbyn also said:  Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost £31bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer.  The Labour leader has been a longstanding opponent of Trident but some MPs and peers have threatened to resign if Labour reverses its decades-long support for the nuclear deterrent.  Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade.  Set aside the technicalities; Labour's Trident debate will be a test of political strength.  Ordering new submarines without nuclear weapons could make for a long term compromise, between Jeremy Corbyn and the unions at least.  But - as he makes clear - his views on those weapons aren't changing. Neither are those of his critics.  And - crucially - Parliament will make the main decision on Trident long before the end of Labour's policy review and its party conference.  So the leader, chief whip and shadow cabinet will have to decide whether or not to order Labour MPs to oppose the government.  All the while, ministers are confident of winning the Trident vote, whatever the opposition does.  And some Conservatives who think opposing nuclear weapons makes the opposition look weak are keen on a vote before the May elections.  Unite leader Len McCluskey has urged Mr Corbyn to give MPs a free vote on the issue, as happened over military action in Syria.  Mr Corbyn told the BBC that Trident was a relic from a "Cold War generation" and he did not believe David Cameron would ever contemplate using it.  Asked, in that case, what was the point of having at least one submarine on constant patrol, he said: "They don't have to have warheads on them."  He added: "If anyone uses a nuclear weapon it is catastrophic for the whole globe... There are options there."  Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.  The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.  The submarines carry up to 16 Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads, which can be directed at up to 12 different targets.  Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear deterrent  Union leaders have warned that scrapping Trident could devastate communities reliant on the defence industry and Mr Corbyn said he recognised the need to retain "amazing skills and technology".  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who backs the abolition of Trident, told a Unite conference in Clydebank that any decision to do so "must be matched by a programme of diversification and alternative employment".  "That is the position that the Scottish Parliament supported in November and that is the position that we [the SNP] will advocate."  Ms Thornberry said the idea of submarines equipped with conventional warheads, but with the potential to have a nuclear capability, was a posture adopted by Japan.  She told Sunday Politics that it was "certainly one option that is available to us and one thing that needs to be looked at".  But John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow in Furness - where the Vanguard fleet was built - said the idea was "implausible", adding: "Having a deterrent that has no capacity to deter is like having an army with broken rifles and no ammunition."  However, former minister and senior backbencher Keith Vaz said he had changed his mind on Trident.  "I think Jeremy Corbyn has persuaded me. He has made it very clear when he is prime minister that he is not going to be able to use these weapons, so what is the point in having them?" he told Russia Today.  Mr Corbyn, who outlined plans on Saturday to cap levels of executive pay and stop firms which don't pay a living wage from paying dividends, rejected suggestions he was talking only to people who agreed with him.  He said he wanted to "reach out to everybody", including Conservative voters.  He said he backed repealing legislation passed by the Thatcher government in the 1980s banning so-called secondary strike action, where unions walk out in sympathy with other workers already on strike.  Such action, he said, was "legal in other countries" and he asked whether he would legalise it, he replied, "Yes, of course."  The Conservatives said Mr Corbyn's pronouncements showed Labour were a threat to "the security of every working family".  "Labour would weaken Britain's defences by having a nuclear deterrent without any nuclear weapons, and would weaken our economy by changing the law to increase the number of disruptive strikes," said Mr Fallon.	politics

The US Presidential candidate must be treated the same as anyone else making anti-Muslim remarks, the ex-SNP leader said, and a ban would "do him good".  MPs will debate a petition on Monday urging action against Mr Trump after he called for Muslims to be denied entry to the US on counter-terrorism grounds.  Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Trump should be able to visit the UK and see the contribution made by Muslims.  The tycoon's call for a temporary ban on Muslims, which he made in response to the deadly shootings in San Bernardino in December, were criticised across the political spectrum in the US and Europe.  He caused further anger by claiming that areas of London and other parts of the UK have become so radicalised that they have become no-go areas for the police.  Despite the political backlash, Mr Trump is still leading several opinion polls in the race to be the Republican candidate for November's election ahead of the first primary contest next month.  Mr Trump, who owns the Turnberry golf course among other assets in Scotland, has threatened to cancel £700m of planned investment if he is blocked from returning to the UK.  But the former Scottish first minister, who once courted Mr Trump but whose relationship with him has deteriorated in recent months and who has been involved in a war of words with the tycoon, said he believed there were grounds for excluding him.  "What should happen is that the home secretary should consider Donald Trump's remarks in the same way as she consider the remarks of hundreds of other people and she should do it with exactly the same criteria.  "My view is that, yes, I would probably ban "The Donald" because it would do him some good. He wants to ban all Muslims from the US. I want to ban all Donald Trumps from Scotland."  The UK home secretary has the power to ban people from entering the UK on grounds of national security, if they are thought likely to incite racial hatred or if they are deemed not to be "conducive to the public good".  Theresa May has banned more than 200 people since 2010, according to figures published last year, although she has declined to comment on whether Mr Trump could be added to the list.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joined prime minister David Cameron in opposing a ban, telling the BBC that although Mr Trump's views were "weird and off-the-wall", he would benefit from seeing first-hand how Muslims were treated in the UK and their contribution to British society.  "I decided to invite Donald Trump on his visit to Britain to come with me to my constituency because he has problems with Mexicans and he has problems with Muslims," he told the Andrew Marr Show.  "As you know my wife is Mexican and my constituency is very, very multi-cultural so what I was going to do was go down to the mosque with him and let him talk to people there."  He added: "I don't think we should ban people from coming to Britain on that basis. I think he should come here and have a lesson in going to all our cities. Why can't he go to Leicester, Birmingham and Newcastle and see that we have great diversity in our society."  More than 573,000 have signed the petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK. MPs will debate the petition, and a counter-petition criticising a ban signed by more than 42,000 people for three hours on Monday, starting at 16.30 GMT.	politics

It was suggested to him, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, that the current action by junior doctors would be more effective if the ban was ended.  "Sympathy action is legal in most other countries, it should also be legal here," Mr Corbyn said.  The Tories said the remarks show Labour is a "threat" to economic security.  Asked if he would end the ban on secondary strike action - also known as solidarity action - brought in by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1990, Mr Corbyn said: "Yes, of course".  He added: "Nobody willingly goes on strike. They go on strike as an ultimate weapon... So let's look at the causes of people being upset rather than the symptoms."  Mr Corbyn also did not rule out allowing the return of flying pickets - where workers travels to support others' action - which were first used in the coal disputes of the 1970s.  He said: "It was merely people moving around showing support during a very difficult industrial dispute."  Referring to the walkout by junior doctors in their dispute with the government about a new contract, Mr Corbyn said they "would be better served if we had a health secretary who was prepared to get involved, meet them and look for a solution".  There were calls for the laws on secondary strikes to be repealed in 2005 while Labour was in power, amid action by baggage handlers at Heathrow Airport in support of sacked staff at the catering firm Gate Gourmet. However, the government then ruled out the prospect of lifting the ban.  The issue re-emerged three years later but then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there would be "no return" to past laws.	politics

But what if you want children? A project in Kenya is helping couples there have a family without risking their health.  John and his wife Josephine live a few hours north of Nairobi. Josephine is HIV positive, John is negative.  He says such situations are can be difficult. "I've known couples who have separated", he says.  There are 26,0000 couples in Kenya where one partner is positive and the other negative. Known as serodiscordant couples, they account for 44% of new HIV infections in the country. Despite this, 44% of these couples have had children together.  But the drive to have children is still very strong - in one recent study involving serodiscordant couples 17% of the women became pregnant.  Now a new drugs trial is giving a ray of hope. A new way of using the anti-HIV drugs - normally given to people who are HIV positive - could potentially mean couples could try and conceive risk-free.  The cocktail of drugs, known as PrEP is already being used for gay men in the UK and US.  Dr Nelly Mugo from the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi and a team from Washington University ran the trial.  "The Partners PrEP study took over 4,700 couples, one of whom had HIV, and one who didn't. The person who wasn't infected took PrEP over the course of 36 months.  "We found that having the drug in your system reduced the rate of transmission by over 90%.  "If the positive partner was also taking antiretroviral drugs, the risk of transmission would reduce to zero or close to zero"  In some communities social pressure to have children can be huge, with families of childless couples often struggling to understand why they haven't had children.  In a recent study couples described feeling helpless and vulnerable to HIV while trying to conceive.  Uninfected partners were relieved when they remained uninfected after unprotected sex, which for some reinforced a belief in divine protection.  Dr Mugo says: "Common motivations for child-bearing included fulfilling the couples' preferred family size, desire for biological children, maintaining partnership stability and, often most importantly, external pressure from society."  HIV is incurable because, once in your body, it hides in inaccessible places, creating reservoirs, which means it can never be flushed out.  The theory behind PrEP is that taking the antiretroviral drugs before becoming infected means they are already in the body.  But researchers have shown that if a non-infected person already has the PrEP drugs in their system when the virus enters their body it gets killed.  This means it doesn't have a chance to hide in reservoirs, and so its harder for that person to become infected.  "PrEP is the best thing that can happen for these couples" says Dr Mugo, because it could solve what she calls the "discordance dilemma".  "When you find out your partner is HIV positive it can lead to conflicting emotions," she adds. "But relationships and feelings and love are stronger than the virus.  "With many couples they want to stay together, but are unable to have normalised sexual relationships. PrEP has the potential to solve this problem."  The trial was a success. As of September 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people at substantial risk of HIV infection should be offered PrEP as an additional prevention choice, as part of comprehensive prevention.  The national health board in Kenya is now considering licensing the drugs for discordant couples around the country.	health

He said in a speech to a think tank too much profit from economic growth had gone to those at the top of society.  The Labour leader was explaining his strategy to tackle pay inequality and "institutionalise fairness" in Britain.  He later told the Unite union in Scotland the Tories wanted to "tip the scales further" in favour of bosses.  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Corbyn "seems committed on ripping apart our business sector in pursuit of an egalitarian fantasy". A Conservative Party spokesman called Labour a "clear threat to our economic security".  Addressing the left-of-centre Fabian Society, Mr Corbyn said: "Only profitable employers will be paying dividends; if they depend on cheap labour for those profits then I think there is a question over whether that is a business model to which we should be turning a blind eye."  CBI chief of staff Matthew Fell said: "The idea of politicians stepping into the relationship between a private company and its shareholders would be a significant intervention, and not one that we would support."  Almost six million workers in the UK are currently paid less than the living wage - an informal benchmark promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, which is currently £8.25 an hour and £9.40 in London.  The government has announced a compulsory National Living Wage for people over 25 starting at £7.20 an hour in April this year, with a target of reaching more than £9 an hour by 2020.  Mr Corbyn said imposing "pay ratios" between those at the top and those at the bottom of a company's pay scale could be another option for creating a fairer society.  He said: "A more equal society is not only fairer, it does better in terms of economic stability and wealth creation."  The Labour leader also used his speech to attack the Conservatives, accusing them of "running the state into the ground" for ideological reasons.  "Their concept of fairness is of a very different order to ours," he said. "Fairness for only a few is not fairness, but privilege."  In his address to Unite's Scottish conference in Glasgow, Mr Corbyn repeated his call, saying companies should "pay the living wage to the workers first and the dividend later on".  He also said a future Labour government would repeal the Trade Union Bill currently going through Parliament, and extend employees' rights.  Mr Corbyn repeated his promise to renationalise the railways, which he said would bring down fares.  And he said the way to cut energy bills for consumers and transition to carbon-free energy was to restore "democratic control" of the energy companies.  Seema Malhotra, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC Mr Corbyn was not announcing "something that is Labour policy" adding "it was an idea" to provoke debate.  Mr Corbyn had said party members and supporters would decide whether his proposals were worth adopting.  "Our... membership has doubled since that [general election] defeat in May; our party is in a process of regenerating - a difficult process of adjustment for us all at times, but a huge opportunity to breathe life into all sections of the party and draw on the collective wisdom of all."  BBC News politics reporter Matt Cole said the speech was a way for Mr Corbyn to regain the political initiative following the shadow cabinet reshuffle over which three of his front-bench team resigned.  He said the "most eye-catching plan", the proposals on dividends, received a warm welcome from Labour supporters happy to move on from what may have seemed like unending internal party rows.

The review, to be led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry, will feed into a wider review on the UK's global role that Mr Livingstone will chair.  Ms Thornberry said the defence element would be "based on the evidence" and take into account differing views.  She said she was aiming to publish an interim report by June.  This would enable Labour's National Policy Forum to consider policy on Trident prior to the party conference in September - at which party members could vote to overturn decades of support for nuclear weapons.  The BBC's Carole Walker said it had been assumed that Mr Livingstone would play a leading role in the review of Labour's policy on whether to renew Britain's nuclear weapons.  The former Mayor of London said he was "happy" with the part he was playing and said he and Ms Thornberry - who became defence spokeswoman in a reshuffle earlier this month - were in "complete agreement" on the issue.  Mr Livingstone and Ms Thornberry are opposed to the UK's nuclear weapon system as is Jeremy Corbyn but many Labour MPs support it.  Labour's official policy since the late 1980s has been to keep Trident but supporters of Mr Corbyn want to change it at the party conference later this year, arguing that weapons will never be used and its multibillion pound cost cannot be justified.  The Labour leader has promised to give party members a say over the decision.  However, this could prompt a backlash from senior MPs - including several members of the shadow cabinet - who believe a nuclear deterrent is essential to the UK's national security and place in the world.  Mr Livingstone's involvement in the process has provoked criticism from some Labour MPs as he has been highly critical of supporters of Trident in the party and has not held elected office since stepping down as Mayor of London in 2008.  Setting out the terms of reference for the review, Ms Thornberry said it would examine the "whole range of defence challenges", not merely Trident, and how best to respond to the threats facing the British people.  It is expected there will be public meetings and seminars as part of the efforts to gather evidence from academics, military personnel, families, party members and other interested parties.  Read more: A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement  "This will be a comprehensive review of Britain's defence challenges and options for the 21st century," she said. "It will be open, transparent and inclusive, and its conclusions will be based on the evidence.  "At every stage of the process, we will give full scope to the wide range of views on this subject in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust."  While she would approach the review with an "open mind," she said she was "extremely sceptical" about the grounds for retaining Trident and would "not be afraid to ask some really difficult questions".  She insisted the review "would take as long as it takes" but that, if need be, would publish interim findings to "feed" into discussions at the National Policy Forum, expected to take place in July.  The BBC's political correspondent Carole Walker said there was no intention to prioritise or separate Trident policy from the wider defence review.  Ms Thornberry's review of the party's defence policy will feed into a wider review of Labour's foreign policy on which Mr Livingstone will be co-convenor along with the shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn. Work has yet to start on the wider policy review on Britain in the World.  MPs will vote at some point this year on whether to proceed with the building of a new generation of Vanguard nuclear submarines, to replace the existing fleet which will become obsolete by the end of the 2020s.  Former Labour defence minister, Lord West, said he would quit the party if it decided not to support Trident, telling Daily Politics the "British public believe in the deterrent" and a policy of unilateralism would be "disastrous".  And the head of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said it would be making a "very strong case" to Labour about the role Trident played in supporting jobs in communities across the UK.  "Our members will be reassured by the scope and calendar of this review because it is evidently designed to ensure that all voices are heard in this important process," he said.	politics

It argues people underestimate the time it takes to walk off the calories in a coffee or muffin, for example.  Activity symbols on packs would prompt consumers to choose healthier options or exercise more, it believes.  The food and drink industry said the idea was worth exploring.  A policy paper from the RSPH says the most common cause of obesity is consuming more calories than are burned off - and those taking lots of exercise are more likely to lose weight.  However, research shows that some consumers find current labels on the front of products confusing because of information overload.  They also spend just six seconds looking at food before buying it.  This means the information on the front of packs should be easy to understand and calorie information should be presented in a clear way, the paper said.  The RSPH says pictorial icons on the front of packs, as well as existing information, would be a good idea.  These pictures would show how much exercise is required to walk or run off the calories contained in the product.  The policy paper contains a number of examples:  The labelling would also remind the public of the importance of being physically active, which is known to boost mood, energy levels and reduce stress and depression.  A survey of 2,000 adults by RSPH found that more than 60% of people would support the introduction of "activity equivalent calorie labelling".  More than half said it would encourage them to choose healthier products, eat smaller portions or do more physical exercise.  Men should consume around 2,500 calories and women 2,000 calories on average each day to maintain a healthy weight, the paper says.  Two-thirds of adults in the UK are currently overweight or obese.  Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: "Although nutritional information provided on food and drink packaging has improved, it is evident that it isn't working as well as it could to support the public in making healthy choices.  "Activity equivalent calorie labelling provides a simple means of making the calories contained within food and drink more relatable to people's everyday lives, while also gently reminding consumers of the need to maintain active lifestyles and a healthy weight."  A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation said activity equivalent information was "an interesting concept" which was worth exploring.  "As an industry, we are looking at what more we can do to help people use the existing nutrition information provided to understand how different foods and drinks fit within a healthy lifestyle.  "We support RSPH's call for further research into whether activity equivalent calorie labelling could be an effective way of encouraging consumers to use labels."  The FDF said EU rules which dictate what companies are allowed to put on their food labels would need to be considered in any proposals.	health

He says a government survey is needed to track the whereabouts of those dropping off the roll.  But the Department of Work and Pensions says the claims have "no basis".  About 1.5 million people leave the welfare system each year, but it is unclear how many are left without work or benefit payments, according to Mr Field, who chairs the influential Commons Work and Pensions select committee.  Some may be in jail or have moved abroad, while others are people on benefits who have been hit by sanctions and dropped out of the system, a report co-authored by Mr Field and Andrew Forsey, head of the MP's parliamentary office, found.  Sanctions are imposed when claimants fail to comply with welfare conditions imposed by the government.  The report, published by think tank Civitas, calls for ministers to carry out an urgent survey to find out what happens to claimants expelled from the welfare rolls who appear not to find work.  It welcomes plans to trial a "yellow card" early warning system for claimants facing sanction because they are deemed not to have done enough to find work - and calls for Jobcentre Plus staff to be given powers to issue non-financial sanctions.  It also recommends the Department for Work and Pensions trials a "grace period" for vulnerable claimants that eases the rules at times when they are facing transition or acute difficulty.  Mr Field and Mr Forsey said: "The number of sanctions was halved in the year leading up to the 2015 election, but it still remained at half a million.  "Sanctions are therefore being applied at a scale unknown since the Second World War, and the operation of sanctions on this scale makes for a most significant change in the social security system as it has existed in the post-war period.  "A number of people - we know not how large a number - are being totally disconnected from both work and welfare, and risk being exposed to destitution.  "Justice calls for a major survey of what happens to the hundreds of thousands of people thrown off the welfare rolls each year through the sanctioning process.  "It is unacceptable, not only for this government, but for its predecessor and those who will follow, to take away benefit from a mass of people each year and not trouble themselves with how this army of people survive.  "For that is what is happening under the government's sanctions policy. The ability to track the well-being of the whole population is now a part of being a grown up government, let alone a 'One Nation' government."  But a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "There is no basis to these claims.  "People leave the benefits system for many reasons, including when they go to work - which is good news.  "It's extremely unlikely anyone would leave the benefit system because of a sanction. The truth is we have record employment and we spend £80bn supporting millions of people who are unemployed or on low incomes."  In 1997, Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Mr Field the task of "thinking the unthinkable" as a welfare reform minister, but he later resigned from government.  Following the 2010 general election, he led an independent review into UK poverty for the coalition government.  Last year Mr Field co-chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger in the UK.	politics

At present, a patient's body weight is the main factor in deciding the dose.  But a University of Cambridge study indicated people with high levels of brain connectivity or "chatter" needed a larger dose to put them under.  And this could help doctors work out exactly the amount of anaesthetic a patient requires to become unconscious.  The study, published in PLOS Computational Biology, looked at how the brain's electric signals changed in 20 healthy volunteers given a common anaesthetic called propofol.  They were then asked to press different buttons when they heard different sounds.  After reaching the maximum dose, some were still pressing buttons, while others were unconscious.  The "chatter" or connectivity between areas of the brain was much more pronounced in those who were still conscious.  And when the research team looked at brain activity when the participants were awake, using readings from an electroencephalogram (EEG), they found similar differences.  Lead study author Dr Srivas Chennu, from the University of Cambridge department of clinical neurosciences, said: "The greater the network activity at the start, the more anaesthetic they are likely to need to put them under."  He said brain "chatter" was not a measure of brain power.  "It varies from day to day as well as from person to person," he said.  "It can be related to the amount of coffee you've drunk or how much sleep you've had."  The research was still in its early stages, he added.  Dr Richard Marks, vice-president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, said: "It's actually very difficult to tell when a patient is asleep or not.  "We need something that is reliable, specific and easy-to-use to help us."  Administering too much anaesthetic could cause side-effects, including heart attacks and strokes, he added.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35311578	Safer Down's test backed for NHS use	Pregnant women in the UK should soon get a safer and more accurate test for Down's syndrome on the NHS, to reduce the risk of miscarriage.  The UK National Screening Committee has backed the test, saying it would reduce anxiety for expectant mothers.  The move would prevent thousands of invasive procedures, in which one in every 200 women loses her baby.  The test analyses tiny fragments of the baby's DNA that end up in the mother's blood, to look for abnormalities.  Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and characteristic physical features.  About 775 babies are born with the condition each year in England and Wales, according to the NHS  The NHS offers screening to women 11 to 14 weeks into their pregnancy.  At the moment, an ultrasound scan, the mother's age and other factors such as smoking are combined to assess the likelihood of a baby having Down's.  Anyone with a greater than one-in-150 chance of having a baby with Down's is offered an amniocentesis, in which a needle is used to extract a sample of amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus.  But it is a risky procedure, which will give a negative result in the overwhelming majority of cases.  The new non-invasive prenatal blood test (NIPT) will be offered to women instead.  Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, and it is this extra DNA from the baby that the test spots in the mother's blood.  If the test is positive, doctors will still recommend an amniocentesis, but the invasive procedure will become unnecessary for the majority of women.  The UK National Screening Committee, which advised health authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, has recommended non-invasive pre-natal testing is introduced.  Dr Anne Mackie, the director of programmes at the UK National Screening Committee, told the BBC News website: "I think it has the potential to make a great deal of difference.  "It will give more accurate results and reduce anxiety in a significant number of people."  The new screening plan will be rolled out gradually as it is still uncertain how popular the test will be among women and how effective it will be for other conditions such as Edwards' and Patau's syndromes.  But estimates suggest between 3,000 and 5,000 amniocenteses each year will no longer be necessary.  Great Ormond Street Hospital conducted trials to assess how non-invasive prenatal testing could be used on the NHS.  It indicated many women who would have refused the amniocentesis chose to have the safer test.  Prof Lyn Chitty, who led those trials, told the BBC: "I'm very pleased that they've made the decision to introduce it into NHS maternity care for all women, we know many are going to the private sector for it at the moment.  "For those getting reassurance, it's great and they can enjoy the rest of their pregnancy.  "For those with a positive diagnosis, we have to put measures in place to support them."  She said the testing "might" lead to an increase in abortions but her study showed "many are using it to prepare for the birth of a baby with Down's syndrome".  The National Screening Committee says it is aware there may be an impact on abortion, but the voluntary test was there to give women information and it was up to them what happened next.  Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has called for the correct training of NHS staff in the "communication and counselling expectant parents" in the implications of the results.  Prof Baskaran Thilaganathan, from St George's Hospital in London, which is already offering the test, said the non-invasive option would make a "massive difference to patients".  He said: "Women can now have this DNA blood test, which is £200 cheaper than an amniocentesis and has no risk of miscarriage  "It's fairly self-evident that the cheap and safer test is the way forward."	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35304105	Organ donations vetoed by hundreds of bereaved families	Bereaved families have blocked the organ donation of 547 UK registered donors since 2010 - about one in seven cases, figures show.  NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) says it will no longer seek the consent of families formally, to make such "overrides" more exceptional.  Instead, they will be given a leaflet explaining consent - or authorisation in Scotland - rests with the deceased.  Families can still veto that consent but must provide reasons in writing.  NHSBT expects the change to lead to a 9% rise in donors.  It said the 547 blocked donors would have provided organs for 1,200 of the 6,578 patients currently waiting for transplants.  Last month, the system in Wales changed to "presumed consent", under which people are deemed to be potential donors unless they have specifically opted out.  NHSBT head Sally Johnson, said: "We are taking a tougher approach - but also a more honest approach.  "My nurses are speaking for the person who has died. People who join the register want and expect to become organ donors.  "We do not want to let them down."  She added: "We have every sympathy for families - and of course we do not want to make their grief worse.  "We think this will make what is a hugely distressing day easier for them, by reducing the burden on them.  "The principle that the individual affected is the one who consents applies throughout medicine, and it is not different because someone has died."  Specialist nurse James Hardie, from St Mary's Hospital in London, said: "Families sometimes override their relative's wishes because they perhaps did not know that person was on the register.  "They find it distressing that they did not know their loved one as well as they thought."  But he added: "The consequence of refusal is that people die as a result - that is the unfortunate reality of the situation.  "If somebody refuses the opportunity for their loved one to become an organ donor, somebody potentially goes without a transplant."  The British Medical Association said families should be strongly encouraged to respect the views of the deceased.  But it said that in the small number of cases where they had such strong and sustained opposition it was likely to cause them severe distress, donation might be inappropriate.	health

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer - with the worst 10-year survival rate. Most patients are told they may have less than a year to live.  The bank will collect samples from six hospitals in England and Wales, with the aim of eventually providing better treatments and earlier diagnosis.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35263463	'New research hope' from pancreatic-cancer tissue bank	Medical researchers hope a new bank storing tissue from patients will give them a clearer insight into pancreatic cancer.  This complex illness has the worst 10-year survival rate of any cancer, with most patients being told they may have less than a year to live.  The bank will collect samples from six hospitals in England and Wales.  The charity that funded it hopes there will eventually be better treatments and earlier diagnosis.  There are 8,875 cases of pancreatic cancer a year in the UK, with almost the same number of people dying from it annually.  Just 1% of sufferers are alive 10 years after diagnosis - a survival rate that is unchanged in 40 years.  Researchers now hope they will be able to improve this dismal picture.  Barts Cancer Institute has praised the "vision and determination" of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund (PCRF), which raised £2m to fund the bank.  Samples will be collected from consenting patients at six hospitals - in Swansea, Leicester, Oxford and Southampton and Barts and the Royal Free in London.  The tissue will help scientists study genetic changes in the cancerous cells.  The bank will store actual tumour samples - as well as blood, saliva and urine in which proteins indicating cancer can be found - from about 1,000 patients a year.  The aim is to be able to detect cases more quickly.  Prof Hemant Kocher, from Barts Cancer Institute, told me: "Surgery is possible in only about 10-15% of patients with pancreas cancer at the moment.  "We hope this tissue bank will help us develop diagnostic tests so that more patients can have surgery.  "If diagnosed early enough, they can have surgery.  "It is about the only thing that can give a long-term cure for these patients.  "Pancreatic cancer is a complex disease, with a number of alterations in the cancer cells and the cells surrounding the cancer.  "And it's a deep-seated organ, so tissue isn't always available.  "This means research has really been set back."  The PCRF's founder, Maggie Blanks, said: "A nationally co-ordinated tissue bank will not only ensure that more samples become available to researchers, but that these are quality controlled to provide a much better basis for the very best research to be carried out."  Carol Hayes, from Basildon, was among the first patients to donate tissue to the bank, during a gruelling seven-hour operation last year.  So far, she is clear of pancreatic cancer, though she still needs six-monthly check-ups.  Ms Hayes said: "It was the only thing I could give back to say thank you and to try and help, because I was borderline lucky.  "Maybe another couple of months down the line, I wouldn't have been able to have the op.  "They said I was borderline, and so many with pancreatic cancer aren't.  "I saw my enemy, the tumour, on a scan.  "It's like I put it in a box and handed it over - so someone could do good with it."  Adrian Morrish's wife, Noreen, died from pancreatic cancer within a year of being diagnosed, at a time when they should have been planning their golden wedding anniversary.  He said: "It was a terrible period because I was watching somebody who'd had a very active life go downhill very fast.  "It was an appalling year.  "It was a nightmare when the chemotherapy stopped working.  "It was extremely hard for all the family - they lost their mother and grandmother.  "I realise now what an appalling disease it is, with a minimal survival rate.  "That's why it's so important research projects continue."	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35314824	Captain Kirk actor William Shatner backs Commons space debate	Star Trek actor William Shatner endorsed a House of Commons debate by MPs on space exploration.  The actor, who played Captain Kirk in the science fiction series, wrote a message of support for the discussion.  SNP MP Phillippa Whitford read out the message from Mr Shatner at the start of the debate.  Mr Shatner was quoted as saying: "Space is one of the last known frontiers, mostly untouched by mankind in his politics."  "In opening a debate on this subject, it is is my hope that you take the tenets of Star Trek's prime directive to universally and peacefully share in the exploration of it. I wish you all a wonderful debate. My best, Bill."  The debate also received a message of support on Twitter from another Star Trek actor, George Takei, who played USS Enterprise helmsman Sulu.  Ms Whitford told the Commons the space industry was "a real industry, a multi-billion pound industry". She called on ministers "to boldly go where no minister has gone before". She believed in the past the UK had shied away saying "space is for other people, the big boys - Russia, China, US but not us".  Ms Whitford also remarked that British astronaut Tim Peake was not the first British astronaut to go to space, that honour had already gone to Helen Sharman who went to space in 1991.  The debate came just one day ahead of Tim Peake's space walk and in response to the government publishing their national space policy. The policy set out the UK's aims to become "the European hub for commercial spaceflight and related space sector technologies" in order to create new jobs, businesses and a better understanding of space. Most MPs who attended were SNP members, with few MPs from others parties taking part.  The MPs debated where a spaceport could be based in the UK, with Cornwall, and areas of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all coming out as contenders.  Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, elicited calls of "shame" from other MPs after admitting he had not watched the early Star Wars movies. He said in the past he had objected to spending money on vanity projects rather than working to improve social justice but believed a thriving space industry could bring significant benefits to the UK population.  Carol Monaghan, MP for Glasgow North West, said she had been asked if the debate was "really that important". She said she believed it was "crucial" as the space and defence industries were the only ones that really pushed innovation, producing spin off technologies and products such as prosthetic limbs, foam mattresses and artificial satellites.  Yvonne Fovargue, shadow business, innovation and skills minister, welcomed the debate but criticised the "ad hoc" nature of government funding which she said hindered strategic planning. She highlighted how space industry research had brought benefits to disaster relief, medicine and transport.  The debate ended with Business Minister George Freeman calling the UK space sector "an undoubted and massive success story". He said the government's national space policy demonstrated a long term commitment to the industry, but he said he wouldn't "pre-empt" the process of selecting a spaceport adding it would be done "fairly" and "openly".	politics

There are claims the report, which was completed in November, has been suppressed by the party because it would undermine Jeremy Corbyn.  But the BBC's Iain Watson, who has been briefed on its contents, says it does not blame "left wing" policies.  He said the party was likely to publish the report, which was written by Margaret Beckett, on Tuesday.  More than 500 people have signed a petition calling for it to be released.  Commissioning the report last May, interim Labour leader Harriet Harman said the party needed a "forensic, honest examination of where it went wrong" in order to regain the trust of the British public.  It will be discussed by a sub committee of Labour's National Executive next week.  In the meantime, I have spoken to a senior Labour source who has seen the report and I have - verbatim - its key findings.  The report sets out four reasons why the party lost the election, gleaned from polling and doorstep conversations:  The report reads like it is written by committee - the left are likely to point to some of its finding a as a kind of endorsement, mainstream MPs will highlight others  The report provides some solace for Corbynistas.  It says: "Some of the 'left-wing policies' were the most popular" (eg mansions tax) and "individual policies polled well - the issue was the lack of a consistent, cohesive narrative".  It also says some voters on the left wouldn't have voted for Labour if it had been any more right wing  But - on the other hand - it says the party failed to win sufficient votes from the Lib Dems in the right parts of the country, and did better in seats which Labour already held, and "we failed to connect with demographic groups who are seen as in the centre" of British politics.  Beckett's report more or less absolves the party officials who undertook the "ground war" in the run up to May's general election but suggests the party targeted too many seats - 106. The Conservatives attacked in only 50 and defended a further 50. Labour devoted few resources to seats where it was vulnerable.  Less spin, and getting the shadow cabinet to hold meetings outside London are among the recommendations, as well as identifying the need to have a "simple seamless narrative".  But Jeremy Corbyn might some of the report harder to swallow - it calls for a stronger defence of Labour's record in government - ie New Labour's record ("we should be proud of our record of major social change") and that the party should point out how "it paid down debt" before the financial crash.  And it says "we must take the global crash myth head on which dogged us through the last Parliament".  The report also suggests working more closely with business and gives some credence to the criticism that the party wasn't seen as being sufficiently in favour of individual aspiration.  A Labour spokesman said: "The formal process of considering the Learning the Lessons report is in its final stages and will conclude next week when it is presented to the relevant committee of the NEC. The Labour Party will then make the report public."	politics

Ambulances, the 111 phone service and cancer services all missed key targets.  And A&Es only managed to see 91.4% of patients in four hours - the worst performance in November since record-keeping began in 2010.  Meanwhile, the six-week target for diagnostic tests to be done was missed. It is now two years since it was last met.  Significant problems were also being experienced by hospitals in discharging some patients. There were over 153,000 days of delays, the second highest on record. Delays are experienced when there are not the community services available to care for vulnerable patients who are medically fit to leave hospital.  But hospitals did manage to hit their 18-week waiting time target for routine operations, such as hip and knee replacements.  Hospitals have been struggling with many of these targets for the past year or so - and similar challenges are being experienced by the health systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

And he added: "We continue to treat more than nine out of 10 A&E patients within four hours, probably the best performance of any major western country."  But Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: "These new figures are particularly worrying given that they only cover November, when the weather was exceptionally mild and winter had not even properly begun - the fact that there have been such dips in performance so early in the season does not leave the health service in a good position to cope with the rest of winter."	health

She said elections in May would be a "big first test" for the party as they face the London mayoral, Scottish, Welsh and English local elections.  The party had "turned left", she said, away from a centre-left position which she said had been "most effective".  Her comments come as Labour's membership has reportedly soared.  Baroness Jowell, a former minister in both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments, told BBC London's Vanessa Feltz radio show that Jeremy Corbyn "carried a tide" with an "extraordinary level" of "enthusiastic support" from hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members.  However, she questioned whether ordinary people, not part of the party, would vote for its policies, she said: "Is its offer, policy offer, one which people who are not members of the Labour Party want to vote for because they feel it will meet their needs?"  She said: "Will the Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party actually become a party of government?"  "You can have a party which is a movement which satisfies its members, enthuses its members and engages its members, but the role of a great political party like the Labour Party is to become a party of government," she said.  Asked whether she thought the Labour Party could become a party of government she replied "I don't know yet, we're four years away" from the general election.  She said elections in May would be "the moment at which the new Labour Party is tested".  During Labour's London mayoral candidate contest she ran against Sadiq Khan, who won.  She said she "gave it everything I could" and "couldn't have fought a better campaign" adding "I didn't win because the Labour Party turned left".

The British Medical Association (BMA) and the government are to begin two days of talks at 10:00 GMT, the conciliation service Acas said.  The dispute is over weekend pay, career progression, and fears of overworking.  A 48-hour walkout will start on 26 January if no agreement is found.  Junior doctors returned to work at 08:00 GMT on Wednesday following the end of their first 24-hour walkout, which led to the cancellation of about 3,300 operations.  Two further strikes are planned, the second of which - on 10 February - would involve a refusal to take part in emergency care.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt condemned the first strike as "wholly unnecessary".  What is the junior doctors row about?  Ministers argue the government's new contract will improve patient care at the weekend, but the doctors' union says the impact on safety would be unacceptable.  BMA council chairman Dr Mark Porter said there was "not just one remaining issue" regarding disagreement over weekend pay.  He said: "There are some serious issues about patient safety and recognition of junior doctors' contributions that need to be sorted here."  The government's new head negotiator, Sir David Dalton, pledged to "engage with the BMA team directly and listen to their outstanding concerns".  However, Norman Smith, the BBC's assistant political editor, said government sources were "adamant" that if no deal was reached then its new contract would be "imposed" on junior doctors.  "This could begin as early as the summer for new doctors joining the NHS and would then be rolled out among the existing 50,000 junior doctors," our correspondent said.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35301242	Giving healthy gay men HIV drugs 'could help reverse epidemic'	Giving daily HIV drugs to healthy gay men has huge potential to help reverse the epidemic, say scientists.  The medication prevents new infections by killing the virus before it has a chance to take hold in the body.  Calculations, published in the Lancet, indicate giving the drugs to the most at-risk men could cut new infections by more than 40% in the UK.  Experts said the approach was of "huge benefit" to at-risk men and should be adopted.  Men who have sex with men are at high risk of contracting HIV.  In London, one in eight gay men has HIV, while the proportion in the rest of the UK is one in 26.  While condoms are an effective barrier to HIV transmission, messages to use them are often ignored.  Last year, a UK test on 500 men assessed the impact of an alternative approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep).  It indicated one case of HIV could be stopped for every 13 men given anti-HIV drugs for a year.  Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of introducing such a treatment across the UK.  They estimated there would be 16,955 new cases of HIV in gay men by 2020.  But giving Prep to the most sexually active 25% of gay men would prevent 7,399 infections (44%).  Dr Narat Punyacharoensin, one of the researchers, said a focus on regular HIV tests and condom use "have been falling short".  He told the BBC News website: "Prep has a great potential to achieve a level of prevention that could never be achieved by all other HIV interventions."  He said the cost-effectiveness still needed to be determined, but "pre-exposure prophylaxis offers a major opportunity to curb new infections and could help reverse the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in the UK".  Concerns had been raised that men given the drug would adopt riskier behaviours including stopping using condoms.  But the test on 500 men, which concluded last year, found no difference in levels of other sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia.  Prof Sheena McCormack, who led that study at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, told the BBC: "[It] demonstrated a huge benefit from adding Prep to the existing risk-reduction package for men who have sex with men.  "This publication endorses the impressive longer term impact that Prep could have on the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in this country, and hopefully will guide NHS England towards a favourable decision."  Dr Michael Brady, the medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "This study is really important as it demonstrates that, in a relatively short space of time, Prep could have a dramatic impact on reducing HIV transmissions."  The NHS is evaluating whether Prep should be offered.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35308129	'Not enough Tories' in general election opinion polls	The failure of opinion pollsters to predict the outcome of May's general election may have been because Conservative voters are harder to track down, a report suggests.  The disparity between forecasts and the eventual Conservative majority has been blamed on "shy Tory" voters or a late swing to David Cameron's party.  His report said "more time and effort" was needed to find Conservative voters.  Pre-election polls had suggested the result was too close to call, but the Conservatives went on to win an absolute majority, with 331 seats.  Prof Curtice, who wrote the report for research agency NatCen, suggested polling difficulties arose "primarily because [pollsters] interviewed too many Labour supporters and not enough Conservatives".  NatCen interviewed 4,238 people between July and November last year for its British Social Attitudes Survey.  It said it had made "repeated efforts" over the four months to make contact with the people it had selected to interview - and among those it was able to contact most easily, Labour had a six-point lead.  However, among the harder-to-contact group, who took between three and six calls to track down, the Conservatives were 11 points ahead.  "Polls are conducted over just two or three days, which means they are more likely to interview those who are contacted most easily, either over the internet or via their phone," the report said.  The report rejected the "shy Tories" argument, which suggests Conservatives are less willing to declare their voting intentions when asked.  It said even when polling companies returned to respondents and asked how they had voted, they still put Labour and the Tories neck and neck.  But the British Social Attitudes survey put the Conservatives 6.1 points ahead of Labour, close to the actual election margin of 6.6 points.  Polling companies use a complex method to attempt to make their surveys representative, including weighting the responses to match the UK's demographic profile.  The report said its random sampling method was more representative.  Prof Curtice added: "A key lesson of the difficulties faced by the polls in the 2015 general election is that surveys not only need to ask the right questions but also the right people."  An investigation by the British Polling Council into the polling failures ahead of May's general election is due to be published later this month.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35306094	Labour: Lords curbs 'stifle debate'	Labour has accused the government of trying to "stifle debate" by removing peers' power to veto some draft laws.  Shadow Lords leader Baroness Smith said the move was a "massive over-reaction" to the government's defeat over tax credit changes last year.  She was speaking as peers debated the proposals put forward by Conservative Lord Strathclyde.  The Tory peer said Lords were actually being given a new "very practical" power they had never had before.  He led a review launched by David Cameron into the powers of the House of Lords after they blocked plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers.  The cuts were later shelved in the Autumn Statement.  The review recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords had over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send the secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to "think again".  They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.  Lord Strathclyde told a packed Upper House this new procedure would be the "ping without the pong" referring to legislation that goes back and forth between the House of Commons and Lords until both agree, commonly known as ping-ponging.  But Baroness Smith said it was "an unnecessary solution to a fictitious problem".  "The reality is that we seldom use our powers to their limits," she said.  "But that doesn't mean they shouldn't exist."  Unlike in the Commons, the Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Lords.  Making his maiden speech in the House of Lords, former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling said he understood the frustration of being a government minister.  George Osborne should have been grateful to peers for bringing about the reversal, he said, recalling the former Labour government's much-criticised abolition of the 10p rate of income tax.  He said the tax credit changes should have been introduced as primary legislation in the first place, which would have allowed the Lords to scrutinise them.  "I am increasingly concerned about the amount of constitutional change taking place in this country on a piecemeal basis," he added.  In recent years, Lord Strathclyde said the House of Lords had developed a "lesser understanding of the implications of what happens when we use our powers too aggressively" and enjoyed "unfettered powers" to veto secondary legislation.  Under the proposed model, he said: "We have a conversation between the two Houses but they (the Commons) have the final say."  It was right for the Lords to have a new procedure "to do what we do best, which is to ask the Commons to think again", he added.	politics

The body which regulates fertility research is to consider the first application in the UK to genetically modify human embryos.

The home secretary said she did not want to "go down the route of giving information about the sort of data sets that are being acquired".  She was speaking to the draft Investigatory Powers Bill committee.  It was revealed last year that GCHQ is downloading large amounts of personal data to aid its investigations.  It could include the personal details of "a large number of individuals, the majority of whom will not be of any interest to the security and intelligence agencies", according the draft bill.  The information from these "bulk personal data sets," which could include everything from the electoral register, supermarket loyalty schemes or bank records, is then analysed to enable investigators to "join the dots".  The practice is covered by old legislation and has never been debated by MPs.  Theresa May is promising new safeguards over the use of the powers, including six-month warrants to access data, and judicial oversight.  She said the security minister, John Hayes, had written to the committee of MPs and peers scrutinising the draft bill= to give the reasons why the government did not want to reveal the kinds of data investigators were accessing.  She insisted the practice - and the sweeping up by the security services of large quantities of internet traffic passing through the UK - did not amount to "mass surveillance" as civil liberties campaigners claim.  "The UK does not undertake mass surveillance," she told the committee.  The government's anti-terror legislation watchdog David Anderson is set to warn in a report that Ms May needs to come out and make the case to MPs and the public for the bulk collection of data.  If the government does not do this, it risks the practice being outlawed by the European Court of Justice, he is set to warn.	politics

Mr Cameron this week announced plans to regenerate 100 estates with some to be demolished.  But at PMQs Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said council tenants and Right-to-Buy purchasers would be "forced away".  The PM called Mr Corbyn a "small-c conservative" who wanted people to stay "stuck" in council estates.  The Labour leader said Mr Cameron had not "thought this thing through very carefully", pointing out that the estates bulldozed would include people who had bought their homes under the Conservatives' flagship Right-to-Buy policy.  He asked: "Will those people, the leaseholders, will they be guaranteed homes on those rebuilt estates that you are proposing to do?"  The PM said local councils and residents would be involved in the process which would "make sure that tenants get good homes, make sure homeowners get rehoused in new houses".  Pressed afterwards about the demolition plans on the BBC's Daily Politics, Conservative security minister John Hayes said the details of the redevelopment policy had not been announced but he was confident people would be offered "decent" alternative accommodation while construction work was taking place.  The leaders' clash came as the government's Housing Bill makes its way through Parliament. The legislation offers the Right-to-Buy for housing association tenants and also covers so-called "starter homes" which are aimed at first-time buyers.  Mr Corbyn said these homes would be unaffordable to people on the new National Living Wages living in 98% of council areas.  Rather than building more affordable homes, the government was "branding more homes as affordable", he added.  Mr Cameron said he and the Labour leader both owned their own homes, asking: "Why won't we let those 1.3 million (housing association tenants) own their homes?"  With his questions, Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, called for the return of a post-study work visa for foreign students, saying business and colleges in Scotland supported the move.  The PM said such a visa would effectively tell foreign students "it's okay to stay with a less than graduate job".  He told MPs: "We don't need the world's brightest and best to come here to study and then to do menial labour jobs, which actually that's not what our immigration system is for."  Jeremy Corbyn stuck to one broad subject - housing - for each of his allocated questions, surprising pundits by avoiding the junior doctors' strike.  He introduced two members of the public - Daryl on whether tenants would be offered replacement housing in the same areas, and Linda, who was worried about her tenancy if she downsizes when she gets older.  The atmosphere in the Commons was noticeably rowdier than some of the Labour leader's early appearances, when Mr Corbyn called for a different approach reflecting his "new politics".  The prime minister managed a dig about Labour's drawn-out reshuffle, which he said was "still going on", and rounded off his answers by claiming Mr Corbyn "does not believe in Britain".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35301298	Ruth Davidson: The 'tough old bird' of Tory Scotland	In May, Scotland goes to the polls to elect the Scottish Parliament. Could this be the moment for a Tory resurgence? John Sweeney met Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson for BBC Newsnight.  She is Tory, openly gay, Christian, likes a drink and, as a kick-boxer and ex-squaddie, can kill you. What's not to like? In the flesh, Ruth Davidson, 37, is a firkin of fun, speaks with a machine-gun delivery and can hold her own. And then some.  On the top of a knobbly hill across the way from Arthur's Seat, overlooking Holyrood in Edinburgh, I put to her my killer line: "If this was a Scottish gangster movie, you'd be wearing concrete boots."  "I'm not entirely sure what gangster movies you watch," she says. "But I think it's fair to say that the Scottish Conservatives have underperformed in recent years - particularly at that critical juncture in 1997. We got a lot of things wrong. We just had a wipeout."  As she spoke, Davidson gave me a sunny, easygoing smile with a hint of steel. Davidson needs to be uber-tough because bare knuckles and Scottish politics go together like horse and carriage.  Here, the simple fact of which nation we're in is disputed - and the polls suggest that Davidson, as a committed Unionist, could be on tricky ground. The Tories are hovering around 15%, behind Labour - and very far behind the Scottish National Party which is currently tipped, come May, to bag one in two votes.  Scottish political analyst David Torrance suggests that hard political fact is unlikely to change any time soon. He postulates that politics north of the border is "historically hegemonic". In the 19th Century, Scotland was broadly Liberal; in the 20th, Labour; in the 21st; Scottish Nationalist.  But the Tories used to do well in whole swathes of Scotland. They now repeatedly come third or fourth. One reason, according to some analysts, is the legacy of the hated poll tax and its architect, Mrs Thatcher - the great she-devil of Scottish nationalism. Did Davidson get bored with defending Mrs T?  "To be honest, that's not been the topic of conversation in Scotland for quite some time - we've had other things on our plate," she says.  "I was was six months old when Margaret Thatcher came to power. I was in primary school when she left office - so it's not really something for my generation or the generations that come after me."  "I'm 37. You can vote now in Scotland at the age of 16 - so talk about Margaret Thatcher is the same as talking about Gladstone or Disraeli in terms of the distance that's there."  Seeking a weakness, I probed further: "Your mum and dad, they lived in a castle?" She snorted with derision. Her parents were working-class Tories and she was brought up in a housing estate.  You get the drift that she's as vulnerable as a claymore, and sharp with it too. I geo-name-dropped that I'd been to Chechnya: quick as a flash she was chatting about its neighbours, Dagestan and Ingushetia. Her interest in abroad was galvanised by her time as a signaller in the Territorial Army. She served for a bit in Kosovo and was moved by what she saw.  The one thing that got her goat, which she didn't block with her customary good humour, was homophobia.  "I do call out and will challenge or retweet or draw attention to it when people make homophobic remarks about me, because I've got a lot of young followers on Twitter, and I think they have to see that it is OK to say, 'That's not acceptable language. I do not have to accept this.'  "It's important in their lives, rather than a tough old bird like me."  In Davidson, the Tories have, cleverly or not, picked someone similar in appearance and brutal good humour to the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon. Davidson, too, has - like the late Denis Healey and Boris Johnson - that most precious quality thing in politics: authenticity.  But the polls aren't shifting in her favour and you wonder just how grim things would be for the Scottish Tories if she wasn't at the helm.  John Sweeney was reporting for BBC Newsnight - watch his piece here. He also plans to profile Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.	politics

A 24-hour walkout by junior doctors ended at 08:00 GMT, and conciliation service Acas said fresh talks would start on Thursday.  The next proposed strike is a 48-hour one beginning on 26 January.  More than 4,000 operations were postponed amid the dispute.  Some 3,300 were ones scheduled on Tuesday - meaning one in 10 on the day were hit by the strike - with the rest of the cancellations coming in the days before and after the action.  NHS England said about 10,000 junior doctors had reported for duty out of 26,000 scheduled to work the day shift on Tuesday - although many of those had agreed in advance to come in to make sure emergency cover was provided.  The action came after talks between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government failed to reach agreement on a proposed new contract for junior doctors.  The BMA, which is concerned about pay for weekend working, career progression and safeguards to protect doctors from being overworked, said the strike had sent a "clear message" to the government.  However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the walkout as "completely unnecessary" and urged junior doctors to return to the negotiating table.  The last time both sides met formally was on Friday, but negotiations were put on hold while the strike was held.  Officials from Acas said they would hold discussions with both sides on Thursday and Friday, although government sources said they were still prepared to impose the contract if the deadlock could not be broken.  Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which represents the government in contract talks, said he wanted to see that happen.  "I'm really hopeful that when the BMA return to the talks we can give junior doctors more confidence in both the pay offer that we're putting to them, but also the improved protections we want to put in place around their safety.  "I am desperate to avoid another repeat of industrial action at the end of the month. It's not in their interest and it's not in the interest of patients."  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  The walkout by junior doctors happened as hospital bosses continue to play catch-up after thousands of operations were cancelled at the start of December - when doctors were first due to go on strike.  That walkout was called off at the last minute to allow talks to restart.  The NHS is meant to ensure patients are seen within 28 days of a cancellation, but that is expected to prove difficult to achieve given the numbers in the system and the fact it is winter - the busiest time of year for hospitals.  A spokeswoman for NHS England apologised for the disruption caused on Tuesday, saying cancelled tests, appointments and operations would be rescheduled "as soon as is possible".

The French investigators found that fat cells release a protein that drives prostate cancer's spread in mice.  Human fat cells release the same protein, they told Nature Communications.  The researchers hope that drugs which block it could help treat men before the disease becomes too advanced.  Drugs that do this are already being tested in human trials for another, unrelated health condition - asthma.  In the UK, about one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives.  Diagnosed early, the chances of survival are generally good. But prostate cancer kills more than 10,000 men a year in Britain.  Many cancers are linked to being overweight.  But any link with prostate cancer has been less clear.  Lead researcher Dr Catherine Muller, from Toulouse University, says while obesity may not make prostate cancer more likely, it does appear to fuel its growth if a tumour is already present.  "This is something people need to know. People are aware about obesity's importance in other cancers and diseases, but not for prostate cancer."  Her lab work shows how the protein CCL7 from fat cells signals for cancer cells to move out of the prostate gland and into the surrounding tissue.  In obese mice who had been fed a high-fat diet, tumour spread outside the prostate was greater than in mice with normal body weight and was linked to higher levels of CCL7 and its target receptor CCR3.  They then studied more than 100 human tumour samples and confirmed that the aggressive cancers tended to have more CCR3 receptors than less aggressive ones.  Dr Aine McCarthy, Cancer Research UK's science information officer, said: "This research in mice sheds light on why obese men with prostate cancer are more likely to have aggressive tumours. It shows for the first time how fat cells surrounding the prostate use chemical signals to talk to tumour cells, enticing them to move and spread around the body.  "Excitingly, the researchers proved that jamming communications between fat cells and tumour cells stopped the cancer spreading. The next step is to assess if this approach, using drugs that are already being developed, could benefit men with the disease."	health

David Cameron told a committee of MPs there had been an "attitudinal change" which he wanted to see continue.  He cited the example of the Somerset Levels, where dredging of rivers has resumed in a bid to avoid a repeat of flooding seen in 2013-14.  He also defended the response to floods in northern England and Scotland.  In an appearance before the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Cameron said: "You've seen quite an attitudinal change in the Environment Agency that in years gone past, I think, were trying to balance up the effects on nature on the one hand and protecting property on the other hand.  "We've said to them: 'The time for that is over. This is about protecting human lives. This is about protecting our homes.'  "I want to see that continued shift. You saw that very directly in Somerset, where there is a man-made environment and it was ridiculous those rivers weren't being dredged.  I threatened to go and drive the dredger myself. Those rivers have now been dredged.  "Do we need an attitudinal change in the way we approach flooding? Yes, we absolutely do."  The Environment Agency, which covers England, is responsible for managing the risk of flooding from main rivers, and issues flood alerts and warnings.  But that was not the reason it was set up or the main part of its remit.  "We work to create better places for people and wildlife, and support sustainable development," the agency says on the "what we do" section of its website.  Several storms wreaked havoc across the UK in December, with Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire among the worst affected by the floods.  Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland also saw flooding and damage from a series of storms, including Desmond, Eva and Frank.  The environment agency's chairman, Sir Philip Dilley, resigned on Monday after coming under pressure for holidaying in Barbados during the recent floods.  Last month the agency's deputy chief executive said a "complete rethink" of the UK's flood defences was required, saying better waterproofing of homes and improved warning systems were vital for tackling future weather extremes.  Mr Cameron told MPs more could be done, saying that "the country wants us to do more and we will do more".  The authorities need to get better at river management and more flood defences are needed, he said.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35262535	I fathered 800 children, claims sperm donor	The number of women using donated sperm to get pregnant is rising, but many find the cost of treatment at private clinics prohibitive. This has led some women to use unlicensed donors - but are they putting their health at risk?  Simon Watson, 41, has been an unlicensed sperm donor for 16 years, donating once a week.  "Usually one [baby] a week pops out. I reckon I've got about 800 so far, so within four years I'd like to crack 1,000," he tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme..  "I've got kids all the way from Spain to Taiwan, so many countries. I'd like to get the world record ever, make sure no-one's going to break it, get as many as possible."  Very few women are eligible for artificial insemination on the NHS as the criteria are very strict. Private licensed clinics cost between £500 and £1,000 for each cycle of treatment. Men are allowed to father no more than 10 children.  Mr Watson charges £50 for his services - the "magic potion pot" - and most of his clients find him on Facebook.  They ask him questions, such as whether he has any hereditary diseases, then they meet, often at a service station on the M1. Clients either book a room in the hotel or use the public toilets.  He provides his own pot and syringe, and is tested for STDs every three months, posting his hospital certificate online. He claims a third of his donations work first time.  "If you go to a fertility clinic people have to go through lots of hurdles - counselling sessions, huge amounts of tests and then charge absolute fortunes for the service - but realistically if you've got a private donor you can just go and see them, meet them somewhere, get what you want and just go," he explains.  But critics say while it's not illegal, using unregulated donors puts women at risk of sexual diseases, hereditary disorders and men interested in "no strings" unprotected sex.  Laura Witjens, chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust, says it does not often go wrong, but when it does, it goes "horrifically" wrong.  "There are too many occurrences where in other circumstances it would be called sexual harassment or rape."  She says the language around donation is "lovey dovey" and focuses on people wanting to "help" and people celebrating successful pregnancies.  "But if you strip it down to bare facts, you have a man who for whatever reason feels they need to impregnate over 500 women, you have women who are comfortable knowing their children have 500 half siblings, in another setting people would be appalled. They would ask questions, find it very disturbing."  The HFEA says one in 10 IVF cycles used donated gametes or embryos in 2013 - the most recent year for which figures are available - and the number has grown.  In 2013, 49,636 women had a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF or Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (Icsi), of which 2,527 involved the use of donor sperm and 2,379 women had a total of 4,611 cycles of donor insemination.  Mr Watson, who has been married twice, has three children. It was after his first marriage ended that he started to donate.  "I thought I didn't want to go through all that again, I'd much rather go down to a sperm bank, have kids there, and if they ever come and see me later that's great, but if they don't, they don't," he says.  He admits his motivation could be linked to boosting his ego.  "I didn't get my first girlfriend until I was 18. I thought, 'I'm never going to get married and have kids.' A psychologist would say that's where it stemmed from, but I don't know, I've never been to one," he explains.  The regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), limits the number of families created by a single donor father to 10.  It says social research into numbers of siblings shows someone could be comfortable with having that many half siblings.  Mr Watson's son Thomas helps him with his Facebook page. The 20-year-old says: "When a photo comes up it makes me happy and it's nice to know I have another brother or sister out there. All the time you get another random brother or sister pop up and you're like, 'Wicked.'"  But Ms Witjens said the issue of child welfare was hard to ignore.  "Knowing you have 500 half siblings out there, when people have the need to find their family, we know that's very disturbing for these people. Women think about their cute little baby but forget they grow up into adults who do their own Facebook research."  All children born as the result of sperm donation since 2005 will have the right to know the identity of their father when they turn 18. However, a donor is not the legal parent and is not named on the birth certificate.  But with an unlicensed donor a woman can ask for child support at any time - and the man could claim paternity.  Ms Witjens says she appreciates that the cost of treatment can be expensive and some do not want to be in the clinical system.  "But if you can't afford £1,500 to secure safety for yourself and your child, you should wonder if you're fit for parenthood. It's an expensive job.  "What I find surprising is women investigate holiday destinations more than this."

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35242180	Do we need more than two genders?	A growing number of people refuse to be put into male or female categories, either because they do not identify as male or female, or because they are going through transition to the opposite gender.  Germany, Australia, Nepal and Pakistan now offer a third gender option on official forms with other countries set to follow suit. And scientists are finding more evidence to suggest that even biological sex is a spectrum.  Do we need to re-imagine our binary world and rethink one of the most basic parts of our identity?  Four experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme.  Brin Bixby was brought up as a boy, and went on to get married and father children before coming out as bigender. She set up Bigender.net, which reflects the view that gender is a spectrum.  "In college I wore a dress on Halloween, and it was supposed to be a joke, and the people helping me thought it was going to be hyper-real, exaggerated. [But] I didn't want to be a drag queen, I wanted to be a woman, and I think it took people by surprise.  "It was the first time I looked in the mirror and saw myself. People interacted with me as a woman: they saw me the way I wanted them to.  "I would be most comfortable if I didn't have to think about my gender, but unfortunately that's not how it works for me and a lot of other non-binary people.  "We have a cultural understanding of what gender is and looks like, and in the west we have a very binary view of it. My sense of gender as a part of my identity shifts.  "I present as a woman everywhere I go, except for at work and at my children's school, because it gets very exhausting to have to explain gender fluidity to everyone I meet.  "Ideally we would not make gender such a huge focus of our culture, which would give people the freedom to inhabit their gender in ways that feels most comfortable to them.  "What we're seeing now is a relaxation of the sense of binary amongst younger people and internet-savvy people who are inhabiting much more fluid spaces."  "We know there's a gender continuum, because there have always been effeminate boys and masculine girls. Transgender is certainly not a western phenomenon. In many cultures all over the world there are traditionally third gender or gender-fluid identities.  "There are the Hijras in India, what are known as two-spirited people in Native American culture, Muxe in Mexico, and the Bakla in the Philippines. The space these people have occupied has receded with the spread of the Judeo-Christian ethic and western culture, but they're still very much there.  "There's a tendency in the west to idealise these. But the truth is that if you're Bakla or two-spirited, there are only certain things in your culture you can do. In India, the Hijras are basically cast out of society, only good for begging and sex work. So it's not necessarily a great life.  "I was talking to a remarkable gender therapist named Diane [Erinsaft] and I suddenly started worrying that if she'd been around when I was a little boy, I might have been turned into a little girl. She laughed and said 'No, you're definitely a guy'.  "But we started talking about the potential risk of the transgender movement establishing new binaries where, if you have a girly boy, and you're worried about how effeminate this child is, you could very easily solve the problem by taking the child to the doctor and the doctor can wave a wand and say 'Your girly boy is now a princess'.  "Wouldn't it be better if we had a society that just raised children so that it was okay to be a tomboyish girl, or a girly boy, and to explore that?  "Diane speaks about 'gender smoothies'; she got this from one of her patients who said 'I'm not a girl or a boy, I'm a gender smoothie, I mix it all up together'."  Dr Imran Mushtaq is a consultant paediatric urologist who works with children with differences in sex development (DDS) at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Around 1 in 1500 babies are born with DDS but up to 1 in 100 people have less obvious differences.  "Absolutely sex is a spectrum. It's not binary in any way and we are slowly coming to understand this.  "As a specialist working in this area for the last 12 years, I've seen us transitioning so much in the way we think about sex and the way we treat children in whom the sex is not clear, and we are increasingly becoming aware how complex the issue is.  "How do you define what sex a child is? Is it the physical characteristics, the genitalia - do they have testicles, do they have ovaries or do they have both? Is it their chromosomes, is it their hormones?  "You can have a child whose chromosomes are XX, typical of what you'd associate with being female, yet their genitalia looks like a boy.  "Ten or 20 years ago when children were born with these kind of problems, there was very little discussion about not doing surgery. It was almost a given that the child would need surgery to make it a boy or a girl.  "As a doctor and surgeon, I'm increasingly uncomfortable about undertaking what is irreversible surgery.  "We know that the outcomes of surgeries that were undertaken 10, 20 years ago are not necessarily as good as we would like them to be. Now is the next stage: in 10 or 20 years' time we will find out the outcome of not doing the surgery or maintaining these children in a certain sex, whereas previously they would have been changed to a different sex.  "I don't think we should have gender categories. I don't think that sex should be on birth certificates, I don't think sex should be on driving licences and I don't think sex should be on passports.  "We are just what we are. We have a name, we have a date of birth, give us a number."  Tamara Adrian is Venezuela's first transgender congresswoman although since it has not been possible legally to change your gender in Venezuela since 1998, she was sworn in under her old name, as a man.  "I've been saying for more than 15 years that gender as a legal category must be suppressed, because it is a way to deny rights or grant rights to male or female. Gender has the same effect that race or religion had in the past: there were two groups, one that was privileged and had rights, another that was underprivileged and didn't have rights.  "It is exactly the same with gender. If you are male, you have rights that females don't have, and this legal category of male and female is still being used to prevent equal rights: for instance, when you advertise a job and ask for someone you say female or male.  "I think [the idea of a legal third gender] will be the first test for this future solution in which gender will be suppressed in the legal document.  "It could be a solution because initially some of the [gender fluid] people in Nepal or India or Pakistan were not able to legally exist. They were not able to vote or go to school, and in general they were deprived of any basic rights. So it is an alternative in these countries.  "In other countries such as in Australia or in Germany which do not categorise a person within the male or female boxes, it's the first step in order to have a much more gender fluid world. But in Australia, for instance, they are allowing people to choose not to be considered legally male or female. But in those cases, you are deprived of the right of marriage.  "We see a little of the possibility [of a less binary future] when you talk about a metrosexual man, or you see women that allow themselves a suit one day and the following day to use a dress with high heels.  "That's part of this gender fluid world in which you are not prevented to use the clothes that you want or to express your gender in the way you want."

This is probably because starch in spuds can trigger a sharp rise in blood sugar levels, they say.  Their study in the BMJ tracked more than 21,000 pregnancies.  But UK experts say proof is lacking and lots of people need to eat more starchy foods for fibre, as well as fresh fruit and veg.  Swapping a couple of servings a week for other vegetables should counter this, say the authors.  UK dietary advice says starchy foods (carbohydrates) such as potatoes should make up about a third of the food people eat.  There is no official limit on how much carbohydrate people should consume each week.  Some - high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods - release the sugar quickly into the bloodstream.  Others - low GI foods - release them more steadily.  Pregnancy puts extra demands on the body, and some women develop diabetes at this time.  Gestational diabetes, as it is called, usually goes away after the birth but can pose long-term health risks for the mother and baby.  The BMJ study set out investigate what might make some women more prone to pregnancy diabetes.  The study followed nurses who became pregnant between 1991 and 2001. None of them had any chronic diseases before pregnancy.  Every four years, the women were asked to provide information on how often potatoes featured in their diets, and any cases of gestational diabetes were noted.  Over the 10-year period, there were 21,693 pregnancies and 854 of these were affected by gestational diabetes.  The study took into account other risk factors, such as:  It found a 27% increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy in the nurses who typically ate two to four 100g (3.5oz) servings of boiled, mashed, baked potatoes or chips a week.  In those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips a week, the risk went up by 50%.  The researchers estimate that if women swap their potatoes for vegetables or whole grains at least twice a week, they would lower their diabetes risk by 9-12%.  Cuilin Zhang, lead study author, from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, US, said the findings were important.  "Gestational diabetes can mean women develop pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and hypertension," she said.  "This can adversely affect the foetus, and in the long term the mother may be at high risk of type-2 diabetes."  But UK experts stressed there was not enough evidence to warn women off eating lots of potatoes.  Dr Emily Burns, of Diabetes UK, said: "This study does not prove that eating potatoes before pregnancy will increase a woman's risk developing gestational diabetes, but it does highlight a potential association between the two.  "However, as the researchers acknowledge, these results need to be investigated in a controlled trial setting before we can know more.  "What we do know is that women can significantly reduce their risk of developing gestational diabetes by managing their weight through eating a healthy, balanced diet and keeping active."  Dr Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said: "As the authors acknowledge, it is not possible to show cause and effect from this study.  "The evidence tells us that we need to eat more starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, pasta and rice, as well as fruit and vegetables to increase fibre consumption and protect bowel health.  "Our advice remains the same: base meals around a variety of starchy foods, including potatoes with the skin on, and choose wholegrain varieties where possible."	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35295400	David Cameron defends drone strike investigation	Prime Minister David Cameron clashed with a senior Conservative MP as he defended the investigation into a UK drone strike in Syria.  Andrew Tyrie asked why military aspects of the operation were excluded from the probe carried out by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC).  The PM said the UK was currently engaged in a military operation and the ISC was set up to look at intelligence.  He also defended his claim of 70,000 "non-extremist" moderate Syria forces.  The bad tempered-exchanges with Mr Tyrie came as Mr Cameron was questioned on Syria by the Commons Liaison Committee.  In September, the PM announced that two British Islamic State jihadists, Cardiff-born Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, had been killed by a UK drone strike in Syria.  MPs have since voted to authorise UK air strikes in the war-torn country.  Mr Tyrie, who chairs the committee, asked whether the investigation into the strike would be seen as "incomplete" or even "meaningless" if it could not include its military background.  The PM said he did "not agree with this for a moment".  MPs cannot oversee current military operations, he said, telling Mr Tyrie the UK was currently engaged in an operation against a terrorist group that intends to "blow up, kill and maim our citizens".  The strike was "necessary and proportionate", he added.  "That's what is going on," he said, adding that "if you don't think there is a cell of people sitting in a cell in Raqqa who are planning to try and do damage to this country then you don't know what you are talking about".  After the committee meeting, Mr Tyrie released a statement urging the prime minister to change his mind and allow a "proper inquiry".  "On the basis of today's evidence, the Intelligence and Security Committee will not be able to do a thorough job," he said.  Until the ISC can examine military aspects of the strike, he said, it will not be able to reassure Parliament and the public that the strikes were "necessary and proportionate".  Mr Cameron makes regular appearances before the Liaison Committee, which is made up of select committee chairmen.  He was grilled by defence committee chairman Julian Lewis on why he would not provide more details of the 70,000 troops he described as "non-extremist opposition fighters".  The figure had been provided by the Joint Intelligence Committee, he said, and he did not want to give Syrian President Assad a list of the groups he should be targeting.  They are not all "impeccable democrats", he said: "Some do belong to Islamist groups and some belong to relatively hardline Islamist groups."  The PM also said he was prepared to take another look at offers to take in Syrian refugees made by individuals including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former Labour minister Yvette Cooper - after home affairs chairman Keith Vaz said they had been rejected as they had "not been cleared".	politics

Conservative MPs cheered as English and Welsh members prepared to give their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said he was "very proud" to be implementing the reforms.  But the SNP said the changes were "driving Scotland out of the door".  They were introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland.  Where parts of a bill are deemed to only affect England, or England and Wales, a new stage is added to the usual law-making process at which only MPs for English - or English and Welsh - constituencies can vote.  Following the end of the Housing Bill's report stage, Speaker John Bercow suspended the sitting of the Commons for five minutes before finalising which provisions applied to which nations.  After MPs debated the new rules - SNP members were entitled to speak but not to vote - the "consent motion" for England and Wales was agreed without a division.  The Housing Bill, which includes an extension of the right-to-buy for housing association tenants in England, was later approved by all MPs at third reading stage.	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35297046	Junior doctors' strike: Your questions answered	Hospitals in England are facing major disruption as junior doctors have gone on strike in a dispute with the government over a new contract.  The walkout - the first of two planned for the coming weeks - comes after talks between the union and government failed to reach agreement on the proposed new contract.  The BMA is concerned about pay for weekend working, career progression and safeguards to protect doctors from being overworked.  But ministers have argued the current arrangements are outdated and changes are needed to improve standards of care at the weekend.  Our health correspondent Nick Triggle has been answering your questions on the issue. Here is a selection of your questions:  Alfred Newman asks: Doesn't the government simply want to take away overtime pay and incorporate it into a seven day contract, meaning junior doctors will be paid far less for working weekends?  Nick Triggle replies: The NHS is available 24/7 - but the government just wants to increase the number of services available at weekends.  The contract put forward means they will not get as much as they would have for working weekends as they do under the new contract, but they have guaranteed they won't lose out overall.  I guess the best way to describe this is no more money but more weekend working.  Robert Colquhoun asks why doctors are querying things now: They knew the pay and conditions well in advance of taking up their vocation, nobody forced them into it.  Nick Triggle explains: The whole pay argument is very complex. What we can say is the government has guaranteed that no-one - bar a very small number that do lots of overtime - will lose out on day one.  But the issue is that they will have to work more weekends without getting the extra pay they would have done and in the future their pay may not go up by as much because guaranteed paid rises linked to time-in-the-job are being scrapped and replaced with something more akin to performance-related pay.  Obviously there are lots of jobs where you don't know what you will be paid in a year or two's time. But doctors would argue medicine is different. They go into lots of debt to get into it and need some security about what the career progression is.  Rahul Mukherjee asks: How does the government expect to increase provision of weekend services with no additional funding and no additional junior doctors?  Having junior doctors work more weekends means less available to work during the week unless you increase working hours.  The government have said that over the course of this parliament there will be extra consultants and GPs recruited to meet demand. But it takes 10 years to train a consultant after five-to-six-years of medical school. It's five years to train a GP after medical school.  So with the current recruitment and retention crisis in the NHS, where are these additional staff going to come from?  Nick Triggle says: That is a very good question. Many argue the government has failed to set out exactly how it wants to use junior doctors. If hours don't increase and you don't recruit more then you are going to have fewer during the week.  There has been talk of nurses taking on more responsibilities - the government has promised there will be more of them.  And as you say GP and consultant numbers are due to go up. But this is something the government is probably going to have to address as this dispute continues.  You can see the whole Facebook Q&A session here.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35294637	Junior doctors' strike: Get back to negotiating table	Junior doctors have been urged to return to the negotiating table by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who described their 24-hour strike in England as "completely unnecessary".  NHS England said about 10,000 junior doctors had reported for duty out of 26,000 scheduled to work the day shift.  Thousands of routine operations have been cancelled during the walkout in protest at a proposed new contract.  The BMA said the strike sent a "clear message" to the government.  "We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long-term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives," said Dr Johann Malawana, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors' committee.  He said that junior doctors had "no confidence" in the new contract.  NHS England apologised to affected patients, and said trusts would try to reschedule cancelled appointments and operations as soon as possible.  The walkout, which began at 08:00 GMT, comes after talks between the union and government failed to reach agreement on the proposed new contract. The BMA is concerned about pay for weekend working, career progression and safeguards to protect doctors from being overworked.  But ministers have argued the current arrangements are outdated and changes are needed to improve standards of care at the weekend.  NHS England said more than 3,300 operations had been cancelled on Tuesday - about one in 10 of those planned.  Several hundred more operations have been impacted in the days before and after the strike.  Emily Rogers, from Cheltenham, told the BBC she had been due to have an operation to insert a new feeding tube, which had taken four months to arrange.  "I thought doctors got into [their profession] less for monetary value and more for how rewarding it was," she said.  There are more than 55,000 junior doctors in England, a third of the medical workforce, although just over 37,000 are BMA members.  Junior doctors who support the industrial action are providing only emergency cover during the 24-hour period.  BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was thought many of the 10,000 doctors who turned up were medics who had agreed to work to cover emergency care, although a few thousand were also likely to be doctors who were not members of the BMA and not taking part in strike action.  The BMA said: "Since we asked junior doctors who would be covering emergency care to go into work today it is hardly surprising that they have done so along with those who are not members of the BMA."  This was supposed to be a day of clear dividing lines with junior doctors going on strike, except those on shifts for urgent and emergency work.  But the understanding clearly broke down at Sandwell Hospital in the West Midlands.  The trust wrote to local junior doctors in a letter dated 11 January, saying they all needed to work because of an "internal incident" and that it anticipated high patient demand.  Under an agreement struck with the BMA, hospitals can recall striking doctors in the event of life-threatening emergency scenarios.  But the BMA argued Sandwell had not acted in line with the agreement and so instructed members not to heed the hospital management's call.  An awkward stand-off ensued after a handful returned to work. By late afternoon the hospital dropped its call for help and said things were under control.  It was an ominous illustration of what might go wrong in the current fraught atmosphere around the dispute.  Mr Hunt said the number that had gone into work showed "the values of the vast majority of junior doctors".  "We have some disagreements with the BMA over pay. But we all want to promise every patient who uses the NHS the promise of the same high-quality care every day of the week," he said.  "And at the moment we have an NHS where if you have a stroke at the weekends, you're 20% more likely to die. That can't be acceptable."  Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said the government's handling of the strike had been "utterly shambolic".  "Nobody wanted to see industrial action least of all the junior doctors, but we understand why they feel they have no other option," she said.  What patients need to know  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  The lessons of the 1975 doctors' strike  A day in the life of a junior doctor  On Tuesday morning, bosses at Sandwell Hospital in West Bromwich ordered junior doctors back to work after declaring a major incident due to a "very high" number of admissions, but that request was later retracted.  The BMA had refused to agree to the request, arguing it was not clear whether the situation qualified as a major incident.  "The number we have been able to safely discharge has increased so that services are safe for tonight and tomorrow," a hospital spokeswoman later said.  Anne Rainsberry, from NHS England, apologised to all patients in England who had been affected.  "It's a tough day but the NHS is pulling out all the stops, with senior doctors and nurses often stepping in to provide cover.  "NHS trusts are now working hard to reschedule cancelled tests, appointments and operations as soon as is possible."  The Patients Association, an independent health charity, urged "both sides to continue discussions".  "Any new contract must offer terms that are fair for doctors and protect them. Junior doctors are the backbone of the NHS, and it is vital that they are able to provide the safe and effective care that patients need," it added.

The prime minister said that "on any reasonable assessment", the government is meeting its carbon reduction and sustainability targets.  He also defended a decision to scrap a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project promised in the Tory manifesto.  He was being quizzed by MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee.  Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davis said everyone from the CBI to accountants Ernst and Young had highlighted how the government was falling behind in this area.  But the prime minister cited research suggesting the UK is second only to Denmark in terms of meeting its commitments.  He said the UK's offshore wind market was the largest in the world and 97% of the solar panels in the UK had been installed since he became PM in 2010.  The SNP's Angus MacNeil asked how the government's domestic energy policies would contribute to the worldwide climate agreement.  Mr Cameron said carbon emissions had fallen by 15% since 2010, funding for low carbon energy was being doubled and the UK was the first industrialised country to phase out coal-fired power stations.  "We have been good to doing what we said we would", he said, adding that his government had a "very good record to speak of".  Mr MacNeil then brought up the decision to abandon carbon capture and storage development projects, saying "one hand of government didn't know what the other was doing".  The PM said it was a collective decision taken by the cabinet, arguing that CCS was not as cost-effective as other technologies and the £1bn earmarked for the schemes could be better spent on flood defences and schools.  He had previously said CCS was "absolutely crucial" for the UK, so the decision to scrap a £1bn competition for a large-scale trial was criticised by the MPs.  CCS is the "Holy Grail" of the fossil fuel industry, the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin says.  If it can be made to work economically at industrial scale, it will capture the emissions from power stations that heat the climate, and bury them deep underground.  That would allow coal and gas to be burned in the low-carbon future deemed essential by all governments at the climate summit in Paris.	politics

The doctors are providing emergency cover only during the 24-hour walkout, which got under way at 08:00 GMT.  The NHS has so far postponed 4,000 routine treatments - about one in 10 planned - including knee and hip ops.  A West Midlands hospital has also asked doctors to come off the picket line to help after a surge in patients.  Bosses at Sandwell raised the alarm shortly after the strike got under way, saying beds were filling up and they were struggling to discharge patients.  But the British Medical Association has so far refused to agree to the request, arguing it is not clear whether it qualifies as a major incident.  The strike - the first of two planned for the coming weeks - has gone ahead despite a last-minute plea from Prime Minister David Cameron for doctors to call off the action, warning it would cause "real difficulties for patients and potentially worse".  The walkout comes after talks between the union and government failed to reach agreement on the contract.

"It's very hard to believe that junior doctors not being at their posts isn't going to have a serious adverse effect on patients and patient safety," he said.  But Anne Rainsberry, from NHS England, said "robust" plans were in place to protect patients.  "As ever, the safety and care of patients is our top priority," she added.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who joined the picket line at St Thomas' Hospital in London, told the BBC: "These people don't want to go on strike, they want to look after their patients, and we're just saying to Jeremy Hunt, 'Get back round the table now.'"  BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said: "We sincerely regret the disruption that industrial action will cause, but junior doctors have been left with no option.  "It is because the government's proposals would be bad for patient care as well as junior doctors in the long-term that we are taking this stand."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35193788	Fracking firms to test ground without planning permission	The government is set to remove another obstacle to the exploration for shale gas deposits in the UK.  Fracking firms will no longer need planning permission to drill boreholes to monitor water quality and carry out seismic monitoring.  The government says the same safety rules for oil and gas exploration will apply - and the use of explosives will be limited to avoid nuisance.  But critics say it will rob local people of a say and cause disruption.  A spokesman for industry body United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas said: "This simply brings the onshore oil and gas industry in line with water companies and other industries which drill dozens of boreholes a year and perform subsurface monitoring, including seismic surveys, as a matter of course, with no lasting impact on the environment and hardly anyone noticing."  But anti-fracking campaigners said the changes would give local people less control over what is happening in their area.  In a submission to a government consultation on the changes, one group said: "Seismic testing should be considered only as part of a planning application to drill, explore, test, extract".  Kathryn McWhirter, of Frack Free Balcombe, who wrote the submission, said her main objection was that new planning rules would pave the way for full scale fracking.  "It is a foot in the door. It is the beginning of 'permission creep,'" she told the BBC News website.  "It is taking views away from local councils and local people - and then soon they will have no say at all."  People in the North West of England have complained about tremors and booming noises in their homes, according to the Chester Chronicle.  The firm responsible, Igas, told the newspaper: "The gathering of seismic information has been a common and routine operation in the UK for some 40 years now."  The Department for Communities and Local Government said, in its response to the consultation, published on 17 December, that the move was needed to "enable monitoring and investigation work to be undertaken to inform any future planning application".  Other changes announced by the department will allow for more extensive testing of drinking water impacts, making the move to full-scale production safer.  But anti-fracking campaigners say the planned 24 month water testing regime is not nearly long enough to establish useable data.  The plans, contained in secondary legislation, are due to come before Parliament shortly.  They will also give firms the green light to build 15 metre high drilling rigs to test for methane in groundwater - one of procedures that has to be carried out before commercial fracking can begin. The current maximum height is 12 metres.  Firms will also be allowed to sink boreholes into old mine workings without planning permission.  The DCLG said: "The government considers that it is important to obtain seismic data to inform any potential proposals for petroleum exploration, and it would be beneficial to be able to do this early in the process.  "Having carefully considered the views expressed in response to consultation and the potential impacts, the government considers that it is appropriate to proceed with this proposal."	politics
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35282764	First child diagnoses in DNA project	The first children with debilitating "mystery" diseases have finally been given a diagnosis as part of a huge scheme to analyse people's DNA.  Four-year-old Georgia Walburn-Green's damaged eyes and kidneys and her inability to talk had baffled doctors.  She is one of the first to have her precise genetic abnormality identified through the 100,000 Genomes Project.  Her parents said the day Georgia was finally diagnosed was one of the biggest of their lives.  If a child is born with Down's syndrome or a heart defect, then families know what to expect.  Yet Georgia's mum and dad - Amanda and Matt - had only 20 minutes of "worry-free cuddling" when Georgia was born before their "world went from totally happy to totally devastated".  Doctors initially thought Georgia had water on the brain because of the size of her head.  She was given a tentative all-clear, but doctors knew something was wrong - they just could not identify what.  It was the start of more than four years of uncertainty for the family.  Amanda said: "That was very hard, I assumed if she was poorly, you go to hospital and it might be awful, but you'd know what's wrong and you deal with it.  "We didn't know if she would walk or talk or have a normal life expectancy.  "It's been a rollercoaster of what's going to turn up next, you're just on this unknown journey slowly finding problems."  Georgia's parents say she is a happy, social, animal-loving four-year-old with a knack for "wrapping people round her little finger".  But she has not grown as quickly as other children, has lumps inside her eyes which affect her sight and kidneys that do not work properly.  "And we don't know if she'll ever speak, she understands us and desperately tries but can't make the sounds she wants to," her mum added.  Doctors suspected Georgia's symptoms were down to errors in her DNA, which may have been inherited from her parents.  And that meant Amanda and Matt were not prepared to risk having another child.  The 100,000 Genomes Project is focused on understanding the genetics of cancer and rare diseases such as the one affecting Georgia.  Scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital performed a giant game of spot the difference between the entire three billion base pairs which make up each of Georgia, Amanda and Matt's DNA to find what went wrong.  Just before Christmas, doctors told them the genetic abnormality - in a gene called KDM5b - had been identified.  "That was one of the biggest days of my life, we've been searching for this for four years," Amanda said.  While the knowledge will not change the way Georgia is treated today, it offers hope that there will be a therapy in the future.  And in good news for the Walburn-Green family, Georgia's mutation arose spontaneously rather than coming from her parents - meaning they will try to add to their family.  However, some children such as Jessica are already benefitting from the 100,000 Genomes Project.  Again, despite repeated tests, her condition which included epileptic seizures remained undiagnosed.  But analysing her and her parents' DNA discovered an error causing GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome.  She is unable to transport sugar into her brain's cells, which is leaving it starved of energy. But a high fat - or ketogenic - diet should give the brain an alternative energy source meaning less epilepsy medication is needed.  Prof Lyn Chitty, who is leading the project at Great Ormond Street, said: "It's really exciting to see the results coming through and the difference this can make for families.  "It increases confidence in the project and shows that the application of genomics can live up to the promise of changing the way we diagnose and treat patients in the future."  The first adults were diagnosed through the 100,000 Genomes Project in Newcastle last February.	health
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35284800	David Cameron challenged on climate policies	The PM has been accused of double standards over climate change, ahead of a Commons committee appearance.  Select committee chairmen Huw Irranca-Davies (Labour) and Angus MacNeil (SNP) said he has scrapped UK schemes aimed at cutting emissions, despite pledging internationally to protect the climate.  They singled out the decision to axe a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project promised in the Tory manifesto.  The government said the CCS scheme had always been "subject to affordability".  David Cameron is due before the Commons Liaison Committee later, which is made up of MPs who chair Commons select committees.  He will be questioned on climate change, as well as the conflict in Syria.  Mr Cameron had said CCS was "absolutely crucial" for the UK, so the decision to scrap a £1bn competition for a large-scale trial CCS plant is being criticised by the MPs.  CCS is the "Holy Grail" of the fossil fuel industry.  If it can be made to work economically at industrial scale, it will capture the emissions from power stations that heat the climate, and bury them deep underground.  That would allow coal and gas to be burned in the low-carbon future deemed essential by all governments at the climate summit in Paris.  Mr MacNeil, who chairs the energy and climate change committee, told BBC News the decision to scrap the CCS fund was incomprehensible.  He said: "The prime minister said that carbon capture and storage was crucial to meet our climate change targets.  "Yet the government's long-promised carbon capture competition has become the latest low-carbon policy to be chucked on the scrapheap by the government."  Mr MacNeil said "sudden changes" to energy policy were undermining investor confidence in the energy sector.  He added: "The prime minister must acknowledge that building a new generation of gas plants means that we either have to fit power stations with carbon capture technology in the coming decade or potentially bust our carbon budgets."  Mr Irranca-Davies, chairman of the environmental audit committee, added: "We're hearing a growing gulf between the prime minister's bold talk about climate change on the international stage and the short-termism and incoherence of decisions on energy and sustainability at home."  On another issue, Conservative Neil Parish, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee, warned that flood relief would have to be a "much bigger priority" for the government if flooding becomes "the new normal".  In an appearance before the liaison committee in December 2014, Mr Cameron said carbon capture and storage was "absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively".  He said more needed to be known about CCS before committing to it, which is why the government committed £1bn for the trial.  Energy industry leaders were astonished when the fund was scrapped without explanation following November's Autumn Statement.  The Department for Energy and Climate Change told the BBC: "The government was clear that this was subject to affordability.  "The Spending Review was a tight financial settlement and difficult decisions have had to be made. CCS (still) has a potential role in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK."  The decision to scrap the CCS trial was applauded by Nigel Lawson's pressure group, the Global Warming Policy Forum.  Its spokesman Benny Peiser told the BBC: "Worldwide, there are currently more than 20 pilot projects being funded.  "Let's wait and see whether the controversial technology will ever be viable at large scale. If so, Britain could simply buy it off the shelf if need be."  But Professor Dieter Helm, from Oxford University, a supporter of many of the government's other energy reforms, said: "It's a no-brainer that the shallow North Sea is the place to try out CCS, with lots of empty holes, pipelines, experience and gas plants nearby.  "So the question is really whether the UK cares about the climate change problem or is merely trying to achieve its carbon production targets at minimum cost."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35288335	Nine Tory bully victims won't give evidence to inquiry	Nine Tory activists whose claims are at the heart of the party's bullying scandal say they won't give evidence to the inquiry set up to investigate it.  They told BBC Newsnight they have lost faith in the inquiry set up after death of activist Elliott Johnson.  A Conservative spokesman said it was "not appropriate to comment" while the probe is ongoing.  Clifford Chance, the law firm undertaking the inquiry, insists it has made "significant progress to date".  Shortly before he died, 21-year-old Tory activist Mr Elliott complained he was being bullied by Mark Clarke, the director of a campaign which ferried hundreds of young Tories to target seats across the country before last year's general election.  The investigation was set up in November following his death. The news that several victims won't give evidence has raised new fears about its credibility.  Mr Clarke has denied the allegations - but the Conservative Party has revoked his membership and commissioned an investigation amid numerous other claims of bullying and harassment.  The scandal has already led to the resignation of Grant Schapps, a former Tory chairman, and there have been calls for Andrew Feldman, the current Tory chair, to step down too.  Nine potential witnesses have now told Newsnight they have lost faith in the investigation.  Some say it lacks true independence, while others fear they could be targeted for reprisals if they give testimony.  A letter sent out to potential witnesses from the firm appeared to give no firm guarantees that anonymity would be respected.  It said: "We will try to protect the identity of witnesses that give evidence about bullying and harassment by others. However, we may need to put such evidence to other witnesses to hear their version of events. We will try to do so in a way which does not identify the source of the evidence, but we cannot guarantee this will be possible."  One woman invited to give evidence told Newsnight she was too afraid to speak to the firm.  "I am worried that Mark Clarke and his associates will find out who I am, put my ID concretely with what I have said, find out where I live, who I am where, where I work - and that he and his associates will come after me and try to use force and intimidation to try to get me retract what I said."  She added: "If you cannot obtain the confidence of those you are interviewing and those who have been significantly damaged and affected... there is no point conducting an inquiry."  Activist says Tory chairman given bullying dossier in 2010  Josh Hitchens, President of Conservative Future, the activist wing of the Conservative Party at the London School of Economics, said he would not give evidence either.  Last month a confidential complaint he had made to the Tory party last year about Mark Clarke was leaked to the media.  He told Newsnight: "At the moment we have a situation where Clifford Chance are gathering the evidence, the witness transcripts and everything else. They are then passing them directly to the Conservative Party board who will make an assessment of them, edit them and then publish a report with them compiled.  "A significant body of that will contain confidential information from people who are making allegations of an extremely private and sexual nature.  "We don't believe that it is an independent inquiry. That very fact that there is a perception of lack of independence and integrity in the process nullifies it because a lot people who have crucial bodies of evidence aren't willing to submit that evidence because they don't believe it is a fair and independent inquiry."  In a statement to Newsnight, law firm Clifford Chance insisted it would protect potential witnesses.  "We take issues of confidentiality extremely seriously. Where witnesses previously gave evidence to the Conservative Party and were told that their evidence would be kept confidential, or where they request that our discussions with them remain confidential, we will not use that information in our report without their consent."  A Conservative spokesman said: "An investigation is currently underway and it is not appropriate to comment until we can establish the facts.  "The Crossbench Peer Lord Pannick QC has agreed to review the investigative process and to certify that it is objective, appropriate and comprehensive."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35281203	Labour's Catherine McKinnell quits shadow cabinet	Shadow attorney general Catherine McKinnell has resigned from the shadow cabinet, citing concerns over Labour's direction under Jeremy Corbyn.  Ms McKinnell said Labour was heading down an "increasingly negative path" amid "internal conflict" stemming from the recent shadow cabinet reshuffle.  The first shadow cabinet member to quit since Mr Corbyn's reshuffle also cited family reasons and a desire to speak in Parliament outside her legal brief.  She has been replaced by Karl Turner.  Mr Turner, the MP for Kingston upon Hull East, is the former shadow solicitor general.  Just hours before Ms McKinnell's resignation, Mr Corbyn claimed the party was "moving on" from the internal ructions of recent weeks.  Last week's reshuffle saw the exit of shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden and former shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher - two critics of the leader - and the demotion of shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle to culture spokeswoman. Three other shadow ministers resigned in protest at the changes.  In her resignation letter, Ms McKinnell said being in the shadow cabinet had prevented her from speaking up on issues of importance to her constituents and that she felt she could serve them better as a backbencher.  The MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne North also said she was finding it more difficult to balance her professional and family commitments since the birth of her third child last year.  But she also expressed concerns about the "situation in which Labour now finds itself".  "As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour Party," she wrote.  "I therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics' you spoke so compellingly about.  "However, as events have unfolded over recent weeks, my concern about the direction and internal conflict within the Labour party has only grown and I fear this is taking us down an increasingly negative path.  "I feel that I would like to channel my energy constructively, into making positive changes for my constituents."  Speaking on the BBC earlier, Mr Corbyn defended the changes he had made to the shadow cabinet, saying they had brought more "diversity" into his top team and he was "happy" with the new line-up.  "We have a team which is strong," he told Radio 4's Today.  "We have widened the shadow cabinet to represent the diversity of the country and the membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  "I am happy with it. We are moving on."  But the BBC's Carole Walker said the latest resignation underlined the difficulties Mr Corbyn was having in moulding a shadow cabinet in his own image and reconciling the difficulties that existed in the Labour party.  Reacting to her departure, shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer told the Daily Politics that Ms McKinnell had been an "incredibly effective" performer in her post and that she would be a loss to the shadow cabinet.  He said while it was inevitable that reshuffles were a "flashpoint for differences", the party had to pull together and move on.  Shadow Treasury minister Richard Burgon said the "vast majority of Labour MPs agree on the vast majority of things".  Ms McKinell has held a number of frontbench positions since entering Parliament at the 2010 election. As shadow attorney general, she was responsible for providing legal office to Mr Corbyn and senior colleagues.  In another development, Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff has resigned as a ministerial aide to shadow communities secretary John Trickett.  She tweeted that she had stepped down to campaign against "Tory cuts" and to focus on her work on the health select committee.  Mr Corbyn was not present as Labour MPs gathered for the first time since the reshuffle on Monday evening.  Labour's general secretary, Iain McNicol, told the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting any change to the way the party makes policy would have to be agreed at its annual conference.  It follows Mr Corbyn's expressed desire to involve the wider party membership in policy-making.  At the next meeting, MPs are to put forward a motion that would remove his aide from the party's ruling National Executive Committee.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some Labour MPs were unhappy at the position on the NEC - usually reserved for a backbench MP - being held by someone in Mr Corbyn's team.  If the motion is successful, the aide in question - Mr Corbyn's Parliamentary Private Secretary Steve Rotheram - would have to resign.  The motion says: "Rotheram is well liked, but removing him would free up a space on the committee, and his replacement would be chosen by a vote of Labour MPs, rather than the leader's office."  The Labour leader is hoping to change his party's policy on one of the issues on which it is divided, the renewal of the UK's nuclear weapons system.  But there was a warning for his anti-Trident stance from Paul Kenny, of the GMB union, who said he would be asking tens of thousands of workers "what they think about the Labour Party effectively shutting down their jobs".  He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One unions would not go "quietly into the night" if the policy was changed.	politics

The PM said new mothers and teenagers with anorexia were among those who would benefit from improved services.  He also promised to flatten "sink estates", help families save, and more funding for parenting classes.  Labour said the PM had previously cut mental health spending, and the new pledges were "too little, too late".  Mr Cameron defended controversial education reforms, and praised "Tiger Mothers" who pushed children to succeed.  It was "the precise opposite of the 'all must have prizes' culture", he said, insisting that "children thrive on high expectation".  Setting out what he called a "lifecycle approach" at the charity Family Action in north London, Mr Cameron said many people now experienced "paucity of opportunity" rather than material poverty - although he acknowledged some of the latter did still exist.  Reforms would focus on four key areas - family life and early years; education; equal opportunity; and treatable problems such as mental health and addiction.  Improving family life was "the best anti-poverty measure ever", he said, promising to double funding for relationship counselling and to provide careers guidance and mentors, costing £70m over the next five years.  He also announced a relaunch of a coalition policy of parenting classes, which was criticised after a low take-up in a pilot scheme.  He said he wanted it to become "normal, even aspirational, to attend parenting courses", and his strategy would examine voucher schemes or other incentives to encourage people to attend.  The government also wanted to help build families' financial resilience, and planned to bring forward a scheme to help people on low incomes save, he said, adding that full details would be announced in the next Budget.  On education, he said state schools must learn from "elite schools", and teach character virtues and resilience as well as knowledge.  This included teaching "curiosity, honesty, perseverance and service", as well as the value of "hard work and concentration, and coming back from failure - the Tiger Mother's battle hymn".  The government would provide £1bn over four years for the National Citizen Service in England and Northern Ireland to show young people "the power of public service, not just self service", he said.  He hoped it would cover 60% of all 16 year olds, and become the largest scheme of its kind in Europe, he said.  On improving opportunities for all, he promised cash for a mentoring scheme targeting pupils at risk of dropping out of school, and plans to spend £140m to tear down "brutal" housing estates in England which he said "design crime in, rather than design crime out".  Mr Cameron also used his speech to promise action on "treatable problems", including mental illnesses and addiction.  Calling for a "more mature" conversation about mental health, he said new mothers and teenagers with anorexia would be among those to benefit from £1bn extra cash that was allocated in the Autumn Statement.  The PM also pledged more psychiatric support in hospital A&E departments, and for community services.  The specific measures on mental health, which will apply in England only, include:  Labour said mental health spending had dropped on David Cameron's watch, and the new announcements were "too little, too late".  Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow education secretary, said David Cameron was "fond of making speeches about families but absolutely woeful in following through".  The closure of many Sure Start children's centres, and "huge cuts to family support services, tax credit and welfare changes" had left "many, many more families in crisis", she said.  Lib Dem spokesman Norman Lamb, who was a health minister during the coalition government, said the PM's mental health plans "fell well short" of the ambitions set out by his party and the Conservatives in 2014.  "It will leave a disparity between physical health and mental health at the heart of our NHS. That is morally wrong and economically stupid," he said.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35239660	Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full	Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.  The veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident.  A former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.  Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela Eagle  Angela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.  The veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.  A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would "swim through vomit" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would "like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher".  He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be "honoured" for taking part in their "armed struggle", while attending a gathering to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.  Seema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.  Defeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to "unite and to take on the Tories".  Hilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.  A former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership. She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.  A former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.  The Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had "never, ever met or spoken to" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was "passionate" about.  The former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a "great honour" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist.  The Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.  Lord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.  Mr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a "gulf between the population and political class".  The Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.  The MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.  The Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.  The MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.  Another left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.  He continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria.  The former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.  The Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.

The term covers those who are fresh out of medical school through to others who have a decade of experience behind them.  So what responsibilities do they have? The BBC News website talks to three doctors at different stages of their career.  After graduating in 2014, Melody started two years of foundation training.  The first was spent in Scunthorpe Hospital, doing three four-month stints in different specialities, known as rotations. She worked in A&E, general surgery and gastroenterology.  At the moment, she is based at a GP practice, in the first of three rotations in her second year.  Her day starts at 08:15, and she sees her first patient at 09:00, then more throughout the morning.  At the end of the surgery, she has a debrief with another GP to discuss the patients she has seen and talk about anything she is not certain about.  There are prescriptions to be written over lunch, notes to be updated, phone calls to be made about test results and then more patients to see during the afternoon.  Melody's day working at the GP surgery ends between 18:30 and 19:30. But her work isn't over.  Once home, she has to fit in revision for exams, sometimes she has to prepare "goodwill" teaching sessions for other junior doctors and from time to time there are opportunities to present research to conferences.  Moving from one rotation to another means moving from place to place every four months. Experiencing different hospitals and teams is all part and parcel of learning, but it can make life difficult.  "It's hard being the new kid on the block again. There are lots of things that are individual to each rotation - getting to know your way around a new hospital, coping with a different IT system," she says.  "And you've got to start from the beginning each time."  Melody has eight years of training ahead of her - once she starts her chosen specialty of children's medicine next year - and that's if she doesn't choose to take time out along the way.  "It scares me a little bit because I see exhausted colleagues further along in training trying to juggle personal responsibilities, and I know the long days and nights are going to be even more challenging as I get older," she says.  "Sometimes I feel I'm letting family and friends down because I can't see them."  It's a long road full of real challenges, but they are also the "real joys of medicine", she says.  Job: A&E trainee in north Yorkshire in her third year of speciality training  After completing the two-year foundation programme in north-west England, Ellen went through a competitive process to qualify to do core surgical training.  But after completing the training, she decided surgery wasn't the right area for her.  She decided to take a year out to do research in London and then spent another year volunteering as a doctor in Africa, before settling on the specialty of emergency medicine.  Working in A&E is an unpopular lifestyle choice because of the hours, she says, but she loves the buzz.  "I really enjoy the immediacy of emergency medicine. Patients can arrive having any problems at all," she says.  "I get to see people at their worst moments - when I urgently need to find out what's wrong with them and sometimes save their life."  Ellen has to work one in every two or three weekends. She works blocks of night shifts, late shifts, twilight shifts and day shifts, which she says can make it difficult to see family and friends outside of work and have any other interests.  Leading a nocturnal existence for three or four weeks on the trot is not unusual.  With each passing year, junior doctors are given more responsibility - for patients and for other more junior colleagues.  "I work with other junior doctors who will ask me for advice, doctors more senior than me who I will ask for advice and consultants too," Ellen says.  "It's important we are all there working together."  Ellen's career path has not been straightforward - but that's not unusual. Many junior doctors take time out during their training, to teach, travel or do research.  She now has five more years to go in emergency medicine before she completes her training.  Job: Consultant in geriatric medicine after nine years of training  "Becoming a consultant after so many years of training wasn't a massive thing for me," Daniel says.  He had set his heart on becoming a champion for the most vulnerable people in society at an early stage of his training - straight after graduating in 2003.  Since then, the multiple health problems of elderly people - particularly dementia, frailty and incontinence - have been his focus.  "Medicine is a vocation. I felt the need to be an advocate for older people because they are one of the worst-served populations in the NHS.  "But there's so little research into dementia compared to cancer, for example."  He took time out during his training, to gain experience of different specialties with the aim of becoming a better geriatrician.  He was also awarded funding to carry out research into why and how the health problems of older people arise.  With a wife and two children, training as a junior doctor and moving around the country to gain experience in different hospitals was "a huge juggling act".  He spent time in numerous different places, including Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge and north, east and south-west London, during his training.  Family life suffered, but Daniel says it's even worse for nurses in training.  As a consultant, he is often expected to be on call for seven days in a row, working from 07:00 until 20:00 or 21:00. Although he will be in the hospital quite a lot of that time, he can also take time out to do paperwork.  Doing the very best for his patients is what drives him.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35280399	PM asks doctors to call off strike	David Cameron has urged junior doctors to call of their planned strike action.  He warned Tuesday's strike will cause "real difficulties for patients and potentially worse".  The strike begins across England at 08:00 GMT, from when junior doctors will only provide emergency care.  Talks between the doctors' union - the BMA - and NHS bosses continue. The BMA has said the strikes "demonstrated the strength of feeling amongst the profession".  Issues being disputed by the BMA and NHS include weekend pay and whether there are appropriate safeguards in place to stop hospitals over-working doctors.  Three strikes are set to take place from:  The Prime Minister called on medics "at the late stage" to get back around the table before the proposed walkout.  He said: "This strike is not necessary, it will be damaging.  "We are doing everything we can to mitigate its effects but you can't have a strike on this scale in our NHS without their being some real difficulties for patients and potentially worse."  NHS England estimates 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures will be cancelled as a result of the action along with 2,535 outpatient ones.  It says everything possible is being done to provide safe emergency care and minimise the impact on patients.  Anne Rainsberry, the NHS England director overseeing preparations, said: "We have tried and tested plans to deal with a range of disruptions including industrial action. As ever, the safety and care of patients is our top priority and the NHS has robust plans in place to ensure those who need emergency treatment will continue to receive it.  "We have been working with hospitals and other NHS providers across the country to ensure we can continue to protect the safety of our patients and provide the urgent services they need. We will monitor the situation across the country to ensure these plans are in place, and are ready to respond to any significant increases in pressure in any region over the course of this dispute."  Junior doctors' leaders are objecting to the prospect of a new contract.  The government has described the current arrangements as "outdated" and "unfair", pointing out they were introduced in the 1990s.  Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012, but talks broke down last year.  The government has indicated it will impose the new contract next year in England. The BMA has responded by initiating the industrial action process.  Junior doctors row: What you need to know  What exactly do junior doctors do?	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34946945	Junior doctors' strike in 1975	Junior doctors are on the cusp of downing their stethoscopes and scalpels and walking out of wards and clinics to take part in a wave of strikes across England on Tuesday.  Industrial action by this group is relatively rare. But it has happened before - the last major strike over pay and conditions by juniors was in 1975.  Some of the reasons behind the strikes are similar - dissatisfaction over pay and many medics feeling undervalued and overworked.  But what would the doctors of 1975 say to their colleagues today? Did the strike work? And is there anything today's juniors can learn from their colleagues?  Steve Iliffe, now a retired professor of elderly care, had only just qualified as a doctor when the first strikes began.  He worked as a house officer at Leicester Royal Infirmary and remembers the hours being "long and horrendous".  While an 80-120 hour week was standard, the longest shift he endured was 132 hours.  Apart from the hours, one of the other major issues at that time was that the rate of pay fell sharply after the first 44 hours were done - reducing by about two-thirds.  Though the standard working hours have decreased for many doctors, preventing juniors working excessive hours and the pay they receive for working anti-social hours are central to both conflicts.  But crucially in 1975 the whole atmosphere across the country was different, Prof Iliffe says.  The strike emerged against a background of frequent protests and picketing by, among others, nurses, hospital engineers, lab technicians, miners and ambulance crew.  The juniors found lots of other people around them - including paramedics, porters and of course patients, all involved in disputes of their own.  This may have made it more generally acceptable and easier to strike, with lots of ancillary staff supporting picket lines.  Action spread across the country and lasted several months - with doctors advised to stick to a 40-hour week.  But according to Prof Iliffe, who was a member of the Medical Practitioners' Union, strikes faded away as time went on.  He says doctors did win some concessions on pay but the hours didn't really change and many were left feeling deflated after all their efforts.  Prof Iliffe says: "What I learnt from 1975 is that we weren't clear at the beginning about what the end objective was.  "There wasn't a clear aim beyond a strong feeling that things weren't right.  "And my concern now is that they don't exactly know what they want either."  Meanwhile, Dr John Bache, a retired accident and emergency doctor and a houseman at the time of the strike, chose not to take action.  He remembers driving through the picket lines at the entrance of the hospital.  He said: "It was not a popular thing to do but I felt strongly that it was wrong to strike. And I still do.  "Striking puts the most vulnerable people - sick patients - at risk."  He feels it is probably harder to go against the grain today and not support fellow colleagues who want to strike.  Unlike 1975, social media has become a powerful force with many juniors expressing their views and some may feel pressure from these forums too.  Despite this, Dr Bache says he has a huge amount of sympathy for the doctors on the front line today.  "I'm sure what is going through their heads right now is the same as in 1975. They don't want to hurt their patients."  He says in many ways the work now is more technically challenging and the hours often more intense - with fewer colleagues to turn to for support.  Dr Bache remembers working a 100-hour week but the difference between 1975 and the rotas of today, he says, was that doctors weren't necessarily working every minute of their shifts.  There were moments to rest in the doctors' residence - and even catering staff to make you bacon and eggs once in a while.  Now, Dr Bache says, the 13-hour shifts are often relentless.  According to Dr Bache, what was different then was the public were very strongly behind the juniors - partly because many of them were striking too.  And back in those days you didn't question a doctor that much - those days are rightly over, he adds.  But he says: "What worries me at the moment is that something might go wrong and it would turn the public against the strike."  What is clear from both 1975 and the dispute of 2016 is that the cause has fired up thousands of medical staff who have never taken industrial action before.  It has brought them together as a powerful lobby group - both on picket lines and online.  And this won't be the last we hear of them.	health

Mr Corbyn's team quickly regained control of the @jeremycorbyn account and the offending tweets were deleted.  The Labour leader mostly tweets about party policy so the first of the hacked messages, which began "Here we... here we..." and contained three exclamation marks, would have alerted his followers to the fact that something was not quite right.

The strike begins across England at 08:00 GMT, from when junior doctors will only provide emergency care.  The BMA said the strikes "demonstrated the strength of feeling amongst the profession".  It announced three spells of strike action in England in November, after negotiations with the government ended without resolution.  Issues being disputed by the BMA and NHS include weekend pay.  "As a doctor, I can understand the anger and frustration felt by many junior doctors at this time," Dame Sally said.  "In part, this dispute is a symptom of frustration and low morale that has been building for decades and the strain that a career in medicine can place on your work-life balance.

The shadow justice secretary said the cabinet changes had been "an amazing distraction" from the country's issues.  But he said he "certainly wouldn't have fired" former Europe spokesman Pat McFadden, who Mr Corbyn sacked.  Meanwhile, Alison McGovern has resigned from a party policy review group saying she could not work with the leadership.  It comes days after three shadow ministers quit in protest at the reshuffle.  Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Lord Falconer insisted the Labour Party remains a "broad church" but to be effective that broad church must not be "at war with itself".  "The country needs an effective opposition," he told the BBC.  "The floods, the junior doctors about to go on strike for the first time in 40 years, what's going on with Britain's support for the justice system in Saudi Arabia, these are issues that we should be focusing on. They are just examples.  "We as a party, in the wake of the reshuffle, which is an amazing distraction from all of these issues, need to be coming together and doing the work to provide an alternative to this government, which is a very bad government."  When Lord Falconer was asked if he would have made the same decision as Mr Corbyn in the sacking of Mr McFadden from the shadow cabinet, he said: "The decision as to who is in and who is out of the shadow front bench team is entirely a matter for the leader."  But when pushed on the issue again, Lord Falconer said: "I certainly wouldn't have fired him."  Mr McFadden was given marching orders from his role as shadow Europe spokesman for apparent disloyalty.  Another shadow cabinet member, education spokeswoman Lucy Powell, told the BBC Two's Daily Politics: "We need to draw a line under last week's events and move on."  Labour should "realign our fire not on each other... but on this government," Ms Powell said.  She said the resignation of Ms McGovern - MP for Wirral South and chairman of Blairite pressure group Progress - from a child poverty policy review was "a shame because I think she has a huge amount to offer".  One of the key policy issues dividing Labour is whether to renew Trident, the UK's nuclear deterrent.  Mr Corbyn is opposed to nuclear weapons, and replaced his pro-Trident defence spokeswoman Maria Eagle with Emily Thornberry, who thinks it should be scrapped, in the reshuffle.  However, Ms Powell said she would be "very surprised" if Labour came out in favour of unilateral disarmament following its defence review.	politics

Alison McGovern told the BBC the shadow chancellor had suggested the group she chairs, Progress, co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers.  John McDonnell also accused Progress of having a "hard-right agenda", Ms McGovern said.  Labour said the review she said she was quitting had not yet been launched.  Ms McGovern's resignation comes after junior shadow ministers Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty, and Kevan Jones quit on Wednesday in protest at Labour's reshuffle this week.  The resignation of Mr Doughty on BBC Two's Daily Politics led to an official complaint from Labour, who accused the BBC of orchestrating the resignation for maximum "political impact" - something the BBC denies.  Ms McGovern, the Wirrall South MP, said Mr McDonnell had asked her to take part in the Labour's policy review on child poverty and combating inequality.  The pair were due to meet for the second time to discuss the subject on Wednesday, but Ms McGovern claims Mr McDonnell was late because he was making media appearances.  She told BBC's Sunday Politics: "So I'm there waiting to meet him to talk about it and all the while he'd gone to the TV studio to call the organisation that I am chair of 'hard-right Conservative', of having a hard-right Conservative agenda. That's not OK."  "We are all Labour members and we believe in having a Labour government - that's what we are, nothing more nothing less.  "And, as I say, I don't want to be on the telly talking about this but I have been backed into a corner and I have got no other choice now but to stand up and say 'this is who we are' and we should just get on with the business of getting a Labour government."  Progress is broadly seen as the Blairite wing of the party.  On Wednesday Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine programme: "We've had a few junior members resign today and of course that's their right.  "But they do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party based around the organisation Progress.  "I don't believe they have ever accepted Jeremy's mandate."  A Labour Party spokesman said: "Alison McGovern was invited to a discussion on child poverty but the initiative has not been launched or confirmed.

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35254508	How to deal with a medical emergency on the Space Station	A major medical emergency has never occurred on the International Space Station - but what would happen if it did? And what lessons could be learnt for treating similar emergencies on Earth?  When Tim Peake blasted into orbit in December, he knew that the 40 hours of medical training he'd received would prepare him for most health problems during his six-month stay on the International Space Station.  In addition to life-saving skills, he had been taught how to stitch a wound, give an injection and even extract a tooth.  According to Nasa, this training would prepare him and his crew members for the most common medical problems faced on the ISS - like motion sickness, headaches, back pain, skin conditions, burns and dental emergencies.  But faced with a far more serious medical emergency - what would they do?  The medical kit on the ISS is basic. It contains a first aid kit, a large book of medical conditions and some useful medical equipment including a defibrillator, a portable ultrasound, a device for looking deep into the eye and two litres of saline.  Although their lightweight ultrasound device can generate very clear pictures of the inside of the human body, and relay them to a medical team back on Earth for help with diagnosis, there would be no means of fixing the underlying problem on the ISS.  Dr David Green, senior lecturer in aerospace physiology at Kings College London, says a better option would be to return the patient to Earth in the Soyuz spacecraft docked to the ISS, a journey of around three-and-a-half hours. But that's far from straightforward.  "They have limited resources on the ISS but there are no life support facilities on Soyuz either. If it's a good flight back they could experience a g-force of 4g-5g on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. That's pretty unpleasant for a healthy individual, never mind someone who's critically ill."  The health and fitness of all astronauts is very closely monitored in the months before launch by a flight surgeon who looks after them and their family before, during and after their six-month stay on the ISS.  In a control centre on the ground, a team is constantly monitoring the astronauts, collecting data on everything from the exercise they are doing to what they are eating.  As a result, Dr Green says, the risk of an astronaut developing a serious illness and needing intensive care is very small, but it is still around 1% to 2% per person per year.  So it is likely to happen sooner or later.  The challenges of coping with serious medical emergencies are not just confined to the ISS.  Dr Fred Papali, who works in critical care medicine at the University of Maryland, US, and has spent time working in emergency wards in hospitals in Haiti and south Sudan, says there are lessons to be learnt for many remote, rural regions on Earth.  He sees parallels between the isolation of the ISS and some rural areas in low-income countries, where health care services are lacking.  "In many parts of the world, basic emergency and acute medical facilities just don't exist. It's challenging because the doctors there don't have experience or training... and patients are often clinging on to life with their pinky."  He has witnessed how hospitals with no running water and no electricity saved lives using ultrasound to make quick diagnoses in medical emergencies.  "It's a simple and revolutionary technology which can look more deeply," he says.  Dr Papali also says that the use of telemedicine - the remote treatment of patients by a doctor using an electronic video or audio link, which is so vital in space - should be more widespread in the developing world.  When an internet connection is all that is needed in a remote location to dial up an experienced doctor to ask for advice or to access information, "very cheap interventions can make a difference between life and death".  It is no real surprise that aerospace technology can benefit communities in disaster zones, in high-altitude areas, and in remote and isolated villages on terra firma.  Their needs are very similar. Medical devices in space must be small, light, robust, smart and low in power consumption. The same is true in remote regions.  So Nasa and the European Space Agency have made it their business to share the benefits of any innovations in aerospace technology with the wider medical and science community.  Training people to use the technology correctly is important too. Just as Tim Peake has been trained to use medical equipment and act like a space paramedic, similar training can be given to people in areas where there are shortages of doctors and healthcare workers, for example in sub-Saharan Africa.  As manned space missions are planned to the Moon, Mars and beyond, the need to improve emergency medical care in space increases even more.  Making a qualified doctor part of the crew might help with the problem of dealing with medical emergencies thousands of miles from home. It worked for the crew of the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek. But would carrying out emergency surgery in space be realistic?  At present, operations would be impractical in micro gravity because blood and fluids would leak out of the patient's body (which is three-quarters water), float around, infect other astronauts and contaminate the spacecraft.  Scientists in the US have been testing the idea of placing a transparent dome over a wound and then filling it with fluid, such as saline solution, to stem the blood flow. It could stop the bleeding or give a surgeon time to seal the wound.  Nasa is also planning to turn robots into space surgeons. The Robonaut 2 is already on board the ISS and the aim is that it performs basic medical functions which can be remotely controlled from Earth. Eventually the hope is that it could be programmed to carry out complicated surgery - but this is still some way off.  On long-duration space missions there would be a need for smarter medical devices, medications with a much longer shelf life and more extensive medical training.  It's a long way to Mars, and with a time delay of about 20 minutes each way when communicating with Earth, speedy medical advice won't be possible.  Space medicine experts have their work cut out - but you wouldn't bet against them coming up with an innovative solution which could benefit everyone.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35264042	Yes, Prime Minister: Still true to life after 30 years?	Thirty years ago, on 9th January 1986, Michael Heseltine picked up his papers from the cabinet table, and walked out of Number 10, precipitating a political crisis for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  On BBC One that evening, the Nine O'Clock News picked apart the political entrails.  At the same time, on BBC Two, in sitcom land, Britain was getting used to a new face in Downing Street, Jim Hacker. It was the first episode of Yes, Prime Minister.  Hacker's weekly battles with Cabinet Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, were comedy, but talking to those who were in Whitehall and Westminster at the time, it sometimes seemed more like a fly-on-the -wall documentary.  Back then, Richard Mottram was a young civil servant in charge of Mr Heseltine's office. Speaking to me for Hackers And Humphreys All, on BBC Radio 4 Extra, he underlined how life was not so far away from art.  "I said to him (Heseltine) 'have you told anyone?' because, being a good civil servant, I thought if he hasn't told anyone, we can always sort of 'un-resign' him. And he said 'Yes, I told the cameraman on the door', and then I realised we were doomed."  Jim Hacker began his screen life as a peripheral member of the cabinet in Yes, Minister (1980-1984), created and written by Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn.  The late Paul Eddington gave a memorable performance, bumbling from crisis to crisis, manipulated and checked by the late Nigel Hawthorne, who won successive BAFTAs for his verbal circumlocutions as Sir Humphrey.  Perhaps the biggest challenge for Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the creators of the series, was making Hacker's elevation to Number 10 credible.  Lynn told me: "There have been a large number of barely competent prime ministers and Hacker joins that rogue's gallery".  "He looked more regal when I said to him I think you're going to be prime minister… he loved the idea," says Lynn.  Perhaps more important than the performances of the three main actors - Derek Fowlds as Bernard Woolley, Hacker's Principal Private Secretary, was the third member of the triumvirate who were in every episode of both programmes - was the quality of the writing.  Research was conducted over long lunches with politicians and officials. Most are unknown, but some are so proud of their association with the programme that they've outed themselves.  Antony Jay, a former TV current affairs producer, also had good contacts of his own, having written speeches for leading Conservative politicians, including Geoffrey Howe.  Margaret Thatcher was a great fan of the series. The programme filmed exteriors in Downing Street, Eddington was allowed to walk through the famous door as Prime Minister Hacker, and the production designer was even given a personal tour. The result was a near perfect reproduction on screen of the cabinet room.  In 1984, Mrs Thatcher offered a tribute of her own to Yes Minister.  Asked to present an award to the writers, with her Press Secretary Bernard Ingham she devised a sketch, which she would perform at the ceremony with Eddington and Hawthorne in front of the media.  When she arrived at the venue, she told waiting journalists they would be witnessing "the premiere of Yes, Prime Minister".  At that stage, the writers hadn't even considered sending Hacker to Downing Street. The actors - neither of them admirers of Mrs Thatcher - didn't want to do it. Neither, though, wanted to provoke her displeasure by saying no.  In the 30 years since, Jonathan Lynn has lived in the United States, writing for the big screen and directing films, including My Cousin Vinny. Despite his experiences in Hollywood, he's still astonished by the time and resources lavished on the awards ceremony sketch, including blanket coverage by the media.  "They rehearsed it at Number 10 23 times. My reaction was: 'what the hell?, why weren't they running the country? What were they doing, rehearsing a sketch 23 times?" Then he pauses for a beat, adding with perfect comic timing, "A bad sketch".  He got his revenge when he and Jay accepted the award, congratulating the prime minister on "finally taking her rightful place in the field of situation comedy. It got, I think, maybe the biggest laugh of my career". Mrs Thatcher, he says, did not laugh.  Mrs Thatcher's sketch proposed the abolition of economists. In their version of life in Number Ten, Jay and Lynn got the laughs with more realistic scenarios. Some of them even went on to come true.  In The National Education Service - one of four complete episodes included in Humphreys And Hackers All - the prime minister considers giving parents the power to choose schools. The debate between the characters prefigures much of what was said during Tony Blair's attempts to change education.  "I actually remember a debate around the cabinet table", Mr Blair told me, "and people actually saying you shouldn't do that because then the other schools in the area who aren't performing adequately will feel very disgruntled by introducing this centre of excellence into the local community."  Mr Blair says his sympathies were always with his fictional Downing Street predecessor, Jim Hacker (whose political affiliations were never revealed), but he professes a sneaking admiration for Sir Humphrey Appleby.  Lord Donoughue, now a Labour peer, was Head of the Downing Street Policy Unit between 1974 and 1979. He suggested ideas for Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister and checked the scripts for accuracy.  But he says some of his fellow ministers in Mr Blair's government had paid a bit too much attention to the programme.  "It either made politicians and ministers sort of vary wary of taking civil advice, or because it demoralised a bit the civil service", he says, noting that some of his ministerial contemporaries, having watched Sir Humphrey's attempts to manipulate Hacker would sometime refuse to take sound advice.  The fictional Prime Minister Hacker has had four real life successors.  "I once had to write an essay on 'How true to life is Yes, Minister'", he recalled. "I think I wrote… that it wasn't true to life. I can tell you, as prime minister, it is true to life."  Shaun Ley presents Humphreys And Hackers All on BBC Radio 4 extra, on Saturday morning at 0900 GMT and again at 1900 GMT. It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35261637	BNP removed from official list of political parties	The British National Party risks being unable to stand for election - because it failed to pay its annual £25 registration fee.  Under the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000 all parties need to confirm their registration details with the Electoral Commission.  But despite having six months notice, the BNP missed the deadline.  BNP spokesman Stephen Squire said: "It's the first I've heard of it - it's obviously an oversight."  But former BNP leader Nick Griffin, who was expelled by the party in 2014, told LBC Radio the mistake was "either incompetence or it's a combination of a deliberate wrecking job which has been going on over the last year or so."  However, BNP chairman Adam Walker said the "media frenzy" created by the technical oversight "proves how relevant and newsworthy the BNP is."  By law, the Electoral Commission has to remove from its register any political party that fails to submit its details.  The BNP's statement of accounts were due on 7 July 2015, but despite a six-month window, the party had still not paid up by the final deadline on 7 January 2016, forcing the commission to take action.  Removal from the register means BNP candidates cannot use the party's name, description or emblems on ballot papers at elections.  But, a commission spokesman said if the party re-registered in the near future, its candidates would be able to stand under the BNP banner at this May's local elections.  However, if they wish to stand before the registration is considered, BNP candidates will have to stand as independents.  Mr Squire suggested the party had too much to lose to let its registration lapse further.  "After battling for 30 years to get the debate on immigration going, we don't want to waste it on a technicality," he said.  Party names and identities are protected for two years under the 2000 Act to prevent other parties using them.  Nick Griffin stepped down as BNP leader in July 2014 after 15 years at the top. His decision came after he lost his seat in the European Parliament and the party saw its vote collapse in that year's local elections.  But months of infighting followed and Mr Griffin was expelled from the BNP amid accusations that he had tried to "destabilise" the party.	politics

There is no such thing as a safe level of drinking, according to tough new guidelines on alcohol consumption.  The UK's chief medical officers have lowered the recommended maximum weekly number of units for adults.  The new advice says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine - with some alcohol-free days each week, while pregnant women should not drink at all  We've been asking you whether this new advice is going to change how you drink.  A short and to the point response came from Abi Allen and Chris Addison.  Bob Dutton welcomed the new information, while Emelyn Gregorio was thinking of changing the amount she drank.  Commenting on the BBC article on the issue, Sarah was considering stopping altogether.  "I think the message about limiting your alcohol intake is that it makes you healthier.  "I don't particularly want to live older, but I do want to live a life as full as I can.  "I quit smoking four or five years ago, and now I want to try and give up alcohol because I was bordering on alcoholic, as I was drinking every night, every day.  "I want to feel better, not sluggish and stupid like when I drunk."  David Handley and Can Lawton explained in Facebook posts why they would be unlikely to change their drinking habits.  Some people thought the new limits were evidence of the "nanny state".  "Common sense and a little of what you fancy has always been the best advice for eating and drinking. That and the nanny state minding its own business, rather than adding to our stressful lives, with its 'latest advice' (before it changes again), would make us all happier and healthier." Agrippa wrote on the BBC article.  Matt Sharp reminded people on Facebook it was only a recommendation and could be ignored.  Others had a more light-hearted outlook on the advice, with Rick Fleming commenting he'd have to get drunk tonight to stop worrying about his drinking.	health

The Treasury Select Committee is to question executives from the Financial Conduct Authority about their decision to drop a probe into pay and standards.  The chancellor says he had no knowledge of the "independent" decision.  But Mr Mann, a committee member, said this was a "bit weaselly", suggesting the FCA had been "told what to do".  The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.  But, at the end of December, it said it had decided a "traditional thematic review" would not help it achieve its "desired outcomes", promising instead to encourage the "delivery of cultural change".  The cross-party committee of MPs has called the FCA's acting chief executive Tracey McDermott and its chairman John Griffith-Jones to appear before them later this month to explain the background to the decision.  "The FCA's decision to drop its review of bank culture does seem curious," said Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the committee. "The decision to undertake this review was, after all, part of the FCA's business plan for 2015.  "It is not the dropping of the review that is crucial. What matters is the full implementation of the reforms recommended by the Vickers and Banking Commissions and set out to improve conduct in banks."  Mr Mann, the most senior Labour member on the committee, said he believed the Treasury not only knew what was going on but had been directly involved in the decision.  "It's my belief that the government has interfered," he told the Daily Politics.  "I think our inquiry will prove that, hopefully prove precisely how they've interfered. The FCA hasn't reached its own conclusions, it's been told what to do - it's been told via the Treasury."  The Labour MP said Mr Osborne, with whom he has frequently clashed at committee hearings, wanted to "neuter" the FCA and parachute "one of his senior officials" in to run the watchdog.  The FCA is searching for a new chief executive after Martin Wheatley's departure in the autumn. Mr Wheatley, who helped set up the regulator and was perceived as being tough on the banks, had been told that his contract would not be renewed.  Ms McDermott has withdrawn her name from consideration to succeed Mr Wheatley on a permanent basis, prompting claims by the opposition that the regulator - which replaced the Financial Services Authority in 2013 - is "rudderless".  The Treasury has strongly rejected any suggestions that it was aware of or behind the FCA's decision.  Speaking on Thursday, Mr Osborne said the scrapping of the inquiry was "a completely independent decision that I had no fore-knowledge of".  He suggested that the work the inquiry was due to undertake had already been completed by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which reported in 2013 and the FCA needed new leadership "to take it into its more mature phase".	politics

Recommended weekly alcohol limits have been substantially reduced and health officials now say there is no such thing as a safe level of drinking.  Mr Farage conceded there was a problem with a "binge drinking mentality".  But he said people should be able to enjoy a drink or two whether "it slightly shortens our lives or not".  Mr Farage has traded on his "man in the pub" reputation during his political career, frequently being pictured with a pint in his hand during campaigning or after election victories and describing every pub as a Parliament where political views are formed and exchanged.  The UKIP leader told LBC Radio that he was dismayed by the new guidelines, joking that he was now "25% more likely to die" than before.  Following its first full review of alcohol guidelines since 1995, the government now says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.  The previous guidance set out daily drinking limits of three to four units for men and two to three for women. The UK's chief medical officers say new research shows any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of cancer.  Mr Farage said he was upset "to turn on the news this morning and hear some appalling puritanical figure telling us no level of drinking is safe".  "I think what we ought to do is have a mass protest against this form of nannying and we should all come out at lunch and have a glass of something."  The UKIP leader acknowledged there was a problem was excessive alcohol consumption in the UK but people should be trusted to know their limits.  "Even intelligent youngsters go out on a Friday night with the intention of getting hammered, we know that. But, frankly, if we choose to enjoy a few drinks four or five nights a week after a hard day at work whether it slightly shortens our lives or not, so what.  "Do what you enjoy - and I think to basically tell us that any form of drinking is likely to lead to our death is just so over the top that we will probably behave in the opposite way. I certainly will at midday today."  The new guidance suggests that if people drink, it should be moderately over three or more days and that some days should be alcohol-free. People should not "save up" their units and drink them all in one or two goes while pregnant women should not drink at all.  How the advice has changed  Previous government guidance set out daily drinking limits of three to four units for men and two to three for women. The new guidance moves to weekly limits to get away from the idea that drinking every day is fine.  The new 14 units limit therefore represents a cut in drinking levels for both men and women, although since 1995 doctors' groups have been advising that over the course of a week men should limit themselves to 21 units and women 14 units - the lower end of the daily range the government has been advising. So in effect the government guidance has caught up with the medical advice - and gone a bit further.  On drinking in pregnancy, the new advice is unambiguous. Women should not drink. Previously women in Wales, Northern Ireland and England had been told not to drink but if they did to limit it.  The latest guidance makes it clear people should be teetotal on some days and that heavy drinking sessions should be avoided. The 1995 did not set this out categorically.	politics

It has fallen to as low as -11C in the region.  The medical charities International Medical Corps and Medecins Sans Frontieres say most patients are suffering with respiratory problems such as bronchitis and flu.  There are also concerns about people refusing or not seeking treatment.  Migrants are offered medical assistance, warm clothes and food at the main refugee points at the Serbian border with Macedonia to the south, and Croatia to the north.  International Medical Corps runs a makeshift clinic at the train station in the tiny town of Sid, in northern Serbia.  "Last week, when temperatures were a bit less, we were seeing around 50 to 60 people a day," said Sanja Djurica, IMC team leader.  "This week, now that temperatures have fallen, it's more like 100 or so a day."  "Almost all of them are suffering with respiratory illnesses brought on by the cold."  I met the Al-Maari family, who are making the journey as the snow falls thick and fast. They fled Syria three weeks ago, and have been on the road ever since.  They are travelling with four children, the youngest is just two years old. His brother Mohammad, seven, is suffering with fever and a chest infection.  "We are on a journey of death," said Mohammad's uncle, Iyad Al-Maari.  "We can endure. But I am worried about the children - the cold, disease and hunger."  Mohammad is not thought to be seriously ill. Iyad said the family are determined to continue to Germany, where the children's father is waiting for them.  "Some people are refusing further medical help after we've assessed them," said Tuna Turkman from MSF in Serbia.  "Even if they are referred to hospital, most don't go. They just want to keep moving... in case borders suddenly close and they are left stranded."  With tears in her eyes, Mohammad's mother, Malak, said: "We didn't want any of this… we just want the war to end in Syria."  The stress and anxiety can be seen clearly on Malak's face. She is traumatised and desperate.  Medics have also highlighted the enormous psychological impact on those making these journeys.  International Medical Corps has psychologists on hand in Sid, and even though people only tend to stay there for a few hours, medics and aid workers do have some time to deliver "psychological first aid".  "It's emotional comfort, empathetic listening and encouraging coping techniques," said Sanja Djurica.  "They are grateful just to have someone who will listen to them."	health

University of Southampton researchers said their findings added weight to evidence that inflammation in the brain is what drives the disease.  A drug used to block the production of these microglia cells in the brains of mice had a positive effect.  Experts said the results were exciting and could lead to new treatments.  Up until now, most drugs used to treat dementia have targeted amyloid plaques in the brain which are a characteristic of people with the Alzheimer's disease.  But this latest study, published in the journal Brain, suggests that in fact targeting inflammation in the brain, caused by a build-up of immune cells called microglia, could halt progression of the disease.  Previous studies have also suggested that these cells could play an important role.  Dr Diego Gomez-Nicola, lead study author from the university, said: "These findings are as close to evidence as we can get to show that this particular pathway is active in the development of Alzheimer's disease.  "The next step is to work closely with our partners in industry to find a safe and suitable drug that can be tested to see if it works in humans."  In the mice which were given a drug to block a receptor - called CSF1R - responsible for the rise in microglia in their brains, fewer memory and behavioural problems were noted in the study.  The drug also prevented the loss of communication points between nerve cells in the brain which usually happens in people with Alzheimer's.  Dr Mark Dallas, lecturer in cellular and molecular neuroscience at the University of Reading, said this was "an exciting discovery" which could explain "why drugs designed to treat Alzheimer's have so far been unsuccessful".  He added: "While this basic science research provides strong evidence, the challenge will now be to develop medicines for people with dementia, so we await the development of clinical treatments with interest. Too often, this has been the stumbling block in turning observations in the laboratory into a workable therapy."  Dr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, said the study findings were "encouraging".  "With an ageing population and no new dementia drugs in over a decade, the need to find treatments that can slow or stop disease progression is greater than ever."	health

Transcripts of candid conversations between the former US president and the ex-UK prime minister have been published following a BBC FOI request.  They start with Mr Clinton congratulating Mr Blair on his 1997 general election victory.  Soon afterwards, Mr Blair is already targeting a second term in office.  "We are having a hell of a time getting under way - the honeymoon doesn't last long," he said as Mr Clinton attended a meeting of his new Cabinet.  "The second term is what we need; to take nothing for granted and not rely on the other side's unpopularity."  In a conversation straight after Labour's election victory, Mr Clinton commiserates with Mr Blair for "getting so much grief with the press".  "Always the Right attack you and the Left don't defend you," Mr Blair replies.  The transcripts of calls and meetings between the two leaders also cover the Northern Ireland peace process and the death of Princess Diana, as documented in a blog by BBC Freedom of Information specialist Martin Rosenbaum.  They have been released by the Clinton Presidential Library, which stores the records of his presidency.  In one conversation, Mr Clinton praises Gordon Brown, then Mr Blair's chancellor, at a meeting of international finance ministers.  "He was terrific, you would have been really proud of him," he says.  When the US president speaks of his affection for Durham Cathedral, Mr Blair says: "I was a choirboy at the cathedral in Durham, if you can believe that."

Mr Cameron said it would be better not to have to resort to new taxes but said that "what matters is we do make progress" on obesity.  The PM was speaking to journalists following reports a tax on sugary drinks was being considered.  Number 10 previously said he "doesn't see a need for a tax on sugar".  In October a report by Public Health England recommended a tax of between 10 and 20% on high-sugar products as one of the measures needed to achieve a "meaningful" reduction in sugar consumption.  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has also campaigned for such a move, while a new study in the British Medical Journal said Mexico's sugary drinks tax led to a 12% reduction in sales.  Asked at a press conference in Hungary whether he was ready to reverse his previous opposition to the policy, Mr Cameron said: "I don't really want to put new taxes onto anything but we do have to recognise that we face potentially in Britain something of an obesity crisis when we look at the effect of obesity on not just diabetes but the effect on heart disease, potentially on cancer."  The PM said the government would come up with a "fully worked-up programme" to tackle obesity, with details announced later this year.  He added: "We shouldn't be in the business of ruling things out but obviously putting extra taxes on things is not something I aim to do, it's something I would rather avoid."  A Downing Street spokeswoman said more needed to be done to reduce obesity and urged the food and drink industry to develop more alternative products that do not have high sugar levels.  The Food and Drink Federation has said it does not agree evidence supports the introduction of a tax on sugary products and that industry is "determined" to help tackle childhood obesity.	politics

The former London Mayor told the BBC's Daily Politics Nato membership would be one of the issues his review would probably be looking at.  Labour put out a statement afterwards saying it was not part of the review.  Nato is a military alliance between the US and European nations founded in 1949 to counter any Soviet Union threat.  In his Daily Politics interview, Mr Livingstone questioned the 29 nation organisation's role in the modern world, saying: "My main view on this is that it doesn't really matter whether you're in Nato or not terribly much because the Cold War is over.  "If we're to stay in Nato, the question is what's its role? Invading more countries in the Middle East? I'm not in favour of that."  He denied he had already made up his mind about replacing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons, one of the main issues the review will be looking at.  He told the programme he could back Trident renewal if someone could persuade him it was vital for the UK's security.  But he said America and Russia had "vast arsenals" when it came to nuclear weapons while the UK and France were just "side shows".  He said it would be "suicide" to launch an attack on Russia, saying the UK only had "enough to start a war, not to win a war".  Conservative MP Julian Lewis, chairman of the defence select committee, said Mr Livingstone was wrong to call the UK a "side show" when it came to amount of nuclear weapons it possessed. He said "we can inflict unacceptable damage" on other countries.  He denied renewing Trident would make the UK part of the nuclear arms race, saying the UK had the minimum amount to protect its security.	politics

But are low-calorie sweeteners the guilt-free way to be naughty?  Nobody is going to claim that regularly drinking full-sugar pop is good for you with a 500ml bottle of cola containing around 200 calories.  But a diet version can come in at just the one calorie.  Simple logic would suggest that swapping a full sugar drink for a diet version cuts calories from your diet.  And yet such drinks have a mixed reputation. There is public concern about some sweeteners and groups of scientists have argued that low-calorie sweeteners may lead to weight gain and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  So do they have a place in our shopping baskets?  "A lot of people assume they must be healthy choices because they are not sugared beverages, but the critical thing for people to understand is we don't have the evidence," said Prof Susan Swithers, from the US's Purdue University.  Studies looking at large groups of people have shown obese people tend to drink more fizzy diet drinks than those of a healthy weight.  A study of US adults in the American Journal of Public Health showed 11% who were a healthy weight, 19% of those who were overweight and 22% who were obese drank diet beverages.  And a study in the journal Obesity that followed 3,700 people for eight years showed those consuming the low-calorie sweeteners put on the most weight.  The researchers were left asking the question: "Are artificial sweeteners fuelling, rather than fighting, the very epidemic they were designed to block?"  But it is impossible to determine cause and effect in such studies. Are the drinks causing weight gain or are obese people turning to diet drinks in an effort to control their weight?  Prof Swithers' experiments on rats suggest the drinks alter the way the body deals with normal sugar, which could lead to weight-gain.  When sugar hits the tongue it gives us that delicious hit of sweetness, but also tells the body that food is on the way.  But with zero-calorie sweeteners that same message is sent, but no food arrives. The argument is the link between sweetness and calories has been broken.  Prof Swithers told me: "We think the diet sodas may be bad because they make it hard to deal with the sugar you are consuming.  "When the animals get real sugar they're not as good at processing it, their hormonal responses get blunted, their blood sugar levels go up and it leads to weight gain."  She also points out another problem - compensation. When you know you are taking calories out of one part of your diet you tend to eat more somewhere else.  "I had a diet beverage therefore I can have a cookie," she said - it's the same effect that has been well documented after we hit the gym.  Aspartame is one of the best known low-calorie sweeteners, but is also the most controversial.  The sugar substitute, also known as E951 in Europe, is 200 times sweeter than sugar and has been linked to a series of scare stories since it was introduced to foods in the 1980s.  Pepsi quoted public distrust in the stuff as the number one reason people were ditching their diet soda in the US.  It is often described one of the most tested food ingredient in the world.  And a review by the European Food Safety Authority in 2013 concluded that there were "no safety concerns" including for pregnant women and for children.  Meanwhile scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel showed that low-calorie sweeteners altered the balance of bacteria inside the guts of rats.  Our body's cells are outnumbered 10-to-one by bacteria, viruses and fungi growing on or in us and this "microbiome" has a huge impact on health.  The study, in the journal Nature, showed that low-calorie sweeteners altered the animals' metabolism and led to higher blood sugar levels - an early sign of developing type 2 diabetes.  Seven human volunteers then spent seven days consuming very high levels of low-calorie sweeteners. In half of people the results mirrored those in the animals.  But Prof Peter Rogers, from the University of Bristol, is far from convinced by such studies.  He says most of the animal research used levels of sweeteners that showed "little relation" to how they are used in real life.  And that it was "equally plausible" that low calorie sweeteners "may actually decrease one's desire for a sweet dessert".  Watch: How healthy is your breakfast?  Read: Low-fat or high-fat - does it matter?  Read: Is butter back and is saturated fat good for you?  Prof Rogers was part of a review, which included researchers funded by the food industry, of the evidence on low-energy sweeteners.  The results, published in the International Journal of Obesity, showed people lost weight when asked to replace sugary drinks with low-calorie sweetened ones.  It showed they lost around 1.2kg on average when people were on the diet for between four and 40 months - an effect broadly the same as for switching to water.  Prof Rogers said: "We clearly found that consuming low-calorie sweeteners, in place of sugar, reduced energy intake and body weight."  And that while people consuming sweeteners did end up eating more than those who stuck to sugary drinks, they still consumed fewer calories overall.  He concludes: "They're not going to do all the work for you, but it's a way to enjoy the pleasure of sweet, without the penalty of calories in our obesogenic society."  Although experts say that in an ideal world we'd all be drinking water, a study in Obesity journal even suggests "pre-loading" with water half an hour before eating actually helps people lose weight.  But even staunch critic of low-calorie sweeteners, Prof Swithers, argues they may have a role as a halfway house.  "A diet beverage would be useful to have in your diet as a transition, so if you're drinking regular soda every day and find it too difficult to stop," she said.  They should help with some weight-loss, at least in the short-term. The big question is whether we'd all be better off by just adjusting to a diet that's less sweet.	health

If current trends continue, experts say, almost three in four adults could be overweight or obese by 2035, bringing a host of health issues.  The Cancer Research UK and UK Health Forum report calls for a 21:00 cut-off time for TV adverts for unhealthy food.  Health officials say they are committed to tackling childhood obesity.  Recent studies suggest obesity is linked to several cancers - including oesophageal (gullet), womb, and bowel tumours.  And being overweight has long been associated with conditions such as diabetes and coronary heart disease.  In this study, researchers used a computer modelling system, together with historical and current health data, to predict the impact of obesity over the next 20 years.  Their work suggests a rise in the number of people who are overweight or obese would contribute to 4.6 million additional cases of type-2 diabetes and 1.6 million extra cases of heart disease by 2035.  And experts estimate this could lead to an additional £2.5bn in costs to the NHS for 2035 alone.  The report recommends a number of ways to tackle this problem, including introducing a 20p per litre tax on sugary drinks and a review of how food is advertised online.  Experts behind the report say they have taken into account that increases in obesity have started to slow in the past few years.  But they also say one of the major challenges they faced was an inability to take major future changes - such as new drugs or technologies - into account.  Prof Susan Jebb, at the University of Oxford, said while interventions to curb obesity were welcome, the report overlooked the need to fund support for people who were already overweight.  She added: "Most people know that smoking causes cancer, but fortunately, most people in the UK now don't smoke. And for them, managing their weight is the single most important thing they can do to reduce their risk of cancer."  Department of Health officials said they had already brought in a ban on adverts featuring junk food during children's TV programmes and would be launching a childhood obesity strategy shortly.  There are a number of theories behind the link, including:	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35239232	Labour reshuffle: Shadow ministers quit in protest	Three Labour MPs have quit the party's front bench in protest at sackings made by Jeremy Corbyn in his reshuffle.  Jonathan Reynolds and Stephen Doughty quit over the sacking of the shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden.  Mr Corbyn fired Mr McFadden over "disloyalty" after he appeared to criticise his stance on terrorism.  Kevan Jones has quit his defence role over Trident after Mr Corbyn replaced pro-nuclear weapons MP Maria Eagle with unilateralist Emily Thornberry.  Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn - who also disagrees with Mr Corbyn on key issues including bombing IS targets in Syria - escaped the axe in the shake-up.  He denied he had been "muzzled" by Mr Corbyn after reportedly agreeing not to criticise the leader's policy positions from the front bench, saying he would be carrying on with his job "exactly as before".  The only changes in the shadow cabinet see anti-Trident MP Emily Thornberry replacing shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle, who moves to culture to replace sacked Michael Dugher.  But the moves have sparked a string of departures in the junior ranks.  In his resignation letter, Mr Reynolds backed comments by Mr McFadden in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, in which he criticised the response of the Stop the War coalition, which Mr Corbyn used to chair.  Mr McFadden said Mr Corbyn had told him he thought his comments were "an attack on him and that he had come to the conclusion because of that and one or two other things that I shouldn't continue".  "He clearly feels that me saying terrorists are entirely responsible for their action, that no-one forces anyone to kill innocent people in Paris, to blow up the London Underground, to behead innocent aid workers, that when I say they are entirely responsible for that, he clearly interpreted that as an attack on him," he added.  Shadow foreign minister Stephen Doughty - who announced his resignation on the BBC's Daily Politics - said Mr McFadden had been "singled out for punishment for speaking with honesty and principle".  MPs Wes Streeting, John Woodcock and Jamie Reed were among others to criticise Mr McFadden's sacking on Twitter.  John McDonnell suggested in a BBC News Channel interview that Hilary Benn could emulate himself and Mr Corbyn, who spent their lengthy careers to this point speaking from the back benches, often against their party leader.  Not to be uncharitable to the pair, but hardly anyone in the media was interested when they did it. But if a senior figure like Mr Benn did it, it would almost certainly become the story. Conservative MPs would be beside themselves with glee.  Kevan Jones who last year clashed with Ken Livingstone, when the anti-nuclear former mayor was put in joint charge of Labour's defence review, said he "respected" Mr Corbyn's view that Britain's nuclear deterrent should be scrapped, but disagreed and could no longer remain as shadow defence minister.  He described Ms Thornberry's appointment as a mistake, saying it left the party's defence policy "controlled by the North London Labour party".  But Ms Thornberry, the MP for Islington South, defended her suitability for the role and promised that, while she had clear personal views on Trident, she would lead a "truly open review" on the UK's nuclear deterrent.  In an interview with the British Forces Broadcasting Service, she said she had "quite a lot more experience" than people were giving her credit for, pointing out she had family members in the military and a "regiment in my constituency".  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell defended the decision to sack Mr McFadden, saying there had been other "issues about loyalty" and it was not just about one Commons statement.  He told the Today programme Mr McFadden's comments had "played into an agenda which distorted Jeremy's views on how we tackle terrorism" and this had contributed to the "undermining of Jeremy's status".  Later he told Channel 4 News there was a "hard right" faction in the party which had never accepted Mr Corbyn's election victory.  At Prime Minster's Questions, David Cameron said it "speaks volumes" about Mr Corbyn's leadership that Mr McFadden should be sacked for saying terrorists should be held responsible for their actions and he questioned why Mr Benn had not quit the front bench team.  He then poked fun at Labour through the medium of Shakespeare quotes.  Responding to a question from Stratford-on-Avon Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, he said: "There was a moment when it looked like this reshuffle could go into its Twelfth Night. It was a revenge reshuffle so it was going to be As You Like It.  "I think though we can conclude it's turned into something of a Comedy Of Errors, perhaps Much Ado About Nothing? There will be those who worry Love's Labour's Lost."  The Conservatives said Labour was now a "threat to national security", citing Ms Thornberry's views on Trident and comments Mr Corbyn has made in the past about Nato and the role of the UK armed forces.  Mr McFadden is being replaced by former junior shadow education minister, Pat Glass.  There are now 17 women and 14 men in the full shadow cabinet. Elsewhere, Emma Lewell-Buck was promoted to shadow minister for devolution and local government.  Responding to comments by Labour leadership sources that he was sacked for "incompetence and disloyalty", sacked shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher tweeted that he was "not sure it's sensible for the leader and his office to get into a debate about 'loyalty' or 'competence'".  Confirming his own dismissal earlier on Tuesday, Mr Dugher - a former aide to Gordon Brown - said he had "paid the price" for speaking out in defence of colleagues whose reputations he claimed had been "trashed" by aides to Mr Corbyn.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35244484	PMQs: Corbyn clashes with Cameron over flood defences	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has clashed with the prime minister over funding for flood defence schemes.  Mr Corbyn attacked Mr Cameron's government for cancelling a scheme in Leeds and turning down applications to improve protection in York and Cumbria.  But Mr Cameron said flood relief had improved and spending on protection had increased to £2bn in England.  He said it was "laughable" to suggest Mr Corbyn would have responded to the Christmas floods more quickly.  December was the wettest month on record in the UK, with about 16,000 homes in England flooded, and Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire among the worst affected.  Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland also saw flooding and damage from a series of storms, including Desmond, Eva and Frank.  More heavy rain is expected overnight and on Thursday and could cause further flooding, the Environment Agency for England and Wales is warning.  It comes as MPs on the Commons Environment Committee were told by Environment Agency bosses that flood defences saved lives and did not fail during December's storms.  Mr Corbyn questioned whether the government had learnt from flooding in January 2014.  Mr Cameron said "a number of lessons have been learnt", adding: "This time the military came in far faster than ever before, the Bellwin Scheme [financial assistance scheme] was funded at 100% not 85%, more money got to communities more quickly."  He said there was "always" more to learn, adding: "That is why we will review everything that's been done. But let's be clear as we do that that we will make money available."  Mr Corbyn attacked the government for cancelling funding for flood protection schemes.  "One thousand homes and businesses in Leeds were flooded in recent weeks [and] the government is still only committed to a scaled-down version of the project worth a fraction of its total cost - when the prime minister claimed that money was no object when it came to flood relief," said the Labour leader.  He pressed the prime minister to guarantee full funding for a £190m project on the River Aire in Leeds that was cancelled in 2011.  And he called for a cross-party approach which would back "properly funded" flood protection schemes and upland management to make homes more resilient.  Mr Cameron said: "We are spending more on flood defence schemes and are stacking up a whole series of schemes that we'll spend more on...  "If you are going to spend billions of pounds on renationalising our railways, where are you going to find the money for flood defences?  "The idea that this individual would be faster in responding to floods when it takes him three days to carry out a [shadow cabinet] reshuffle is frankly laughable."  The Labour leader later wrote to David Cameron to seek further assurances on funding for key schemes.  In the letter, Mr Corbyn claimed Mr Cameron's remarks during Prime Minister's Questions had been "simply disingenuous" and to assert more was being spent than five years ago was a "misrepresentation" of the facts.  "As we face billions of pounds worth of flood damage, we can now tangibly see the effects of the false economy that is your government's austerity," Mr Corbyn wrote.  Over the current parliament, £2.3bn will be spent on flood defences in England.  Last year £802m was spent on flood defences, according to Defra, but the amount spent in 2015-16 is expected to decrease to £695m.  In Cumbria, £45m was spent by the government on flood defences during the last parliament, Environment secretary Liz Truss has said. A new £4.4m flood defence scheme was constructed in Cumbria in 2013, which included the UK's first "self-closing" flood barriers.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35247721	Emily Thornberry donation questions dismissed as 'smears'	Friends of Emily Thornberry have said questions over donations she was given by a law firm are a "desperate smear".  The new shadow defence secretary got funding for a legal research assistant from Leigh Day to support her work when she was shadow attorney general.  Leigh Day has been referred to a legal tribunal for its role in representing Iraqis allegedly mistreated by UK troops during the Iraq war.  The Labour MP declared each donation at the time they were received.  According to Parliament's register of interests, Leigh Day funded three secondments worth a total of £48,125 between 2012 and 2014.  Two other law firms also provided funding for a similar research role during that period.  During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said there were "questions to answer" over the Leigh Day donations, while Labour MP John Mann has suggested Ms Thornberry should return what he described as "vested interest money".  Friends of Ms Thornberry said that soldiers pursuing claims against the Ministry of Defence were among Leigh Day's many clients, who also included people suffering from the effects of the drug thalidomide, for whom the prime minister called for extra support on Wednesday.  In an interview with British Forces Broadcasting Services marking her appointment, Ms Thornberry said Leigh Day was an "outstanding" firm and the allegations against it "had nothing to do with any of the outstanding youngsters who gave their time to help us out here".  Leigh Day, she said, had offered "some of their brightest and best to help make sure the opposition had proper legal advice".  Leigh Day was referred on Tuesday to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal to answer complaints about its handling of legal challenges brought by Iraqi detainees against the Ministry of Defence.  It follows the findings of the 2014 Al-Sweady inquiry, which concluded that the most serious claims against British soldiers had been "deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility".  The firm has said the decision to refer it to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal was "premature".  It has strongly denied allegations of wrongdoing, which, it said, it had not been given adequate time to respond to.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35244777	Could Hilary Benn really be on the front and backbenches?	Could shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn really speak from the back benches next time he disagrees with Jeremy Corbyn?  Hilary Benn made a barnstorming speech in favour of bombing Syria, while his boss Jeremy Corbyn, who disagreed with him, sat rather stony faced on the front bench behind him. Even though Labour MPs had been given a "free vote" on the issue, to allow the expression of opposing views, it screamed "split". A majority of Labour MPs voted with Corbyn, but Benn got a rare round of applause in the Commons and the plaudits of the nation's media pundits.  After much tortuous reshuffle negotiation, and speculation that he would be sacked, a compromise appeared to have been reached with Mr Benn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the Today programme: "When it comes down to future debates we won't have a situation where he will be speaking from the front bench when there is a major disagreement on policy and where the Parliamentary Labour Party is in the majority against him." Mr Corbyn will speak from the front bench and "if there is a disagreement and people on a free vote want to express their views, they will do it from the back benches," he explained.  Hilary Benn insists he hasn't been "muzzled" and his team are briefing that there has been no deal. It is also worth stressing that it would that it would only apply in free votes, which are pretty rare. In a normal whipped vote, any shadow minister who fancied speaking out against the leader's position, would still have to resign or be sacked. Those are the rules.  It is not unprecedented for ministers, or shadow ministers, to speak from the backbenches, but it is normally on constituency matters or issues that are not part of their brief. No one can recall a frontbencher returning temporarily to the back benches to make a speech on something that they are meant to be leading on.  John McDonnell suggested in a BBC News Channel interview that Mr Benn could emulate himself and Mr Corbyn, who spent their lengthy careers to this point speaking from the back benches, often against their party leader. Not to be uncharitable to the pair, but hardly anyone in the media was interested when they did it. But if a senior figure like Mr Benn did it, it would almost certainly become the story. Conservative MPs would be beside themselves with glee.  David Cameron has decided to give his ministers the freedom to campaign for either side in the EU referendum in "a personal capacity". No one has said anything about Tory ministers making speeches on Europe from the back benches, if they disagree with the government's official view, but it would be one way round the problem....	politics

And for hours, we learnt nothing.  A passing Conservative MP, who is pregnant, suggested her labour might be over before Labour's reshuffle was.  One of my Twitter followers suggested the DFS sale might even have finished by the time we heard any news.  Half a dozen of us doing what comes best to reporters.  Hanging around doing nothing.  Another offered the use of his office kettle.  On the walls around us, pictures of senior politicians down the ages.  I had Frederick North, the Second Earl of Guilford (ED: this is correct spelling), for company, prime minister from 1770-1782, apparently.  I wonder what he would have made of it all.  Twitter might have taken some explaining to the Earl for a start.  Occasionally there would be flurry of excitement as the lift went past.  The good news is it was a glass lift.  The bad news is it zipped past rather quickly.  Then, just before midnight, what counted for a dramatic development.  He was going to bed.  We still didn't have any news.  And, when it came, it wasn't so much the Night of the Long Knives as just a Very Long Night.  Very little actually changed.  Both this and the time the reshuffle took are indications of Mr Corbyn's limited room for manoeuvre.  "We never intended to have a Big Bang," Labour sources insisted.  With more than a hint of the absurd, us stairwell dwellers were then invited in for a briefing, well after midnight.  I've been to "early morning" briefings before, but this was a new spin on that genre.  In the briefing, Labour sources, as I'm obliged to call them, were clear about Jeremy Corbyn's goal: greater coherence on policy and less tolerance for what one called "abuse" from his colleagues.  And yet, take a look to the language used to justify the sacking of shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher: he was branded not just "disloyal" but "incompetent."  Mr Dugher told me it wasn't sensible for the leader's office to get into a debate with him about "loyalty" or "competence."  Pat McFadden, who had been shadow Europe minister, was "serially disloyal," sources said.  Friends of Mr McFadden expressed their anger, with one suggesting the Labour Party was being "driven off a cliff."  There's been a coarsening of language within the Labour movement in recent months when parts of it choose to describe their colleagues.  And this reshuffle has done nothing to change that.  It's also done nothing to change Jeremy Corbyn's fundamental challenge, of which this was just the latest case study: how does he square managing a party where plenty of his party members love him, but plenty of his MPs think he's a nightmare?  But, thankfully, my stairwell loitering does not.	politics

So what is the science - is butter back? Or were those headlines a little premature?	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34846832	Diet debate: Is butter back and is sat fat good?	I love butter - a scraping of it on a slice of toast is a thing of joy.  So when a series of newspaper headlines declared saturated fat is not as bad as once thought and that "butter is back" then wow that's the kind of news story I can get behind!  But they do run against decades of health advice to cut the amount of sat fat we eat.  So what's going on here and what should make it into the supermarket trolley?  One of the big problems seems to be that simply declaring saturated fat is bad or that butter is back loses all nuance.  The World Health Organization's advice is to have no more than 10% of total calories coming from saturated fat.  The argument has been that sat fat increases the amount of bad cholesterol in the blood, although it also increases the good type too.  The bad cholesterol furs up arteries and ultimately leads to a heart attack or stroke. Meanwhile trials of statins show cholesterol-lowering drugs can reduce the risk of a heart attack.  Watch: How healthy is your breakfast?  Read: Low-fat or high-fat - does it matter?  But getting the best evidence in nutrition is always a bit of nightmare.  Some studies rely on food questionnaires asking people what they ate in the past year and then seeing what happened decades later. Now I can't tell you what I had for dinner three weeks ago and diets also change with time.  And it's ever so slightly unethical to lock people up and experiment with their diets for decades to see if they have a heart attack. So the evidence ends up being a patchwork quilt of studies that gives an overall impression that saturated fat is bad.  Public Health England, which advises people to cut down on saturated fat, says one of the key pieces of science on which they base their recommendations on is a review of 15 clinical trials which changed more than 59,000 people's diets for at least two years.  However, even this starts to show why there can be confusion about saturated fat.  It showed no impact on deaths from heart disease or any other cause of dying.  And the analysis concludes that if you cut saturated fat out of your diet and replace it with carbohydrates or protein then it makes no difference to your risk of a heart attack.  Carbs, and especially the refined ones in white bread rather than the complex ones in vegetables or wholegrains, are as bad for you as the saturated fat we've been warned off for years.  It is only when saturated fats are replaced like-for-like by polyunsaturated fats that you see a significant reduction in heart attacks.  Dr Lee Hooper, who led the study at the University of East Anglia, said: "What we've realised in the last few years is that saturated fat isn't quite as much a villain as we thought."  Saturated fat - Found in meats including processed foods such as burgers and sausages as well as butter, dairy and coconut oil  Monounsaturated fat - Found in avocados, olive oil, and many types of nut.  I put it to Public Health England's chief nutritionist, Dr Alison Tedstone, that just telling people to cut saturated fat was too simplistic.  She was adamant that saturated fat is a bad thing in our diets but "it's a fair point that sometimes the fat message gets oversimplified".  Dr Tedstone continued: "The data over the years has flip-flopped slightly as new studies have emerged and that's because you're looking at subtle things on whether it should be monos or polys or wholegrain carbohydrate.  "I agree it's inappropriate to give the population messages to increase your carbohydrate intake without thinking about what that carbohydrate intake is."  The advice from both Drs Tedstone and Hooper is to cook in sunflower oil instead of butter and have a low-fat spread.  But some have argued that even this is wrong and that butter and other foods rich in saturated fat belong in a healthy diet.  A study by the University of Cambridge in 2014 is often quoted after it concluded there was no "clearly supportive evidence" for the guidelines that encourage cutting saturated fat from the diet.  It led to a flurry of headlines announcing that "butter is back".  "That is an oversimplification, we never said that," one of the researchers Dr Nita Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge, told me.  The review did show no significant relationship between the amount of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat or a type of polyunsaturated fat and heart disease.  But Dr Forouhi warned there needed to be a stronger focus on not what should be cut from the diet, but with what it should be replaced.  The study could not take that into account.  She said saturated fat had become a "very, very reductionist debate" and warned people to "be careful about giving oversimplified messages".  But she is at the forefront of research that might transform the saturated fat debate, bringing some saturated fats in from the cold.  Once upon a time doctors thought all "cholesterol" was bad, until they discovered it came in both "good" and "bad" forms.  Well, now there is a growing realisation that not all saturated fats are the same and emerging evidence hints that some types may be beneficial.  A saturated fatty acid is a string of carbon atoms chained together, but the length of the chain varies.  Saturated fatty acids range from those with four carbons (butyric acid) to those with 24 carbons (lignoceric acid). Common ones include palmitic acid (16 carbons) and stearic acid (18 carbons).  When you look at the levels of the different saturated fatty acids that end up in the blood then interesting patterns start to emerge.  People with higher levels of 16 and 18 carbon saturated fatty acids in the bloodstream had a higher risk of heart disease.  But those with more saturated fatty acids with a length of 15 or 17, which is linked to eating dairy, had a lower risk and the same pattern emerges in type 2 diabetes.  "These are very exciting findings and could really advance our understanding," added Dr Forouhi.  So-called "even-chain" saturated fatty acids such as those with 16 carbons come from dietary fat, but are also made by the body because of high intakes of refined carbs and alcohol.  So not only could refined carbs be having a negative effect on blood sugar levels, they could also be boost "bad" saturated fats in the blood.  The "odd-chains" come exclusively from the diet and notably from dairy products.  And Dr Forouhi added: "Our new findings may also help to explain the reports from studies that some types of dairy products may cut diabetes or heart disease risk, somewhat contrary to expectation."  But wait a minute - were all those headlines right? Should cheese, yoghurt, whole milk and butter should be firmly on the menu?  Dr Forouhi warned that it was dangerous to take her early evidence and make such pronouncements.  "We cannot assume that the beneficial effects of dairy products are solely from the 'good' saturated fatty acids, after all foods contain a combination of ingredients."  She warned there was still a "powerful link" between butter or saturated fat and bad cholesterol and more targeted studies should now take place on sub-types of saturated fat.  And specifically on butter she said that most scientific studies don't actually include it in their definition of dairy.  More research in this whole field is taking place, it could dramatically change our understanding of fat. Or equally it could come to nothing.  Dr Forouhi concluded: "While that research is going on I don't think we should just go changing everything.  "It's too premature to give the public the impression that they have a licence, based on this preliminary research, which is exciting but not yet definitive, to say butter is back."	health

The Sheffield Hallam University team, backed by Cancer Research UK, have a hunch that physical activity can help the body stop tumours from spreading.  They are asking 50 men with prostate cancer that has not yet spread to put the theory to the test for 12 months.  They hope to show that aerobic exercise is a treatment in its own right and should be offered on the NHS.  Half of the men will have weekly supervised exercise sessions, while the other 25 will only be given information about the benefits of exercise for cancer patients.  The researchers will be monitoring the men closely and will check their blood for levels of a protein called PSA, which can help show if prostate cancer is growing and spreading.  If the results are promising and the men can stick with the exercise regime, the researchers say they will do a larger, full-scale trial.  Study leader Dr Liam Bourke said: "It's early days yet, but the data that we do have suggests that exercise may actually be beneficial in terms of helping regulate the way that cancer cells grow and repair DNA.  "It builds on what we already know and is the first step towards finding out whether exercise could be an effective and practical NHS treatment for localised prostate cancer."  Prof Malcolm Mason, of Cancer Research, UK said: "Taking exercise is good for all of us, whether or not we have cancer - but this interesting study could help discover whether it's particularly helpful and a viable, additional treatment for some prostate cancer patients."	health

Mr Lamb will raise the issue in Parliament on Wednesday, warning that the systems could crash without action.  He said even the promises of extra money for the NHS were not enough.  Ministers have pledged £8.4bn above inflation by 2020.  But Mr Lamb said that would still leave the health service short with a growing number of hospitals struggling with deficits and to keep pace with demand.  And he said that was before the state of social care was taken into account. He claimed those services, paid for by councils, were on the brink with concerns that a number of care home providers were set to leave the market.  "The reality is that we will either see the system effectively crash or we confront the existential crisis now. This transcends party politics."  He said the commission should look at everything from increasing taxes - as he has pushed for - to ending the "artificial divide" between health and care.  The MP, who served as a health minister under the coalition, will call for the cross-party commission in a 10-minute rule bill - a device by which backbenchers can propose legislation.  Mr Dorrell, who is now chairman of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, and was health secretary in John Major's government, said he supported Mr Lamb's bid.  He predicted the problems being experienced now would "only get worse" in the next decade.	health

About 568,000 people have backed a petition calling on the tycoon to be barred for comments he made about banning Muslims from the US.  Labour MP Paul Flynn will lead a debate in Westminster Hall on 18 January.  David Cameron has condemned Mr Trump, who has major business interests in the UK, but said he should be allowed in.  The Commons petitions committee decided to hold a debate on the issue after considering the matter at a meeting on Tuesday. Under the current rules, MPs have to consider any petition with 100,000 signatures for discussion in Parliament.  The debate will be held in the Commons' secondary debating chamber rather than the full chamber and there will be no vote at the end of it.  Helen Jones, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it would allow for "a range of views" to be expressed.  "By scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the UK," she said.  "As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated."  But Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron questioned the decision to allocate parliamentary time to discussing Mr Trump.  He tweeted: "Trump is a bloviating billionaire with downright offensive views. But I'd rather we debated inequality or the NHS."  Mr Trump is currently the frontrunner, in some opinion polls, for the Republican nomination but he has been roundly criticised for comments he made about Muslims in the wake of December's fatal San Bernardino shootings - remarks which critics said were offensive and inflammatory.  Home Secretary Theresa May, who makes decisions on banning orders, has said she cannot comment on the case.  A rival petition opposing a ban on Mr Trump as illogical has been signed by nearly 40,000 people. This will also be debated by MPs.	politics

The ex-shadow culture secretary is the first - and so far only - casualty of Mr Corbyn's front bench reshuffle.  Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle has been told that she will be moved.  A planned meeting of the shadow cabinet at lunchtime was cancelled as the changes are taking longer than planned.  Mr Corbyn is continuing to hold meetings with close aides, with no indication yet about when an announcement will be made.  Mr Dugher - who ran Andy Burnham's leadership campaign - told BBC News: "I decided to speak out a number of days ago because what we've seen in recent weeks is a number of good hardworking loyal members of the shadow cabinet being systematically trashed, in terms of their reputations, in their newspapers by people in the employment of Jeremy Corbyn.  "It was de-stabilising and I felt it was right to speak out about that and I appear to have paid the price for that. But I don't regret it for one second."  He also said that the biggest casualty in the reshuffle had been the "new politics" and despite promises from the leader that there would be room for a little dissent, "the truth is that's just not transpired".  The sacking of the Barnsley East MP, a close ally of former leader Gordon Brown who is known for his combative style, has been met with dismay by senior Labour figures.  Shadow defence minister Toby Perkins said: "Sad to hear this, always effective at putting Tories on the back foot, something we need to do more of."  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: "Michael Dugher is a rare politician - a talented working-class MP who hasn't lost his strong Yorkshire roots.  "Politicians with his ability and commitment can make a difference in any role. Labour's loss in the shadow cabinet will be compensated by Michael's free thought on the backbenches."  Will this turn out to be the reshuffle that never was?  One member of the shadow cabinet said, "it was all on, and then it was all off again".  A senior Labour figure tells me now that despite the target on Hilary Benn's back, that Jeremy Corbyn has "backed down", and the shadow foreign secretary is absolutely safe in his job.  Whatever the final details today, the bigger question in the longer term is whether even the threat of sackings will change the dynamics...  There has been speculation Mr Corbyn would purge his front bench team of critical voices so that the party could have a unified position on important issues such as defence and security.  Mr Corbyn has held lengthy talks with Mr Benn, who spoke out against Mr Corbyn's position on bombing Syria, and Maria Eagle, who opposes the Labour leader on nuclear weapons.  The BBC understood on Monday evening that Mr Benn would be keeping his job, but sources have since suggested that he may yet be moved, or sacked.  A further nine shadow cabinet members voted for air strikes after Mr Corbyn was forced to allow a free vote. There is speculation that shadow ministers have threatened a mass walk out if Mr Benn was sacked.  The former London mayor, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said he did not believe the Labour leader had ever intended to sack Mr Benn and speculation about his future had been whipped up by the media.  He also suggested Mr Benn's position had become more secure because he had "stopped being quite so critical and dissident".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35233683	UK and the EU: How to make a Brexit	BBC political correspondent Carolyn Quinn explores how Britain would exit the EU if voters opt to leave in the referendum.  We don't know when David Cameron will call the EU referendum but for a BBC radio documentary, How to Make a Brexit, I examined what would happen in the days, the weeks and the months after that referendum if the British people vote to leave the EU.  We're not talking about the raging arguments over whether we would prosper or fade economically, or whether we'd make better policy choices than the bureaucrats in Brussels. We're talking about the exact steps that would need to be followed should voters favour Brexit.  Until 2007, joining the European club was assumed to be a one-way ticket. There was no formal mechanism in the rules setting out how a state could leave the European Union.  But there is now. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty sets out a road map. It boils down to a couple of deceptively simple steps. The prime minister would have to write a letter to the President of the European Council notifying him of the intention to leave. The council would appoint a lead negotiator and a negotiating team.  A two-year window to negotiate a withdrawal treaty would follow - if Britain decides it wants one. The window could be expanded by a year if necessary. Any withdrawal treaty would be concluded by the European Council through qualified majority voting and then ratified by the European Parliament and the Westminster Parliament.  Britain would be carving out an unprecedented path. No nation state has ever held a referendum and then left the EU.  But there is one part of one country that has gone through the process of getting out - Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories and the world's largest island that is not a continent. It staged a referendum in 1982 after gaining a high degree of self-government from Denmark.  Greenlanders voted 52/48 to leave the EU. There followed a series of difficult and protracted negotiations between the Greenland and Danish governments, and the Danish government and the European Commission, particularly with regard to fisheries.  I travelled to Greenland - a vast land mass that is almost entirely ice cap, with scattered settlements around the coast. There are no roads outside the capital.  On the day we landed, it was -29C. It has a population of about 56,000 - a quarter of them live in Nuuk, the capital, on the south-west coast just below the Arctic Circle.  There, I spoke to the men who led Greenland's Out campaign in the 1980s.  "I was very proud when we won our referendum in 1982. There were 500 million people in Europe, and we, in Greenland were just 50,000, but we said 'no,'" said Lars-Emil Johansen, now speaker of the Greenlandic Parliament.  Veteran activist and politician Kaj Kleist said: "I cried at that moment, when we won the referendum in 1982 I remember that the chairman of the commission Jacques Delors said tonight we just lost 60% of the EU's territory."  He explained that Greenlandic fishermen resented being told by Brussels how much fish they could take out of their own waters and watching their fish stocks being hoovered up by EU factory trawlers.  Henrik Leth, who chairs the largest privately-run fishing company in Greenland - Polar Seafood, said there was a noticeable change for the industry after leaving the EU.  "We built up, and now have a very powerful industry," he said.  Two of the biggest fisheries companies in Denmark were Greenlandic, he said, and Polar Seafood was in the top 10 in Europe.  As Henrik took me on a drive around Nuuk - with its three sets of traffic lights (the only ones in the whole of Greenland) he told me more about the deal struck with the EEC.  In return for allowing continued European access to its waters, Greenland was given tariff-free access to the Community market for fisheries products. It also got EU funding on top of the money it received and continues to receive from Denmark.  Interestingly, Henrik now wonders whether the time might be right for Greenland to consider rejoining the EU, as it would give Greenland access to even greater markets like Japan and China.  He told me "little Greenland" had very little leverage with the Chinese as a nation on its own.  "What do we have to give? I mean we can tell China we will not buy Chinese products but there are more people in an office block in Shanghai than there are in Greenland so we can't possibly put on the same sort of pressure as the European Union and other big nations can."  But he admits asking to go back into the EU would be a tricky step to take.  "It has to be analysed and will be a bitter pill to swallow but on the other hand, now we have our fishing industry they will not be able to take that away from us and go back to what it was like before 1985," said Henrik.  It took the best part of three years to negotiate Greenland's exit deal. It finally left the EU in 1985. What does that tell us about Britain's prospects?  In Britain's case, the economy is many times larger and more complex, and the responsibilities and membership of the EU have ballooned over the past 30 years. If the prime minister were to invoke Article 50 and inform the European Council of Britain's intention to leave, there would be a staggering array of issues to negotiate including:  I took a trip to the European Parliament in Brussels to ask what would happen to the UK's small army of ministers, MEPs, commissioners and civil servants working within EU institutions.  UKIP's Diane James assured me that British MEPs would fulfil their role right to the very end - even agreeing or opposing pieces of legislation that, in the end, could have no impact on a departed Britain.  I sought the advice of Stephen Booth, head of the Open Europe think tank which supports EU reform. The group organised its own day of wargames to test out some of the pinch points in any potential Brexit negotiations, and is planning another later in January.  Economist Ruth Lea and Charles Grant from the pro-EU think tank, the Centre for European Reform, disagreed over how ready the UK was for the potential negotiating task ahead.  "We don't have any trade negotiators in Whitehall - we haven't had any since 1973," said Mr Grant. "The British government would be hard-pressed to find people to do a trade negotiation. They might have to borrow civil servants from other European countries or get old people out of retirement."  But Ruth Lea insisted: "I'm not worried about that because we are very good in this country at importing talent if we want to, for example we have a Canadian as governor of the Bank of England".  Another question I pose in the documentary is about the preparedness of Whitehall for the Brexit negotiations, should they come.  Former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell believes that every civil servant will be thinking: "What if?... There will be a lot of work going on mentally, but how much they write down is a different question. That is one of the potential drawbacks of the world of Freedom of Information we live in."  And finally with a referendum due to take place at the latest by the end of 2017, could all of the detailed unravelling required in the case of a Brexit be completed in a two, or possibly three, year negotiating window?  Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe QC has his doubts, and says he would rather not see the UK stay in an unreformed EU. He believes Britain should just walk away if it hasn't reached a deal by the end of two years.  "The two-year time limit would allow the process to be completed and concluded within the current parliament," he said.  "But, if it is extended, you will then be going across into a new Parliament with a General Election and in the meantime there might be a change of government and, at minimum, the negotiation process then gets tangled up in the General Election campaign."  All depends now on the outcome of the referendum.  Lord O'Donnell said in the end Britain and the EU would have to work out ways of co-existing.  Divorce can sometimes be painful, he said, but it did not have to be messy. The secret to breaking up is the same for states as for people - good planning, good sense and an ability to learn how to live and trade together in a shrinking world.

The Tory MP was reacting to claims he had tried to make an issue of Mr Khan's Muslim faith by describing him in a leaflet as "radical and divisive".  Mr Goldsmith said he had been referring to the "extraordinarily radical" changes that have happened to Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.  Mr Goldsmith said Mr Khan had nominated Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership and had been selected as the party's mayoral candidate by the "same voters" - and had been part of the same "radical process".  "If I cannot use the term radical to describe what has happened to the Labour Party... then I don't know when I would be able to use the term," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  He added: "I think he is playing with fire. I don't think there is anything more divisive than playing the race card, when, clearly and unambiguously, it does not apply.  "It 's very obvious that what I was referring to when I described him as a radical candidate as part of a radical process that has enveloped the Labour Party and taken our politics in an extraordinary direction."  But Mr Khan's team hit back by accusing the Conservative candidate of "dog whistle" politics - sending coded racist messages to voters.  A spokesman said: "It was the Goldsmith campaign which put out the infamous dog-whistle leaflet branding Sadiq as 'radical' just because he happens to be a Muslim.  "And it was Goldsmith's campaign which had to launch an investigation after alleged racist remarks from a Tory canvasser to a voter.  "Their campaign is already so desperate.... they simply have no answers to the challenges London faces like fixing the housing crisis and keeping fares down."  Mr Khan insisted an interview with Today on Monday that he would be "my own man" if he wins the race to succeed Boris Johnson in May - and the contest would not be decided by Jeremy Corbyn's policies.  The Tooting MP, a former lawyer and the son of a bus driver, said he would not attack Mr Goldsmith over his background as the son of billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, but said voters should consider whether they wanted a mayor whose only previous "proper job" was as editor of The Ecologist magazine, founded by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith.  He said: "London is one of the leading global commercial cities in the world, so I ask the question 'Do you want as Mayor of London ... someone who has never had a proper job, someone whose only job was one given you by your uncle to run his niche magazine?"'	politics

The British Medical Association has called three-walkouts - the first next Tuesday - after talks broke down.  The action is likely to lead to thousands of non-emergency operations and hospital appointments being cancelled in the coming days.  The BMA said it had been left with no choice as the government had failed to address their concerns.  But Jeremy Hunt has maintained the action was "unnecessary" as the talks had been making progress.  "It is extremely disappointing that the BMA have chosen to take industrial action which helps no-one," he added.  The strikes were called on Monday after both sides failed to reach a deal in the contract dispute during a day of talks.  The union had until midnight to decide whether it still wanted to take industrial action - or face having to re-ballot its members.  This is because of trade union rules which only allow industrial action in set timescales and require unions to give a week's notice of any walk-out.  It comes after the British Medical Association agreed to cancel three strikes last month to re-enter talks with the government. Several weeks of negotiations took place in the lead up to Christmas and then they reconvened on Monday for another attempt.  But despite the failure to reach a deal, both sides have already indicated they want to keep talking ahead of next week's walk-out.  What exactly do junior doctors do?  How does your job compare?  BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said the union had been left with no choice but to move towards industrial action as despite the weeks of negotiations the government still was not taking their concerns "seriously".  "We sincerely regret the disruption that industrial action will cause, but junior doctors have been left with no option. It is because the government's proposals would be bad for patient care as well as junior doctors in the long-term that we are taking this stand," he added.  Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, added the news was "extremely disappointing".  "Once again patients are being caught in the middle of this bitter dispute."

The International Development Committee said it backed calls from charities for the UK to accept more unaccompanied minors as a matter of "utmost urgency".  Lone children risked being forced into prostitution or the drugs trade unless given sanctuary, the MPs said.  The UK has taken 1,000 refugees so far as part of a 20,000 five-year target.  But humanitarian campaigners say this is inadequate and that refugees already in Europe should qualify for resettlement under the UK's Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme, which is currently restricted to those in refugee camps in Syria and neighbouring countries.  Now, a campaign headed by Save The Children, urging the UK to give a safe haven to 3,000 unaccompanied children fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and other war zones has won the backing of MPs from all parties.  The cross-party committee commended the government's response so far to the refugee crisis, which it said was the worst since World War Two.  It praised the £1.1bn in humanitarian aid the UK had given to Syria and its neighbours to help the millions of people displaced by the civil war and challenged other wealthy countries to also meet their humanitarian pledges in full.  But it said more needed to be done, warning that 80% of children in Syria were in need of humanitarian assistance and the number of unaccompanied children ending up in Europe in search of safety was likely only to increase.  It was originally Save The Children which came up with the suggestion that Britain should take 3,000 Syrian children who had made it to Europe unaccompanied by adults. The charity pointed to statistics from the Italian authorities suggesting that up to 4,000 children had simply disappeared off the official radar in 2014. The fear is that these children may have been preyed upon by people-traffickers.  Previously, PM David Cameron has been set against resettling refugees from inside Europe, arguing that it is better to take people directly from the region around Syria. His logic is that if you take refugees from Europe, you might encourage more people to risk dangerous journeys in unseaworthy boats.  The UK has also given £1.1bn to the region to help improve conditions in camps near Syria's borders, in the hope that will help more refugees to stay nearer to home.  But it feels like political pressure is growing on the government to tweak its policy and to find more room for children who have already arrived on Europe's shores. Save The Children was heartened that the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, backed their proposal before Christmas.  The International Development Committee has now added its weight to the suggested plan. Officially, ministers say it is still "under discussion". They will be all too aware from an earlier episode in this crisis that photographs of vulnerable children can have a strong effect on public opinion.  Stephen Twigg, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it would welcome any commitment by ministers to meet the 3,000 figure.  "Children are clearly some of the most vulnerable refugees this crisis has created," he said. "The first refugee casualty of 2016 was a drowned two-year-old boy pulled from the sea off the Greek coast.  "Having survived the treacherous journey, there is a grave possibility that unaccompanied children become the victims of people traffickers who force them into prostitution, child labour and the drugs trade.  "This is an issue of utmost urgency."  The government has said Save the Children's proposal is "under discussion" as part of a wider review into the help given to orphans.  "What we are doing is looking at the issue of whether or not countries such as the United Kingdom should do more to help vulnerable children, particularly orphans, that arrive in Europe, as opposed to all the work we are doing to help vulnerable children in camps," a spokeswoman said.  Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted the UK's focus should continue to be on providing a "direct route" to safety for the most vulnerable Syrians and not to encourage them to make the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean by boat, which has seen hundreds perish.  As part of the UK's response, an additional 216 Syrian refugees were resettled under the VPR scheme between January 2014 and mid-2015, while the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	politics

Mr Danczuk told BBC Newsnight it was a properly declared payment for media advice and to "give ideas about what they might or might not do."  The Rochdale MP said he did not make any apologies for the arrangement.  FameFlynet describes itself as one of the most powerful photographic news agencies around the world.  Mr Danczuk said: "What I have done with that organisation is to provide media advice and give ideas about what they might or might not do and that's my choice if I want to do that type of work and I don't make any apologies for it.  "There's nothing against doing that. It provides insight, it provides some transparency in terms of my life, not anything that I have ever shied away from.  "I readily accept that I do media work of various kinds and that is all declared quite clearly in the register of members' interests."  FameFlynet said it "prides itself on helping people in the public eye to raise their media profile. We use the mainstream press to achieve this".  A spokesman said: "Our work is mainly done through clever PR and promotional activities. We do not hide this from anybody and stress to our clients that we all have to be transparent.  "Over the years we have been extremely successful in this work and feel our expertise is a benefit to our clients."  It is the latest twist in the furore surrounding Mr Danczuk, 49, who is fighting to save his career following revelations that he sent lewd messages to a 17-year-old woman.  In his Newsnight interview, Mr Danczuk apologised for his behaviour and blamed tabloid newspapers for blowing the story out of all proportion.  He said he feared his work campaigning against child sex abuse might be tarnished by the current stories around his private life but he admitted he had brought this upon himself by messaging the girl.  "It was inappropriate and I have apologised for that unreservedly. I think you have to see the context of this.  "This young woman got in touch with me some months ago, during the course of several months we had exchanges across social media, and just at a low point in my life in September she sent me some sexual texts and I responded accordingly and I shouldn't have responded. Wholly inappropriate, no doubt about that."  He added: "My credibility has been dented, I readily accept that, and I have to work harder than ever before to prove myself.  "There is a dramatic difference between what I have done, some sexting with a young woman above the legal age - nothing illegal - the police have said there is no case to answer.  "That is in sharp contrast to what I have always campaigned on, which is child sexual abuse of the most criminal nature."	politics

The strike action is likely to lead to thousands of non-emergency operations and hospital appointments being cancelled in the coming days.

The development came after both sides sat down on Monday for the first time since the Christmas break.

So they took me back and forward to the optician and specialists and then they diagnosed me with retinitis pigmentosa."  This disorder destroys the light sensitive cells in the retina - but how much and how quickly varies from person to person. In Rhian's case, it eventually made her almost completely blind.  "I think I was about four or five. I've never had any vision at night or in dim light and then, as I went through school, I had the glasses and I sat at the front because I couldn't see the board.  "It was progressive and as I went to work in a shop, checking up deliveries, I had to use a magnifier increasingly to check the delivery notes and then I couldn't read the titles of the books properly, so then they put me on to different materials, like art and stationery, because there were different shapes and sizes so I could manage with that - I could do a lot from memory."  Her sight deteriorated and around 16 years ago she lost all vision in her right eye and most of the sight in her left eye.  "In my left eye, I sort of navigate around by light. If it's bright outside I'll sort of aim for the window or if it's dark and the lights are on I'll navigate by the light bulbs, like a moth."  The problem with having no sight, she says, is that you also lose your confidence because you lose your mobility.  "I don't go out and about on my own, ever. Then around the house, the kitchen, you rely on other people to find things for you - it's very frustrating. It's simple things like shopping...clothes shopping, you don't know what you look like. It's been, maybe eight years that I've had any sort of idea of what my children look like. And I've got friends now where I've got no idea what they look like. And I certainly don't know how I've aged."  In the summer, Rhian travelled to Oxford for an operation to implant a tiny 3x3mm chip into her right eye.  The device replaces the light-sensitive retinal cells in the eye, and is connected to a tiny computer that sits underneath the skin behind the ear.  When it is switched on using a magnetic coil applied to the skin, signals travel to the optic nerve and then to the brain.  Rhian still had an intact optic nerve and all the brain wiring needed for vision, but her mind needed time to adjust to the signals it was suddenly receiving after being dormant for so long.  She explains: "It was a bit nerve-wracking. I didn't know what to expect.  "They sort of put the magnet to the little receiver there on my head and switched the receiver on. They said I might not get any sensation… and then all of a sudden within seconds there was like this flashing in my eye, which has seen nothing for over 16 years, so it was like, 'Oh my God, wow!' It was just amazing to feel that something was happening in that eye, that there was some sort of signal."  One of the first tests the doctors did was to check if Rhian could now see flashing lights on a computer screen in a dark room - she could.  "What I was seeing was sort of a line at the top of my eye and at the bottom. But it was getting quite distracting because it was quite a slow flash really, so I asked them if they'd change the frequency. Now I've got more of a shimmer, rather than flashing lines, which is much less distracting and a little more accurate."  Next they checked if she could distinguish white objects on a black background - a white plate on a black tablecloth - which didn't go so well.  Rhian recalls: "I wasn't quite sure where the plate was. So I left that day with sort of mixed feelings, because the flashing was working but I couldn't see the plate on the table."  She returned the following day to repeat the failed test.  "They did the objects on the table and I could get them and I was so chuffed, I must have looked like a kid at Christmas! I was just locating a plate, a cup and a couple of shapes, but it was difficult because I didn't have any co-ordination. I haven't seen anything through that eye for so long, so I kept overshooting it a little bit - but we were getting there. I was just elated, really elated."  Next, it was time to go outside.  "I was absolutely terrified, because I didn't know what to expect at all. And I was thinking 'oh, I don't want to let anybody down, I don't want to let myself down…' But as it turned out, it was great.  "There was a car, a silver car and I couldn't believe it, because the signal was really strong and that was the sun shining on the silver car. And I was just, well, I was just so excited, I was quite teary!  "Being out in the real world, actually out in the street, you know, is far more useful, than locating flashes on a computer screen and doing the things in the lab. Just to walk under a tree and realising it'd gone dark was amazing, because I hadn't had that.  "Now, when I locate something, especially like a spoon or a fork on the table, it's pure elation, you know. I just get so excited that I've got something right. It's really just pure joy to get something right, because I've never done it before - well, not for the last 16 or 17 years anyway."  The surgical team at the Oxford Eye Hospital, John Radcliffe Hospital have been as delighted as Rhian with her progress.  Although the chip has the resolution power of less than 1% of one megapixel, which is not much compared to a standard phone camera, it has the advantage of being connected to the human brain, which has over 100 billion neurons of processing power.  Using dials on a small wireless power supply held in the hand, Rhian can adjust the sensitivity, contrast and frequency to obtain the best possible signal for different conditions as she continues to practise interpreting the signals and regaining her independence.  If the rest of the trial is successful, it's possible that this implant could be made available on the NHS. The team also hope that one day this technology can be applied to other eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration.

Or is it as misunderstood as it is mouth-watering? And in need of a welcome return to our plates?  As the campaign against sugar has ratcheted up over the past year or two, there have been growing voices trying to redeem fat.  For decades it has been labelled public enemy number one and a "low-fat" food label is used to convince us that what we're buying is healthy.  The problem is low-fat can mean vegetables or just clever marketing for "we took out all the fat and then pumped it full of sugar".  So there I was having a moment in the supermarket - a tub of low-fat yoghurt in one hand and a full-fat one in other - pondering which was actually better for me.  If I had a third hand, it would have been scratching my head. And I'm not alone.  "When there's a huge wall of yoghurt, even I find it paralysing," said Susan Jebb, a nutrition professor at the University of Oxford.  When you take the fat out of products, particularly dry ones like cake or biscuits, then something has to replace it.  "It tends to be sugar - the calories in digestives and low-fat digestives are almost the same," Prof Jebb continued.  "Lots of yoghurts are rammed with sugar, that is the thing that annoys me about yoghurt."  There is a simple answer with yoghurt - a few brands are both low in fat and sugar, although I need to chuck in a bit of fruit to make it palatable.  But what about the case that we should be eating more fat?  Some have argued that the message about cutting all fats when discussing bad saturated fats from processed foods was oversimplified.  While others have made the case that favouring carbohydrates in our diet - particularly refined carbs like white bread and pasta, is playing havoc with our hormones to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and making us pile on the pounds.  Watch: How healthy is your breakfast?  We do all need fat in our diet - it contains essential fatty acids and is important for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and E.  The question has always been: "How much fat should we eat?" And the mantra has been low-fat, high-carb.  The World Health Organization advises that between 30% and 35% of our calories should come from fat arguing there is "no probable or convincing evidence" that the total amount of fat in our diet is altering the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease.  So when it comes to the total amount of fat (and there is a separate argument when we come to consider different types of fat) it's really a question of how it affects our waistlines.  And fat is certainly calorific.  A gram of fat is worth around nine calories - twice the amount as carbohydrate or protein at four calories per gram.  Too much fat, like too much of anything, will make you put on weight and it is incredibly easy to overeat calorie dense foods.  So it appears to be an easy target for people trying to lose weight.  "There is very good evidence that if you cut down on total fat it causes a small reduction in weight, but it's not big," said Dr Lee Hooper from the University of East Anglia in the UK.  She conducted a large review of 32 separate trials, involving around 54,000 people.  It showed people who shifted between 5% and 10% of their calories away from fats lost around 2kg during the studies.  However, she is not convinced the weight-loss is actually down to fat but more a result of people thinking more about what they eat and avoiding burgers, ready meals and other processed foods.  "I suspect they'd do exactly the same thing if they targeted sugar," she concluded.  So how do diets compare when we target carbs?  Doctors at the Harvard School of Public Health in the United States reviewed 53 weight loss trials involving 68,128 people.  The results, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed that both low-carb and low-fat approaches led to decent weight-loss.  But those eating relatively more fat actually lost marginally more weight.  Dr Deirdre Tobias, who led that study, told me: "If you're trying to reduce your calories and you take out the fat then you get a lot of bang for your buck, but that strategy clearly doesn't play out.  "Fat has been villainised because there's a mentality that 'fat makes you fat'. I think our evidence pretty much puts a nail in that coffin."  She is not saying that carbs are the villain instead, but that the best diet is the one you can actually stick to - some people would find it pretty easy to give up on white bread and pasta while others would find it impossible.  But she did warn that focusing on simply avoiding fat risked missing out on known beneficial foods - such as nuts, oily fish and olive oil - or convincing yourself that a low-fat muffin is healthy.  Cutting carbohydrates rather than the fat has also shown some benefit in patients with type-2 diabetes, at least for a short while.  When refined carbs are digested they rapidly lead to a spike in blood sugar levels and in turn of the hormone insulin. People with type 2 have difficulty controlling their blood sugar levels so preventing the spike could help in theory.  Although studies show the advantage of cutting carbs was not sustained in the long-term.  In the UK the total amount of fat being eaten is broadly in line with recommendations, but with slightly more saturated fat than advised.  Dr Hooper concluded: "I would be saying we don't need to be cutting down on fat, but we do need to think of the type of fat."  That's an issue we'll consider on Wednesday when we ask: "Is butter back?"  But clearly there is never going to be health advice to just pour cream down our throats and polish off all the pies and biscuits we can.  Even drowning a salad in olive oil could lead to weight gain.  Going overboard on fat, just as having too much sugar or refined carbohydrate, is a bad thing. Sugar is just stealing the headlines at the moment.  "The reality is that nutrition comes and goes in waves, we've had a fat wave and we're for sure in a sugar frenzy," says Prof Jebb.  She says she worries "enormously" when people reduce all the nation's health problems to being "all about fat or all about sugar".  We need to think about both.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35217418	David Cameron: We'll directly commission 13,000 new homes	The government is "pulling out all the stops" by directly commissioning the building of up to 13,000 homes on public land, ministers say.  Smaller developers will be able to buy sites in England with planning permission in place - with 40% of the new-builds to be so-called "starter homes" aimed at first-time buyers.  PM David Cameron said it was a "huge shift in government policy".  But Labour said he was using "rhetoric to hide his failure on new homes".  Shadow housing minister John Healey said the announcement did not promise new investment or affordable homes beyond those already announced.  Direct commissioning allows the government to assume responsibility for developing land, instead of large building firms.  Communities Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was "pulling out all the stops to get the country building".  "We know that consistently 90% of people aspire to own their own home, and for many years now home ownership has been in decline," he said.  He added that the eight biggest building firms accounted for 50% of the house-building market, and there was a need to involve smaller and medium-sized companies.  Downing Street said the move marked a "radical new policy shift", with up to 13,000 homes set to be built on five publicly-owned sites in 2016 - with up to 40% being affordable "starter" homes.  In December 2014 former Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander announced a pilot plan for the government to "directly commission, build and even sell homes" at a former RAF base in Northstowe, Cambridgeshire.  BBC home editor Mark Easton said the extent of government involvement marked something of an ideological shift for a Conservative administration, adding that starting 13,000 homes represented a "tiny proportion" of the million the government wants built by 2020.  The government wants to build 200,000 starter homes - to be offered to first-time buyers under 40 at a minimum 20% discount price - by 2020.  The discounts apply to properties worth up to £250,000 outside London, or £450,000 in the capital.  A pilot for the scheme will start on five sites:  Where can I afford to live?  Critics of the starter homes scheme say they are still too expensive for many people to afford.  Speaking on a visit to a housing development in Barking Riverside, east London, Mr Cameron said affordable housing was "a house that someone can afford to buy or afford to rent".  "Sometimes I think we get too hung up on these definitions," he said.  "There are hundreds of thousands of Londoners in their 20s, 30s, sometimes in their 40s, who are living in rented accommodation who would love to be able to own their own homes."  The CBI said the announcement "should be a real spur to our ability to build more homes". Housing charity Shelter said it was a "welcome step" but added that starter homes "simply won't be affordable to the vast majority of people in this country".  The government will also announce a £1.2bn fund to help developers prepare underused brownfield land for building.  The move will fast-track the creation of at least 30,000 new starter homes by 2020, Downing Street said.  Shadow housing minister John Healey told BBC News: "If new announcements built new homes, the government would have solved the housing crisis by now."  He described it as a "drop in the ocean" compared with the number of homes needed.  Labour said home ownership was at its "lowest level in a generation".  Mr Healey added: "In the Autumn Statement a few weeks ago, George Osborne tried to spin his halving of public housing investment as an increase. Now David Cameron is laying on the rhetoric to hide his failure on new homes."	politics

Another influential MP told BBC Newsnight the party's leader was guilty of "low-level non-violent misogyny".  Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for appointing men to all three shadow "great offices of state" - chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary.  He is under pressure to give more top roles to women in a reshuffle this week  Forty-three per cent of Labour's MPs are female, but the party leader, deputy leader, chair and London mayoral candidates are all male.  Speaking to BBC Newsnight Harriet Harman, who was acting Labour leader for four months after the party lost the 2015 election, said: "We can't have a men-only leadership when we are party for women and equality.  "Women expect to see men and women working together and we can't have an all-male leadership again and therefore we need to change the rules."  Jeremy Corbyn is believed to have started talks with shadow cabinet members as part of a reshuffle. Existing shadow cabinet members who are reportedly under threat include defence secretary Maria Eagle and chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton.  Jess Phillips, who was elected for Birmingham Yardley in 2015, has also criticised Mr Corbyn for failing to put women in senior positions.  "Had Tony Blair not given any of top jobs to the women - had that same make-up of his team existed - people would rightly have been up in arms," she told BBC Newsnight.  "But it's a bit like some people in the Labour Party are accepting low-level non-violent misogyny because it's Jeremy doing it."  She said she would be prepared to run for the leadership herself at a later date. "It's not something I'm planning on doing anytime soon, but it's absolutely something that I would do in the future."  In another intervention on the issue, Dawn Butler, who chairs the women's Parliamentary Labour Party, said she was concerned about the impact of forthcoming boundary changes on female MPs.  "We can't afford to lose women because it's a fight. My fear is that women will be picked off so I've written to the leader and deputy leader because Tom [Watson] is doing a review and it's a huge worry for me."  A report released last month by the Fabian Society criticised the Labour Party for "poor representation of women at all levels". Women make up 44% of Labour's membership and 43% of Labour's MPs, but just 30% of constituency Labour Party chairs and 16% of Labour council leaders.  Women also account for only 11% of the most senior Labour Party staff.  The same survey also found that women standing for selection as Labour parliamentary candidates were almost three times more likely than men to be asked questions relating to their gender.

In which case, I have to admit a failure.  It's important to point out that I wasn't wholly to blame, what with the government taking me to court and all that.  Nonetheless what I've finally learned isn't a story now - and probably wouldn't have been when I thought it might have been.  Four years ago, I asked what I thought was an entirely innocent question using Freedom of Information laws.  Back in 2010, the coalition government were trumpeting a new red tape-busting cabinet panel, the Reducing Regulation Committee. I suspected that it was all froth and no action, so in 2012 I asked how often they had met since the committee's creation.  Twenty working days later, I thought, I'd get a number closely resembling one, namely the original meeting. How wrong I was, on both fronts.  The Cabinet Office, bored rigid I can only assume, decided to refuse my request on the basis that disclosing the number would impinge on cabinet collective decision-making. Balderdash I thought, or some other word beginning with B.  I therefore appealed, first to the Cabinet Office's own system (turned down) and then to the Information Commissioner's Office. Merry hell ensued. The ICO found in my favour, the Cabinet Office appealed, lost, appealed again, won, the ICO appealed for me, won, etc. Back and forth it went for three years. At one point, the government called in the fearsome-sounding "Treasury Devil", the so-called Star of the Bar, James Eadie QC, to argue their case.  Every few months a kindly solicitor at the ICO's office would email me with the latest twist in a story I had long lost interest in beyond knowing the indefatigable team at the ICO's office were sticking to their guns.  In November, word reached me that the end was nigh. A hapless Cabinet Office official was roundly condemned by a tribunal, who described her evidence as evasive and disingenuous.  Despite my increasing confidence that I'd get my answer, it was still something of a miracle to receive the response from the Cabinet Office on the Friday just before Christmas.  I'm now in a position to exclusively reveal to you, dear reader, that between 2010 and 2012, the Reducing Regulation Committee met on a total of 13 occasions.  You read it here first. Eventually.  Ministers are currently pondering whether to put restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act. In the meantime, how much it cost in legal fees to refuse my request for three years will be the subject of my next FOI request.	politics

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35221163	Dental care in England 'Third World'	Standards of NHS dental care in England have been likened to a "Third World" service, by dentists.  The care, already "unfit for purpose", is becoming even worse, a letter signed by 400 dentists, in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adds.  It says the creation by international charity Dentaid of a service for vulnerable patients in West Yorkshire is a sign of the mounting problems.  An NHS England spokeswoman said: "These claims are wrong - more patients are getting the dental care they need, and 93% of people got an NHS dental appointment when they wanted one in the last 24 months."  The letter urges ministers to be "fully open and transparent" about the limitations of current provision.  The fact Dentaid, normally associated with providing care in the Third World, is now offering emergency care to homeless people, migrants and the low paid in Kirklees "serves to demonstrate the lack of a proper national dental service", it says.  The letter also calls the levels of tooth decay in children a "national disgrace".  Figures published last year by the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed nearly half of eight-year-olds and a third of five-year-olds had signs of decay in their milk teeth.  The Children's Dental Health Survey for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, carried out every 10 years, also found 46% of 15-year-olds had decay in their teeth - although that represented an improvement on the previous survey.	health
health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35221292	E-cigarette may become available on NHS	The UK medicines regulator has approved a brand of e-cigarette to be marketed as an aid to help people stop smoking.  The decision means e-Voke, produced by British American Tobacco, could be prescribed on the NHS.  Public Health England says e-cigarettes are far less harmful than tobacco and help smokers quit.  But some experts, including the British Medical Association, say the benefits and harms are not yet known since e-cigarettes are still relatively new.  The Royal College of GPs said doctors would be reluctant to hand them out to patients without clear merits.  Around 10m adults - one in five - in the UK smoke cigarettes.  Many of these would like to or are actively trying to kick the habit and an increasing number are turning to e-cigarettes, the NHS says.  In the year up to April 2015, two out of three people who used e-cigarettes in combination with the NHS stop smoking service managed to successfully quit.  Prof Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing, Public Health England, says e-cigarettes have become the most popular quitting aid in England.  And he thinks more people should benefit.  "Public Health England wants to see a choice of safe and effective replacements for smoking that smokers themselves want to use," he said.  But Dr Tim Ballard of the Royal College of GPs said it would be unreasonable for the NHS to be asked to fund lifestyle choices for people.  "Potentially, there may be a place for the prescription of e-Voke as part of a smoking cessation programme, but GPs would be very wary of prescribing them until there was clear evidence of their safety and of their efficacy in helping people to quit," he said.  "At the moment there isn't the evidence and the guidance hasn't been written to help GPs make those decisions."  1. On some e-cigarettes, inhalation activates the battery-powered atomiser. Other types are manually switched on  3. The mixture becomes vapour and is inhaled. Many e-cigarettes have an LED light as a cosmetic feature to simulate traditional cigarette glow.  Different brands of e-cigarettes contain different chemical concentrations.  Deborah Arnott of Action on Smoking and Heath (ASH) said: "Electronic cigarettes are a much safer alternative source of nicotine for smokers than cigarettes, but that doesn't mean they are risk-free and we would discourage anyone who's not a smoker from using them.  "It is good news that an electronic cigarette has received a licence from the medicines regulator, as we know that they have been effective in helping smokers quit, and the cost, as part of a quit attempt, will be far lower than treating the diseases caused by smoking."  Another type of nicotine inhaler which closely resembles a cigarette, called Voke, was licensed in 2014 to be marketed as an aid to help people stop smoking.	health

In cities like Sheffield and Hull almost a third of workers can expect higher wages, the living standards think-tank says.  But it fears that could see "one wage towns" where employers cope with higher salaries for their most junior staff by failing to put up pay for more experienced workers.  The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the policy could cost 60,000 jobs.  Paul Harrison, managing director of Sheffield coach firm Central Travel, told the Today programme: "I believe long term we'll probably have to lay people off unless we can put up prices with schools and colleges."  The minimum wage for over-25s will be raised to around £9 by 2020. The Treasury describes this as a National Living Wage.  The Resolution Foundation was mentioned by the Chancellor George Osborne when he announced the higher wage in the summer budget.  It wants city regions that are to be given extra powers - like Manchester and Sheffield - to help businesses with planning and skills shortages.  The Foundation's head Torsten Bell said many firms didn't know how to respond, and local politicians needed to take action.  He said: "They should be focusing on raising awareness in local businesses in their area, particularly in those businesses most affected."  A government spokeswoman said: "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility expects the National Living Wage to cost business just 1% of corporate profits. This will be offset by cutting corporation tax to 18% and reducing national insurance contributions for smaller firms."  Several large employers including Sainsbury's and Lidl have pledged to put up pay before the new rules come in.	politics

She has decided to reveal she is now wearing a wig.  Derbyshire has been producing diaries since she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of July, to try to help demystify the treatment and her third one was recorded across November and December.  Speaking on 1 December, she explains: "It's now six days since the second chemotherapy session and I'm at the stage where I'm feeling a little dispirited.  "One of the things that I'm finding difficult to come to terms with is losing my hair. I would say I have lost about 30-50% of it."  Derbyshire pauses, before taking off her wig to reveal a depleted head of hair, cut above the shoulders.  It is the first time the journalist has made this public. She takes a deep breath, and - with her voice breaking up - says in a quiet tone: "I am finding this hard."  The potential hair loss, along with other side-effects of chemotherapy, was first discussed with her by an oncologist before her treatment began.  Different forms of chemotherapy result in varying levels of hair loss. Some do not cause any loss at all, or only slight thinning.  She was warned, however, that the adjuvant chemotherapy she would be having - designed to help stop cancer coming back or spreading to other parts of the body - usually leads to the loss of "all the hair on your head".  For Derbyshire, this started two-and-a-half weeks after the first cycle of chemotherapy - a clump of hair falling out in the process of getting ready to go to a friend's 40th birthday party.  "I was prepared for it - obviously it's a side-effect of chemotherapy - but it's slightly disconcerting nevertheless," she explains in the diary, holding the hair to the camera.  She had worn a cold cap during her first chemotherapy session. Tightly fitted and so cold it forms ice inside, it was designed to minimise hair loss. She wore a newer, more advanced model in the second and third sessions - although the hair loss continued to a much lesser extent.  In the eight days that followed the second cycle, however - in which she "bounced back" and recovered from the treatment - she began to adjust to the hair loss.  "I have got used to wearing a wig, which is something I never thought I'd be able to say," she explains on Christmas Eve.  "The idea a few weeks ago of wearing a wig absolutely horrified me. It represented stress, it represented something peculiar and not me. Now, I can put it on in five minutes in the morning."  It is this practical aspect that has helped her come to terms with the hairpiece.  Between Christmas and New Year's Day, she adds: "We went to a friend's Christmas party the other day and when we got back my youngest son whispered to me and said 'mummy, no-one would have known you were wearing a wig'.  "Maybe they did know and they were just too polite to say anything, but the point is it lets me crack on and get on with things - which is absolutely great."  Over the past month Derbyshire has presented her BBC Two programme while wearing a wig, but has not drawn attention to it.  Now, she now feels the time is right to be open both with colleagues and in public.  "When I started wearing a wig a few weeks ago I didn't tell anyone at work I was wearing one, because I needed a little time to adjust to it myself. I can confirm I'm now fully adjusted to it and so feel comfortable in being totally open about it," she says, smiling.  "But we are a close-knit team at work and they are a bunch of journalists so I'm guessing they've sussed it already," she jokes. "If they haven't, I'll be a bit disappointed to be honest."  Derbyshire, however, is keen not to downplay the emotional toll of losing her hair.  "It has been the thing that has affected me the most, more than a mastectomy," she says, having undergone surgery in September 2015.  The presenter has three chemotherapy sessions and a series of radiotherapy sessions remaining before her treatment concludes in the spring. She expects more hair loss to occur and has started to lose parts of her eyebrows.  Hair loss, however, is almost always temporary, with hair growing back after treatment ends.  Derbyshire is certainly keeping this positive thought at the front of her mind. "Roll on 2016," she says.  The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	health

health	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35150598	Is breakfast a waste of time?	Breakfast is the most important meal of the day - it's a great start, it's good for you, it stops you snacking, boosts metabolism and keeps you thin.  Well, that's what we've all been told.  But some scientists argue this is all a myth - and that just because we keep repeating it doesn't make it true.  So should we bother with breakfast?  Studies repeatedly show that skipping breakfast is more common in people who are overweight or obese.  But this could be a dangerous trap - when the number of ice cream sales goes up so does the number of people getting sunburn. It doesn't mean ice-cream is causing sunburn.  This association might be down to something special about brekkie - or maybe the type of people who eat it are generally more active, have a better overall diet or try to lead healthier lives.  Despite advocating breakfast as part of a healthy lifestyle, a report by the UK's National Obesity Observatory concluded that "it is not clear whether there is a causal relationship with Body Mass Index (weight) or whether breakfast is merely a marker for other lifestyle factors that can contribute to healthy body weight".  The few clinical trials that have actively altered people's eating habits also showed no impact on waistlines.  The biggest, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, told 300 overweight or obese people to skip or eat breakfast for four months.  "There was absolutely no difference whatsoever in the amount of weight-loss," said Prof David Allison, who conducted that trial at the University of Alabama.  "With respect to weight, at least in adults, it looks like we're leaning towards it [breakfast] being a myth."  He says people who are skipping breakfast are probably just trying to control their own weight.  And one danger for skippers who start having breakfast is it could lead to weight gain, if they don't eat less later in the day.  In Prof Allison's opinion: "If they are advising it [breakfast] for weight control then at this point it is not a justified recommendation."  Dr Alison Tedstone is from one of the many organisations around the world that tells us breakfast is a good thing, and she points to studies showing people who skip breakfast tend to be bigger, which we already know is an association.  But Dr Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, agrees that the "evidence is by no means conclusive on having breakfast".  However, she says it is the easiest meal of the day to get right, that skipping it risks snacking on something unhealthy later on and that it can be a struggle to get the right balance of nutrients without starting the day well.  "It's an easy meal to get a healthy meal, it's an easy meal to get control over."  There is no such thing as a perfect breakfast, but Dr Tedstone advises people to "think fibre" in the mornings.  "Overall we're not getting enough fibre in our diet and it's easy to incorporate fibre into breakfast.  "Take porridge - it's cheap, it's cheerful," she said.  As well as porridge, high fibre breakfasts include fruit, wholegrain toast and some breakfast cereals.  But some of the more palatable high-fibre cereals can be loaded with added salt and sugar.  Prof Susan Jebb, a nutrition scientist at the University of Oxford says: "It is very difficult, I think breakfast cereals are very challenging."  She says it's necessary to check the labels as some have less added sugar and that fresh, stewed or dried fruit could be used to make it more palatable.  "I'd encourage people to have a piece of fruit with breakfast - much better to have fruit than fruit juice as then you get the fibre from the intact fruit."  The other big case made for breakfast is that it improves children's performance in school.  A study in 2015 by the University of Cardiff was the latest to show an association between a healthy breakfast and educational performance in the classroom.  These studies are now coming in for the same criticism as those that found a link between breakfast and weight.  "It seems very plausible that missing breakfast as a kid is just a marker of a poor home background - that family is unable to provide breakfast for a child - which is probably the cause of them not performing well at school," argues Prof David Rogers at the University of Bristol.  So how do we make sense of all this?  Prof Jebb argues: "If you're currently eating breakfast I think you should make it the healthiest breakfast you can.  "If you're a breakfast skipper, I'm certainly not going to say you must eat breakfast, but I would encourage you to think about it."  While Prof Allison suggests people who are worried about their weight should give both eating and skipping breakfast a go to see what works best for them - just make sure you're not snacking on sausage rolls by 11:00.  The science behind the benefits of breakfast does not support the absolute vehemence with which it is advocated, at least in adults.  That said I'm still going to have my bowl of breakfast cereal.  It is a good start to the day for me personally otherwise I'm distractingly hungry. I might even try chucking in a bit of extra fruit.	health

The "sugar smart app", from Public Health England, works by scanning barcodes and revealing total sugar in cubes or grams.  Officials hope it will help combat tooth decay, obesity and type two diabetes and encourage families to choose healthier alternatives.  PHE says young children are eating three times more than the sugar limit.  Its new Change4Life advertising campaign, which includes the sugar app, suggests that on average children aged four to ten years old are consuming 22kg of added sugar a year.  That's about 5,500 sugar cubes - more than the weight of an average five-year-old child.  The app has been developed to raise awareness of how much sugar is contained in everyday food and drink.  It works on more than 75,000 products, offering a quick guide to help parents to assess potential purchases that may harm their children's health.  Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist from Public Health England, said children were having too much sugar in their diets and this was leading to painful tooth decay, weight gain and the potential for serious health problems in later life.  Overweight and obese adults are more at risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.  "If there's one thing I'd strongly encourage parents to do, and that's to swap sugary drinks out of their kids' diets for either a low-sugar drink or water or low-fat milk, which would be a really excellent choice."  She also said people might be surprised to discover the sugar contents, for example, of some yogurts and fruit drinks.  PHE has previously said it supported a sugar tax to help people cut down on the sugar they eat.  It has also called for reduced marketing of sugary food and drinks towards children in stores, on TV and online as well as fewer price promotions on sugar-laden products.  The sugar smart app is free to download from app stores.	health

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35214487	UK should 'degender' passports, says Maria Miller	Passports and driving licences should not state if the holder is male or female because it causes "problems" for transgender people, a Tory MP has said.  Maria Miller, chair of the Commons Women and Equalities committee, said a person's sex was "not relevant" on official documents, and it created an "unconscious bias" in job applications.  Gender details on passports also do not assist with identification, she added.  The committee will publish a report on transgender discrimination next week.  In an interview with the Times newspaper, Ms Miller said gender stereotyping can be as "damaging" for men as women.  "For individuals who have decided to transition but haven't necessarily got the right documentation, it can cause problems," she said.  "Why do we need gender on our driving licence? Why do we have to have it on our passport if it doesn't really aid identification? It's not relevant.  "Australia has decided to degender their passports."  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party had pushed for the change during the coalition government's term in office.  "This is not as radical an idea as it might seem - other countries like Australia have already introduced it and it is accepted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  "It is frankly ridiculous that even on something this small the Tories have refused to act over the last few years."	politics

In a new year message, the PM said he was determined to "secure our future" with the EU referendum, which could be held this year.  Jeremy Corbyn said 2016 would mark the "start of the journey" towards a Labour government.  In his new year's message, the Labour leader pledged to fight austerity.  Leaders of other political parties have also issued new year messages. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 2016 would be "a year of optimism", while Nigel Farage tweeted: "Let's make 2016 the year that the UK votes to leave the European Union."  Mr Corbyn, who has faced criticism from some MPs since winning the leadership election in September, said he was elected "on a mandate for change".  With his first major electoral tests looming in May's local and devolved administration elections, he said his party would "offer a real alternative: a politics that gives people a say in the decisions that affect them, and an economy based on long-term investment, instead of self-defeating austerity".  The Labour leader said he would tackle David Cameron's government "much more" on cuts to local councils and lack of investment.  Mr Cameron said some people choose to "shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions".  He added: "But we're the ones who are able to make the arguments and take the difficult decisions in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security. So while others are on protest marches, we remain on the long walk to a greater Britain."  He promised "real social renewal" in tackling poverty and improving social mobility, repeated pledges on house-building and said the government would "respond with vigour" to an extremism review later in the year.  Tim Farron used his first New Year's message as Liberal Democrat leader to criticise Labour and the Tories for being divided.  He criticised government cuts to Universal Credit and policing and said more should be done to support refugees fleeing Syria.  Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted 2016 to be "a year of optimism and ambition" with supporting enterprise and innovation in public services her priority, while leaders of Scottish Labour and the Scottish Green Party set their sights on May's Holyrood elections.  Leaders of Wales' four political parties also looked ahead to the 2016 elections, with Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood pledging to travel the "length and breadth" of the country and making the case for her party.  Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the membership of her party had more than trebled in 2015, and she was determined to turn the "Green surge into Green votes" this year.	politics

A survey found that 42% of the public think there is no point in keeping up contact at this stage.  But the Alzheimer's Society said family visits stimulated feelings of happiness, comfort and security.  Even as the condition progresses, it said people with dementia can still hold an "emotional memory".  This means they continue to feel happy long after a visit or experience that they may have forgotten.  The charity is calling on people to visit friends and relatives with dementia regularly and help them take part in activities they enjoy.  In a separate survey by the charity of 300 people affected by dementia, more than half said they were no longer taking part in any, or hardly any, social activities.  And 64% said they felt isolated following their diagnosis.  Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of Alzheimer's Society, said: "After spending time with friends and family over the festive period, New Year can be a bleak and lonely time for people with dementia and their carers. It's so important for people with dementia to feel connected throughout the year.  "Spending time with loved ones and taking part in meaningful activities can have a powerful and positive impact, even if they don't remember the event itself. We're urging people to get in touch with us and find out how we can help you stay connected."  A survey of more than 4,000 members of the public indicated that 68% would still visit someone with dementia who no longer recognised them.  However the charity says that people's busy lives often mean they don't manage to follow up on these good intentions, leaving many living with dementia feeling isolated.  There are around 850,000 people with dementia in the UK.	health
